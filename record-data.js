		"name": "Mick Abrahams",
		"biography": "<p>Mick Abraham's was one of the more unfortunate hard-luck stories in rock music. Best known for his work on Jethro Tull's debut album, This Was, where he played blues licks that had critics comparing him favorably to Eric Clapton, he left the group, and since then has never managed to achieve lasting success as a recording artist, or the world-class fame of his former bandmates. Leading various incarnations of his best-known band, Blodwyn Pig, he has persevered over the last quarter century, and achieved some major cult recognition, especially in England.</p><p>Abraham's joined his first band, the Crusaders, in 1964, alongside pianist Graham Waller, drummer (and Screaming Lord Sutch/Cyril Davies veteran) Carlo Little, and bassist Alex Dmochowski, all backing singer Neil Christian. Abraham's' musical hero was Alexis Korner, the man who -- with Cyril Davies -- brought blues to England. He was one of that legion of young guitarists, which included Brian Jones and Keith Richards, who found their way into music through Korner's groundbreaking work with Blues Incorporated. In 1965, Abraham's and Waller joined the Toggery Five, a septet whose members included drummer Clive Bunker. That group had a momentary brush with the record books when they cut a Mick Jagger-Keith Richards song as a failed single, but otherwise were unable to make any lasting impression.</p><p>In the summer of 1967, while playing in his next group, McGregory's Engine with Bunker, Abraham's met Ian Anderson and bassist Glenn Cornick, who were playing in a group called John Evans' Smash. After comparing notes on their shared enthusiasm for blues, they decided to form Jethro Tull. Abraham's remained with the group until November of 1968, and his guitar was very prominent in the group's sound during this period, revealing him to be one of the best among England's legions of bluesmen. Evidence of his skill, passion, and persuasiveness are all over their second single, ~A Song for Jeffrey,~ and the album This Was. Anderson's voice and flute, however, quickly challenged Abraham's for primacy, and by the fall of 1968 Anderson had won that battle; in November, Abraham's was gone.</p><p>Early in 1969, Abraham's formed his own group, Blodwyn Pig, with Jack Lancaster on saxophone, ex-McGregory's Engine member Andy Pyle on bass, and Ron Berg on drums. This was a blues band through-and-through, and even arriving on the scene in a time when London was filled with white blues players, Blodwyn Pig quickly became a critical favorite with its performances and its first album, Ahead Rings Out. Considered a classic progressive blues album, the record found a small audience in the United States, while in England it was a Top Ten album. The group's second long-player, Getting to This, released a year later, was received with enthusiasm as well, and also made the British Top Ten.</p><p>The group was riven by internal conflicts, however, as Lancaster and the other members expressed a desire to go in a somewhat different direction in their music, and for Lancaster's sax to become more prominent. Abraham's left the band in 1970, to be replaced by ex-Yes guitarist Peter Banks and guitarist/singer Larry Wallis. The group continued on under the leadership of Lancaster, although it was eventually renamed Lancaster's Bomber. Initially Abraham's formed a new group called Wommet; it was very short-lived, however, so he reorganized his career around the Mick Abraham's Band, with Walt Monaghan on bass, Bob Sargeant on guitar, keyboards and vocals, and Ritchie Dharma on drums. He released two albums on Chrysalis, Mick Abraham's and At Last, with his former Blodwyn Pig bandmate Lancaster expanding the lineup to a quintet. Neither sold very well, although Abraham's was never at a loss for paying gigs.</p><p>In 1974, Abraham's reformed Blodwyn Pig with his ex-Tull bandmate Bunker, Pyle, and Lancaster, but the group only lasted a few gigs before breaking up. Meanwhile, Abraham's virtually left the music business, but not before he recorded what proved to be his biggest selling solo album of all, an instructional record entitled Learning to Play Guitar With Mick Abraham's. He continued to play occasional shows, but made his living outside of music, working as a driver, lifeguard, and financial consultant. He seemed content to play the odd impromptu show at the local pub, or for causes that mattered to him in his home town of Dunstable.</p><p>Finally, in 1988, however, he re-formed Blodwyn Pig with Andy Pyle back in the lineup on bass, ex-Bonzo Dog Band member Dick Heckstall-Smith and Bernie Hetherington on saxes, Bruce Boardman on keyboards, and Clive Bunker on drums. The re-formed group was a success, releasing a well-received album called All Said and Done. Their 1993 lineup, including new keyboardist Dave Lennox, Mike Summerland on bass, and Graham Walker on drums, released the album Lies, Blodwyn Pig's most accomplished album ever. The group later issued a live recording from their 1993 tour (where Abraham's was reunited with Ian Anderson at one gig), entitled All Tore Down. Abraham's continues to play and record regularly, with a following in England and America with Blodwyn Pig. As of the mid-'90s, the group consisted of a quartet of Abrahams, Walker, Lennox, and Summerland, with vocalist Jackie Challenor and sax-player Nick Payne augmenting their membership in the studio.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>",

		"biography": "<p>Australian-born Geoff Achison earned a reputation in the mid-'90s as one of the more acclaimed young blues guitarists, including winning the Albert King Award for most promising guitarist in 1995, leading to an endorsement deal with Gibson Guitars. Born in Victoria, Achison made his way to Melbourne and learned the blues from local artists. His recorded debut arrived with Big Machine in 1994 and the record garnered strong notices from critics and fans alike. Following his Albert King Award win at the 12th Annual International Blues Talent Competition in Memphis, Achison released the solo acoustic album Mystery Train, earning him more critical accolades. Gettin' Evil (1999) featured his U.S. touring band the Soul Diggers backing him and Live at St. Andrews and Souldiggin' in the U.K. were issued over the next two years (the latter being a live studio recording). Keeping a relentless touring schedule, Achison spent a portion of 2000 on the road in the States with Hot Tuna and has taught at Jorma Kaukonen's Fur Peace Guitar Ranch.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Tom Demalon</strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>With the list of contenders vying for the ‘Australian Blues album of the Year’ seemingly growing each week, Melbourne’s Geoff Achison has thrown his hat in the ring, with the release of “Sovereign Town”, a collection of 12 songs, which are inspired by the gold rush in Victoria, around the 1850’s.  The album was recorded in Ballarat, a town steeped in gold mining history and part of the “Golden Triangle”, close to where Achison grew up. He recalls the area and remembers exploring the old diggings, when he was a kid, so this is almost a revisit to those childhood memories and his journey through life and as a musician.</p><p>For this album, Geoff has eased off the tempo and rocking blues we are somewhat used to with his Souldiggers band, delivering an album of mostly chilled out, easy listening solo work which would suit any lazy afternoon, with sun blazing down and a nice bottle of red breathing in the sea breeze – well that how I’ve been listening to it and it works a treat!  For me personally, it’s been a difficult album to review because a lot of the attraction to this is in the lyrics, and to delve deeper into that I would need to break each track down in real detail – so I’ll leave that for you to explore & enjoy.</p><p>So, onto the music, and we start with a simple percussion & double bass intro which leads us into the opening track ‘Skeleton Kiss’, with Geoff’s gravel-like vocals and mellow acoustic guitar playing setting the tone for the album.  ‘Miniature Men’ & ‘Walk Away’ continue the relaxed rhythm, as we ebb & flow along with Geoff.  The title track ‘Sovereign Town’ picks the pace up ever so slightly with some beautiful finger picking acoustic work.  ‘Wandsworth Bridge’ is a track full of lyrics of lost loves and heartbreak, with a wonderful gentle electric solo in the middle.  ‘Misha Bella’ takes us on an almost jazz-blues trip, with some incredible guitar work once more and jazz club drum beat and Hammond Organ-like keys.  The album takes a completely different turn with the upbeat ‘Small Town Crime’, which caught me by surprise – pleasantly I may add – as I was “in the zone” so to speak, but I was soon back there with the outstanding ‘World of Blue’, one of my favourites on the album, with its haunting slide guitar apparent throughout the track.  ‘Sleepwalking’ is another one of my favourites and it’s so great to hear Geoff being able to display his outstanding acoustic work throughout, without the temptation to “rock it up” at any time on the album.  The beautiful instrumental track ‘Hand of Faith’ displays some almost Spanish-like acoustic guitar playing (I even opened a bottle of Rioja at this point), before ‘Rescue the Past’ pulls us back with a slightly quicker tempo with nice chorus and slide solo work.  The album closes with ‘Coolbardie Sunrise’, another instrumental that showcases Geoff’s amazing finger picking talents, which is played on his “Regal” resonator.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Sean Bennett</strong><p>"

		"biography": "<p>Will Ackerman has gained prominence both as a musician and a businessman, and at least one of those occupations seems to have been unintentional. Though Ackerman has played guitar since the age of 12, when he dropped out of college it was to become a carpenter, and his first company was called Windham Hill Builders. But Ackerman composed guitar music for Stanford University theater productions, and the encouragement of friends led him to record an album of his tunes, In Search of the Turtle's Navel, in 1976. The album was surprisingly successful, and Ackerman found himself in the music business.</p><p>Since then, Ackerman has continued to record his own albums, to produce Windham Hill albums for such other artists as George Winston, Alex de Grassi, and Liz Story, and to serve in various capacities in the record company. (He stepped down as CEO in 1986; his function now primarily concerns A&R, the liaison between a record company and its artists.) Though Ackerman has long since sickened of the new age tag, threatening physical violence against anyone categorizing Windham Hill's music with the term, he had more to do with the rise of acoustic-based instrumental music as a popular form in the '70s and '80s than anyone else.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>",

		"firstname": "Ryan",
		"lastname": "Adams",
		"name": "Ryan Adams",
		"biography": "<p>Mixing the heartfelt angst of a singer/songwriter with the cocky brashness of a garage rocker, Ryan Adams is at once one of the few artists to emerge from the alt-country scene to achieve mainstream commercial success and the one who most strongly refused to be defined by the genre, leaping from one spot to another stylistically while following his increasingly prolific muse. Adams was born in Jacksonville, North Carolina in 1974. While country music was a major part of his family's musical diet when he was young (he's cited Loretta Lynn, George Jones, Merle Haggard, and Johnny Cash as particular favorites), in his early teens Adams developed a taste for punk rock and began playing electric guitar.</p><p>At 15, Adams started writing songs, and a year later he formed a band called the Patty Duke Syndrome; Adams once described PDS as ~an arty noise punk band,~ with Hüsker Dü frequently cited as a key influence and reference point. the Patty Duke Syndrome developed a following in Jacksonville, and when Adams was 19 the band relocated to the larger town of Raleigh, North Carolina in hopes of expanding its following. However, Adams became eager to do something more melodic that would give him a platform for his country and pop influences. In 1994, Adams left the Patty Duke Syndrome and formed Whiskeytown with guitarist Phil Wandscher and violinist Caitlin Cary. With bassist Steve Grothman and drummer Eric ~Skillet~ Gilmore completing the lineup, Whiskeytown (the name came from regional slang for getting drunk) released their first album, Faithless Street, on the local Mood Food label.</p><p>The album won reams of critical praise in the music press, and more than one writer suggested that Whiskeytown could do for the alt-country or No Depression scene what Nirvana had done for grunge. But by the time Whiskeytown had signed to a major label -- the Geffen-distributed imprint Outpost Records -- the band had undergone the first in a series of major personal shakeups, and in the summer of 1997, when Whiskeytown's Outpost debut, Stranger's Almanac, was ready for release, Adams and Wandscher were the only official members of the group left. Cary soon returned, but Wandscher left shortly afterward, and Whiskeytown had a revolving-door lineup for much of the next two years, with the band's live shows become increasingly erratic, as solid performances were often followed by noisy, audience-baiting disasters. Consequently, as strong as Stranger's Almanac was, Whiskeytown never fulfilled the commercial expectations created for them by others. In 1999, the band -- which was down to Adams, Cary, and a handful of session musicians -- recorded its third and final album, Pneumonia, but when Geffen was absorbed in a merger between PolyGram and Universal, Outpost was phased out, and the album was shelved; shortly afterward, Whiskeytown quietly called it quits.</p><p>Following Whiskeytown's collapse, Adams wasted no time launching a career apart from the band, and after a few solo acoustic tours, Adams went into a Nashville studio with songwriters Gillian Welch and David Rawlings and cut his first album under his own name, Heartbreaker, which was released by pioneering ~insurgent country~ label Bloodshot Records in 2000. The album received critical raves, respectable sales, and a high-profile endorsement from Elton John, and Adams was signed by Universal's new Americana imprint, Lost Highway Records. Lost Highway gave Whiskeytown's Pneumonia a belated release in early 2001, and later that same year the label released his second solo set, Gold, which displayed less of a country influence in favor of classic pop and rock styles of the 1970s. In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the album's opening track, ~New York, New York,~ was embraced by radio as an anthem of resilience (though it actually concerned a busted romance), and Adams once again found himself touted as ~the next big thing.~</p><p>Always a prolific songwriter, in a bit more than a year following Gold's release, Adams had written and recorded enough material for four albums. He opted to whittle the 60 tunes down to a 13-song collection called Demolition, which was released in 2002 as he went into the studio to record his official follow-up to Gold. A year later, Adams' concept album Rock N Roll was released alongside the double-EP collection Love Is Hell. Tours around the globe kept Adams busy into the next year as he maintained momentum writing songs and keeping his ever-changing presence in the music press. In May 2005, Adams released his first of three albums for Lost Highway, the melancholic double-disc Cold Roses. Jacksonville City Nights, a more classic-sounding honky tonk effort, followed in September, and 29 appeared in late December. Always prolific, in the interim period before his next album was released Adams posted a large selection of tracks -- including several hip-hop tunes -- on his website, but fans were greeted with more straightforward material on 2007's Easy Tiger and 2008's Cardinology with the Cardinals.</p><p>Adams decided to disband the Cardinals in 2009, precipitating an unusual period of quiet from the prolific singer/songwriter. He slowly returned to active duty in 2010, releasing the heavy metal Orion on vinyl-only in the summer and then issuing III/IV -- a double album recorded with the Cardinals during the Easy Tiger sessions -- in November. For his 13th solo album, 2011's Ashes and Fire, the singer/songwriter recruited Norah Jones and Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers' keyboard player Benmont Tench, as well as legendary producer Glyn Johns, who helmed the Who classic Who’s Next.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>As Whiskeytown finally ground to a halt in the wake of an astonishing number of personal changes following Faithless Street (coupled with record company problems that kept their final album, Pneumonia, from reaching stores until two years after it was recorded), Ryan Adams ducked into a Nashville studio for two weeks of sessions with Gillian Welch and David Rawlings. While arch traditionalists Welch and Rawlings would hardly seem like a likely match for alt-country's bad boy, the collaboration brought out the best in Adams; Heartbreaker is loose, open, and heartfelt in a way Whiskeytown's admittedly fine albums never were, and makes as strong a case for Adams' gifts as anything his band ever released. With the exception of the Stones-flavored ~Shakedown on 9th Street~ and the swaggering ~To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, Is to Be High),~ Heartbreaker leaves rock & roll on the shelf in favor of a sound that blends low-key folk-rock with a rootsy, bluegrass-accented undertow, and while the album's production and arrangements are subtle and spare, they make up in emotional impact whatever they lack in volume. As a songwriter, Adams concerns himself with the ups and downs of romance rather than the post-teenage angst that dominated Whiskeytown's work, and ~My Winding Wheel~ and ~Damn, Sam (I Love a Woman That Rains)~ are warmly optimistic in a way he's rarely been before, while ~Come Pick Me Up~ shows he's still eloquently in touch with heartbreak. Adams has always been a strong vocalist, but his duet with Emmylou Harris on ~Oh My Sweet Carolina~ may well be his finest hour as a singer, and the stripped-back sound of these sessions allows him to explore the nooks and crannies of his voice, and the results are pleasing. Whiskeytown fans who loved the ~Replacements-go-twang~ crunch of ~Drank Like a River~ and ~Yesterday's News~ might have a hard time warming up to Heartbreaker, but the strength of the material and the performances suggest Adams is finally gaining some much-needed maturity, and his music is all the better for it.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>"

Appropriately enough, <I>Demolition</I> sounds less like ~the third Ryan Adams album~ than a collection of stray tunes — some of which are very good, especially the lazy summer vibe of ~Tennessee Sucks,~ the up-tempo acoustic twang of ~Chin Up, Cheer Up,~ the winsome ~Cry on Demand,~ and the heading-off-the-rails rocker ~Starting to Hurt.~ But more than a few of the other songs on the album sound like rough drafts rather than completed works, and <I>Demolition</I> seems to lack a strong thematic or structural center.</p> <p>In short, <I>Demolition</I> sounds like a bunch of demos, which of course is just what it is, and while it preserves a few strong tunes and offers an insight into Adams' creative process, it also makes clearthat even the rising wunderkind of Americana can benefit from a bitof judicious editing and polishing.</p><p> &mdash; <B>Mark Deming</B> &mdash; AllMusic</p><p>It's been just under a year (365 days to be exact - but this year was a leap year) since Ryan Adams released <EM>Gold</EM>, the album by which he truly broke into the mainstream music collective. Over this time Adams has gone from former-Whiskeytown frontman to having his ~New York~ become an anthem for the 9/11 attacks, and having his ~When The Stars Go Blue~ be performed live by The Corrs with Bono. Now that's quite a year for countrified folk-rocker.</p><P>During this time (and in the time before) Adams also managed to record a crapload of demos. Originally toying with the idea of releasing these 60 tracks over four discs, his label (luckily) opted to trim these down to thirteen - the results of which being <EM>Demolition</EM>. (Get it? ~Demo~-lition? Pretty clever, eh?)</P><P>Anyway, <EM>Demolition</EM> follows in a much similar vein as <EM>Gold</EM>, and given the quality, could have rightly been <EM>Gold</EM>'s true follow-up. As is usual with Adams, the high points are many, but are most prevalent on the album's lighter moments. The simple piano and guitar of ~Cry On Demand~ and the tongue-in-cheek lyrical balladry of ~Tennesee Sucks~ offer Adams at his most impressive. The Smiths-rock of ~Starting to Hurt,~ doesn't fare too badly either. The minimalist depression of the closing ~Jesus (Don't Touch My Baby),~ however, is one of Adams finest (and bravest) moments<EM>ever</EM>.</P><P>Still, it's not all praises of glory for Adams. As a set of what's really just a bunch of outtakes, there are the inevitable bombs. The opening ~Nuclear~ shows why Adams is not really a <EM>rock</EM> star: he just can't rock out that well. The guitar riff of ~Dear Chicago~ bears a striking similarity to Dog's Eye View (remember them?), and that's just not all that cool.</P>"

				"review": "<p>Last time we received a dispatch from Ryan Adams, the self-styled savior of rock & roll, it was in 2003, when he delivered his straight-up rock & roll record (aptly titled <i>Rock N Roll</i>) and his two-part mope-rock EP (later combined as one LP) <i>Love Is Hell</i>. Admirable records both, but not quite the sequel to <i>Heartbreaker</i> that fans craved. They also weren't quite as successful as all the hype surrounding their release suggested that they would be, so Adams briefly retreated from the spotlight to regroup, heading back in 2005 with a planned triptych of new albums, the first of which is the double-album <i>Cold Roses</i>, recorded with his new backing band the Cardinals and released at the beginning of May. Three albums in one year is overkill even for an artist predisposed to releasing his every whim, and while it's too early at this writing to judge whether he needed to release all three of the records, it's safe to say that <i>Cold Roses</i> is the record many fans have been waiting to hear -- a full-fledged, unapologetic return to the country-rock that made his reputation when he led Whiskeytown. Not that the album is a retreat, or a crass attempt to give the people what they want, but it's an assured, comfortable collection of 18 songs that play to Adams' strengths because they capture him not trying quite so hard.</p> <p>He settles into a warm, burnished, countryish groove not far removed from vintage Harvest-era Neil Young at the beginning and keeps it going over the course of a double-disc set that isn't all that long. With the first disc clocking in at 39:39 and the second at 36:29, this could easily have been released as a single-disc set, but splitting it into two and packaging it as a mock-gatefold LP is classic Ryan Adams, highlighting both his flair for rock classicism and his tendency to come across slightly affected. As always, he's so obsessive about fitting into classic rock's long lineage that he can be slightly embarrassing -- particularly on the intro to ~Beautiful Sorta,~ which apes David Johansen's intro to the New York Dolls' ~Looking for a Kiss~ in a way that guarantees a cringe -- which is also a problem when he drifts toward lazy, profanity-riddled lyrics (~this sh*t just f*cks you up~ on ~Cherry Lane~) that undercut a generally strong set of writing. But what makes <i>Cold Roses</i> a success, his first genuine one since <i>Heartbreaker</i>, is that it is a genuine band album, with the Cardinals not only getting co-writing credits but helping Adams relax and let the music flow naturally. It's not the sound of somebody striving to save rock & roll, or even to be important, but that's precisely why this is the easiest Ryan Adams to enjoy. The coming months with their coming LPs will reveal whether this is indeed a shift in his point of view, or just a brief break from his trademark blustering braggadocio.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<p>Ever since the big, splashy Gold failed to make Ryan Adams an all-conquering superstar -- it bolstered his reputation as a rock critic darling, but never had the sales to match the press -- he's retreated to genre exercises, beginning with the sleek modern rock of 2003's Rock N Roll and its moody alt-rock counterpart, Love Is Hell, carrying through to his Neil Young/Grateful Dead pastiche on his spring 2005 double album, Cold Roses, and now its autumn sequel, Jacksonville City Nights. Arriving a little over four months after Cold Roses as the second installment of a planned trilogy of 2005 releases, Jacksonville City Nights -- which at one point was going to be called the less-evocative but calendar-specific September -- is Adams' straight-up, straight-ahead country album, a lean 46-minute collection of 14 songs designed for late-night drinking. While the terrific cover art deliberately echoes classic '60s country LPs, the sound of the album isn't quite as honky tonk as that suggests, thanks to a handful of brooding numbers like ~September~ that are too introspective, lyric-centered, and light on melody to truly qualify as classicist country. These are the weakest moments here, but they're also the exception to the rule, since most of the songs here represent a number of classic country archetypes, from the opening pair of barroom anthems, ~A Kiss Before I Go~ and ~The End,~ to his ~Dear John~ duet with Norah Jones or the light hillbilly swagger of the galloping ~Trains~ and how ~My Heart Is Broken~ is sweetened by just enough swings to give it a candy coating but not enough to turn it into countrypolitan schmaltz. As good as these cuts sound, it's still hard not to shake the suspicion that Ryan Adams is primarily a pastiche artist, since it's not only easy to spot influences throughout the album, but because the atmosphere of the record makes more of an impression than the individual songs. That said, Jacksonville City Nights still ranks as one of Adams' stronger albums, not just because he's returning to his rootsy roots -- after all, this isn't alt-country, this is pure country -- but because it maintains a consistent mood, is tightly edited and well sequenced, and thanks to the Cardinals, has the easy assurance of Cold Roses, which is preferable to the somewhat desperate feel of the records immediately following Heartbreaker. It may not all add up to a major statement, which is something Gold and Rock N Roll aspired to be, but it surely makes for a more likeable and ultimately more listenable album.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

The bulk of his reputation and legacy rests, understandably, with the Allman Brothers Band, but there were enough outside projects to justify a pair of anthology collections. Either one is the place to start musically, with the first set also containing a wonderful extended essay on his life and career, but serious fans will obviously want the entire albums from which a lot of those tracks, even the session work, were pulled.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>",

For many years, he was a highly respected session musician, playing on cuts by Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin, King Curtis, Boz Scaggs, Delaney & Bonnie, and Clarence Carter, among others. By including those session cuts, as well as a sampling of his brief sojourn in Eric Clapton's Derek and the Dominoes and a few rare solo tracks, along with a number of representative Allman Brothers songs, the double-album Anthology winds up drawing a complete portrait of Allman.

		"name": "Greg Allman",
		"biography": "<p>Gregg Allman's most visible contribution to rock music is as lead singer, organist, and songwriter with the Allman Brothers Band, founded by his brother Duane (d. 1971) in 1969. He has never threatened to eclipse the band that carries his family name, but he has found occasional success and popularity with his solo work, which is distinctly different, more soulful and less focused on high-wattage virtuosity.</p><p>Allman's instrument is the organ, and he is most effective, when he is in top form, as a singer. His first instrument, ironically enough, was the guitar, and he took it up before his older brother Duane did. But Duane learned it better and quickly eclipsed Gregg. Where Gregg did excel was on the organ and as a singer (a role Duane was never comfortable with), which proved important but not at the center of a group that became famous for its 40-minute instrumental jams and three-hour sets. Through their early efforts, in bands like the Allman Joys and the Hour Glass, they shared the spotlight, with Duane taking the lengthy solos and Gregg fronting the band and offering Booker T. Jones-type keyboard playing. Liberty Records signed the Hour Glass and tried making Gregg into the focus of their efforts during the late '60s, but it never quite worked.</p><p>When the Allman Brothers were organized, the flashy (and vital) instrumental moments belonged to his brother and Dickey Betts and, later still, Warren Haynes. Gregg's songs, however, including ~Whipping Post~ and ~Midnight Rider,~ were among the group's notable originals during its classic period, 1969-1972. Beginning with Brothers and Sisters, Betts' songwriting and singing assumed increasing prominence.</p><p>It was during the period that Brothers and Sisters was burning up the charts that Gregg Allman emerged as a solo artist with his first album, the critically well-received hit Laid Back, which put the softer, more serious, soul- and gospel-tinged side of his work in sharper focus. A tour followed, which yielded a live album that was also a success. This first period of solo popularity was interrupted by a combination of professional and personal conflicts; the Allman Brothers Band toured extensively and struggled to come up with a follow-up to Brothers and Sisters, and Gregg Allman began a relationship with Cher, the ex-wife and singing partner of Sonny Bono, which resulted in a tumultuous series of marriages and divorces for the two. These activities were played out amid Allman's well-publicized drug problems, which culminated with his testifying against a band employee in a federal drug case, which, in turn, led to the temporary but extended dissolution of the Allman Brothers Band.</p><p>Ironically, it was during this period, in 1977, that he delivered Playin' Up a Storm, a pop-soul effort that proved to be his most accomplished and successful album. Alas, this was to be the peak of his career away from the band. His next two albums, I'm No Angel and Just Before the Bullets Fly, released at the end of the 1980s, were quickly eclipsed by the re-formed and reinvigorated Allman Brothers Band's success on-stage and on record. His 1997 release Searchin' for Simplicity and the double-CD anthology One More Try had none of the urgency or success of the band's activities. In 2009, Australia's Raven Records imprint issued a 19-track, single-disc retrospective, entitled The Solo Years 1973-1997: One More Silver Dollar, that covered the whole of Allman's solo career to that date from his years at Capricorn and Columbia. In 2011, some 14 years after his last solo album, Allman released the T-Bone Burnett-produced Low Country Blues on Rounder Records.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>Given his place in the pantheon of American rock music, Gregg Allman's solo career away from the Allman Brothers Band has been generally disappointing. Perhaps that's why it took nearly a decade between his previous album, 1997's Searching for Simplicity (its title alone indicates his frustrations) and 1988's over-produced yet underwhelming Just Before the Bullets Fly. A whopping 14 years later, Allman joins forces with roots producer to the stars T-Bone Burnett, hoping that some of the latter's mojo can rub off on a singer who is one of the great white soul and blues vocalists in rock music. For the most part it does, as the duo choose 11 relatively obscure covers from classic artists such as Bobby ~Blue~ Bland, Junior Wells, and B.B. King that have clearly influenced Allman's musical approach. The backing is organic but far from stripped-down with horns, multiple guitars, and even background vocalists supporting the singer's patented crusty growl. From the opening raw thump of the ominous Sleepy John Estes' ~Floating Bridge~ to a peppy yet intense take on Muddy Waters' ~I Can't be Satisfied~ and a fiery reworking of Magic Sam's ~My Love Is Your Love,~ Allman sounds invested and inspired by this material and his musical surroundings.</p><p>Veterans such as Dr. John (credited here with his real name, Mac Rebennack), Doyle Bramhall II, and Burnett's often used rhythm section of drummer Jay Bellerose and Dennis Crouch on bass keep a taut yet easygoing lock on the groove. That's particularly evident on the predominantly acoustic version of Skip James' ~Devil Got My Woman.~ The horns that appear on five tunes never overpower the sound yet help propel Allman's soul-searing performance of Bland's ~Blind Man.~ Ditto for Otis Rush's slow blues ~Checking on My Baby,~ which brings the vocalist back to his ~Stormy Monday~-styled beginnings. One original co-written with Allman Brothers Band guitarist Warren Haynes, ~Just Another Rider,~ while not a terrible song, pales in comparison with the rest of the material and could have been saved for the next Brothers album, where it might make a better fit. Allman is credited with B-3 on the majority of the tunes, but his contributions are generally mixed so low as to be nearly inaudible. His organ can be heard on a low-down run-through of Amos Milburn's ~Tears, Tears, Tears~ that captures a sweet, jazzy noir West Coast blues. It adds up to Allman's best and surely most focused and cohesive solo release, and one where the template can hopefully be repeated in less time than it took this to appear.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Hal Horowitz</strong></p>"

The brainchild of whizzkid guitarist <b>Duane Allman</b>, the band initiated the 70s Southern rock boom that would result in R.E.M.'s world domination. They paid the price, but made some classic rock along the way. </p><p>Duane was born in Nashville on November 20, 1946, and soaked up the music of the South as his military family moved from state to state. When not tearing around Daytona Beach on his motorcycle, he studied B. B. King and Coltrane. The blond brothers Duane and Gregg (vocals/organ) hung with black musicians - a no-no in the segregated South - and formed the Allman Joys, Brit-invasion blues boomers with a Florida drawl. Gregg shot himself in the foot to avoid the draft and the band toured the garbage circuit before landing a deal with West Coast label Liberty.</p><p>As Hourglass they recorded two hopeless albums in 1968, and split. Gregg's whisky-soaked vocals gave him continued employment at Liberty, while Duane worked as a sideman at the Muscle Shoals studio in Alabama, coaxing from his bottleneck a battery of tones for anyone from Wilson Pickett to Delaney and Bonnie. When asked how he'd become so shit hot, he replied, 'Man, I took speed every night for three years and practised.' Otis Redding's manager Phil Walden came out of retirement to snap him up.</p><p>Duane preferred working off others to composing. He was searching for a new music in a wilderness of jamming. The Allman Brothers Band became his knights: Gregg, <b>Dickey Betts </b>(guitar/vocals), <b>Berry Oakley </b>(bass), <b>Butch Trucks </b>(drums) and Otis Redding's old drummer <b>Jaimoe Johanson</b> - Duane wanted two drummers to provide the muscle of James Brown's band. He got a spiritual brotherhood whose bond was such that each tattooed a mushroom to his ankle to reflect their taste for psychedelics. These good ole boys could turn the blues into a rainbow.</p><p>The pot of gold was at the end of every two-bit dive with a stage, and they played them all. Opportunity knocked when Bill Graham made them fixtures at his two Fillmore venues. They adopted Macon, Georgia, as their home, composing in the local graveyard. The Allmans' gumbo of jazzy improvisation and apocalyptic ballads respected their Delta roots, explored the hallucinogenic future, and made more sense the more you inhaled. They walked a razor edge, with Duane as an unhinged Aguirre, bullying and cajoling Gregg to greater songwriting heights.</p><p><a href=>The Allman Brothers Band</a>(1969) and <a href=>Idlewild South</a> (named after the Macon mansion the group shared) were as smooth as a cotton gin. Their real heart lay between the grooves of <a href=>The Allman Brothers At Fillmore East</a> (1971), a double LP dominated by the sweaty side-long mantra ~Whipping Post~. By 1970 they were <u>the</u> American band - a Dead unafraid to boogie. Duane sat in on Eric Clapton's <a href=>Layla</a>  (1970) sessions, too, and dominated the whole album. The great ~Layla~ riff and closing slide symphony were his, a tribute to Charlie Parker.</p><p>A motorcycle crash unplugged his amp in 1971, and a shattered Berry Oakley died in a similar accident a year later. The bereaved band remained on the road and attached to a drip-feed of drugs and nymphets, relying on an unruly Mafia of roadies (pictured on the back of the <b><i>Fillmore East</b></i> album) to keep them alive. One of their number, Twiggs Lyndon, slashed open a New York promoter who refused to pay them. </p><p>Gregg went from Duane's whipping post to a drug-filled punching bag, getting it together to record <b><i>Eat A Peach</b></i>- a grab-bag of new and live tunes featuring Duane. ~Mountain Jam~, his variations on a theme by Donovan, took up an entire disc. The Allmans still had the courage to make a sterling album like <b><i>Brothers And Sisters (1973)</b></i>, but they also made do with slop like <b><i>Win, Lose Or Draw (1975)</b></i>. Live, they still smoked - with <b>Chuck Leavell </b>(piano) replacing Duane - and played to 600,000 people at the 1973 Watkins Glen Summer Jam.</p><p>Betts took over the songwriting. His ~Rambling Man~ reached #2 in the US that year and kept the band afloat and poppy. Manager Walden also ran their Capricorn record company, and screwed them out of royalties. Endless touring paid the bills. But Jaimoe's jazz leanings pissed off the conservative Betts. Ructions formed.</p><p>Tired of the view from a Greyhound bus, Gregg fled to LA and married Cher in 1975. The marriage broke up pretty well instantly when he started demanding she call him 'Mr Allman' - when he was around, that is, because Gregg could disappear for days, searching out his next fix. Fans got their kicks from the smelly hill-billyisms of Lynyrd Skynyrd, while lame solo projects like Gregg's <i>Playin' Up A Storm</i>, <b>Dickey Betts And Great Southern</b>, and Leavell and Jaimoe's <a href=>Sea Level</a> filled the bargain bins.</p><p>The final straw came in 1976 when Gregg testified against his personal pusher Scooter Herring, in return for amnesty. That Herring had saved him once from OD'ing meant less than going to jail. The band now barely spoke to each other, but let Gregg know that he might as well have loosened the screws on Duane's Harley. The fans were similarly disgusted, although they still turn out in their Stars'n'Bars-bedecked droves for the frequent cash-register-ringing 'reunions' that end with one or more members storming off stage midset. </p><p>Record sales, if not fraternity, got them inducted into the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame. It was recognition that, in 1970, the Allmans handed the South their pride and musical heritage, while reaching heights many other bands only dreamed of (stand up, Black Oak Arkansas). Losing their most inspiring members was their Gettysburg, and they have toured with the looks of ghosts and the grudge of the defeated ever since.</p>&mdash; <b>Charles Bottomley</b>",

				"review": "<p>Ninety-one minutes of the Allman Brothers Band in concert from a Cincinnati venue that they loved, nearly a year before their legendary Fillmore shows. The acoustics are good, though a little shaky -- the tape was made at 7 ½ ips, the bare minimum professional standard, which leaves more hiss than one might like, and a bit less clarity than a fully professional live album might show; on the other hand, the group's sound imparts its own punch and clarity, and it was done in stereo, and if not for the existence of the Fillmore tapes, and the fact that the albums they yielded sold a kajillion copies, this show might well have been released in the 1970s. It isn't as intense as the Fillmore shows, but it does capture the group as a little known working band with but a single album out and building a reputation -- and with Dickey Betts yet to emerge as either a singer or composer, and their sound still being worked out (~Statesboro Blues~ gets a startlingly subdued performance, anticipating the acoustic version of ~In Memory of Elizabeth Reed~ from the the '90s recording' 2nd Set). They build their set on ambitious reinterpretations of songs by Blind Willie McTell, Muddy Waters (~Trouble In Mind~), John Lee Hooker (~Dimples~), and Willie Dixon, whose ~Hoochie Coochie Man~ is a soaring highlight of this two-disc set, in a version that makes every other white band's cover seem wimpy by comparison, climaxing with a searing, though somewhat disjointed 44-minute version of ~Mountain Jam.~</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Whereas most great live rock albums are about energy, At Fillmore East is like a great live jazz session, where the pleasure comes from the musicians' interaction and playing. The great thing about that is, the original album that brought the Allmans so much acclaim is as notable for its clever studio editing as it is for its performances. Producer Tom Dowd skillfully trimmed some of the performances down to relatively concise running time (edits later restored on the double-disc set The Fillmore Concerts), at times condensing several performances into one track. Far from being a sacrilege, this tactic helps present the Allmans in their best light, since even if the music isn't necessarily concise (three tracks run over ten minutes, with two in the 20-minute range), it does showcase the group's terrific instrumental interplay, letting each member (but particularly guitarist Duane and keyboardist/vocalist Gregg) shine. Even after the release of the unedited concerts, this original double album remains the pinnacle of the Allmans and Southern rock at its most elastic, bluesy, and jazzy.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<P>When rhythm and blues met country and put on a white face in the mid 1950s, rock and roll was born and the new genre soon displaced jazz as the dominant popular music in American culture. Though it has suffered periodic lulls in the years since, especially recently, rock and roll must be considered the popular music of the second half of the twentieth century. And as such, rock and roll has been an integral part of American culture during that time. It emerged as the music of young America and has remained linked to that age group ever since. Through the years, young Americans have adopted the image of the music they listen to: the greasers of the 50s, the mop-tops of the early 60s, the hippies of the late 60s and early 70s, the punks of the late 70s, the metalheads of the 70s and 80s, and the grunge rockers of the 90s. </P><P>Yet, while Americans Little Richard, Elvis Presley, and Jerry Lee Lewis led the infancy of rock and roll, it was England that produced the first great and most influential bands of the genre: The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Led Zeppelin. Even the Jimi Hendrix Experience was two-thirds British, and the American born Hendrix needed to cross the Atlantic to get his start. </P><P>So while Americans like Bob Dylan and James Brown remain icons of rock and roll, they were basically one-man shows. No matter how talented their backing bands were, the frontman remained the focus and the star. Yet, music, especially American music, has always functioned best as a collective effort. From Dixieland to Big Band to Bluegrass to Bebop, it has always been the combination of the interplay of the group and the artistry of the soloist that has made music special. Look no further than Miles Davis' great sextet, responsible for Kind of Blue - quite possibly the finest album of any genre ever recorded. This group not only featured the incomparable Davis, but the legendary John Coltrane on tenor saxophone and the great Julian ~Cannonball~ Adderly on alto sax, backed by the world class rhythm section of pianist Bill Evans, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Jimmy Cobb. And still, it wasn't merely the incredible skill of any of these six individuals that make the album so magical, but rather the way that they as group work together. </P><P>When then would America produce its top-notch rock and roll band? Brian Wilson was an absolute genius, and Pet Sounds remains one of the best albums ever, but by the time the Beach Boys finally gained their freedom from Murray Wilson and their record executives, Brian Wilson was too unstable mentally for the band realize their full potential. 1966 saw the emergence of both The Doors and The Grateful Dead, both formidable bands and rock legends. But the former's career was too short and tumultuous, the latter more concerned with touring and too closely identified with their subculture to make a huge impact all at once. </P><P>In March 1969, a band came together in northern Florida that is worthy of the label as America's first great rock band. Guitarist Duane Allman joined up with his brother Gregg (vocals and Hammond B3), bassist Berry Oakley, drummers Jai Johnny Johanson (Jaimoe) and Butch Trucks and guitarist Dickey Betts to form the Allman Brothers Band. These six men came from musical roots as diverse as American culture itself: Duane was fresh off a year long stint as the lead guitarist in the Muscle Shoals house band, where he worked with some of the finest soul acts in the country, Wilson Pickett and Aretha Franklin amongst them. Gregg had played in rock and blues bands since his teenage years, and was a big fan of soul and r&amp;b. Jaimoe was a huge jazz fan and had toured as part of the backing bands of both Otis Redding and Percy Sledge. Trucks had been in folk bands and was a member of a symphony orchestra. Betts came from a background rich in country and bluegrass, and was proficient on both the mandolin and banjo before he even picked up a guitar. Oakley was a native of Chicago, the place to which both jazz and blues flowed from the south and then to the rest of the nation. All these various forms of American music would come together to make this American rock band. </P><P>But it was that last form of music, the blues, which was the foundation that this band was built upon. The blues was the first form of music that could be called indigenous to this country and since emerging during slave times, it has been the river that has fed all the tributaries of American music. Granted, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, and even Cream were blues bands at their very core. But these were British bands offering a British interpretation of American music. The members of the Allman Brothers Band were from the land where the blues began and their rock and roll take on the blues would be one of their hallmarks as a group - and one of the more interesting things ever offered by an American band. <BR><BR>There is another element characteristic of American music to be considered. While the majority of the music of the rest of Western culture (read: European Classical) relies on form and technical perfection, American music has its roots in Africa. The blues, jazz, and gospel, all these forms of American music grew out of the African-American culture in the south, and as such reflect an African perspective on music much more than a European one. And in the African culture it isn't musical perfection that matters; it's musical expression; it's ~soul~. Conveying one's emotions is paramount.</P><P>Consequently, American music lends itself more to improvisation because no one feels the same all of the time. In order for the musician to convey his or her emotions at any given time, the song must necessarily vary. A certain amount of improvisation must enter the equation. This is why American music, from jazz on down to rock and roll has always lent itself to being a live art - best experienced in person rather than via a recording because each live performance gives birth to a new creation. </P><P>And it was these two characteristics that marked the early career of the Allman Brothers Band. The band toured incessantly, pulling close to three hundred live dates a year. On most Sundays they played free concerts in Atlanta's Piedmont Park. They played the now legendary Atlanta Pop Festival on Fourth of July Weekend in 1970. Bill Graham, probably the most famous promoter in the history of rock and roll, booked them for multiple dates at both his New York and San Francisco venues. The band was gaining a reputation as one of the premier touring bands in the country. </P><P>Every Allman Brothers' show featured their takes on a number of blues classics. Their self-titled 1969 album featured a cover of Muddy Waters' ~Trouble No More~ and 1970's Idlewild South had a cover of Willie Dixon's ~Hoochie Coochie Man~. Yet despite their touring reputation, neither album sold exceptionally well. A studio recording just couldn't capture the essence of this band. They were a live act, and the dynamic between the members as they improvised, and the interplay between band and audience was where the magic happened. </P><P>The band was aware of it: ~The stage is our natural element. We kind of get frustrated doing the records, so consequently our next album will be for the most part a live recording to get some of that natural fire on it~ , Duane said shortly before their third album was recorded. The band's manager and head of their Capricorn record label, Phil Walden agreed with the live album notion. Graham's Fillmore East in New York City was the chosen site for the weekend of March 12th and 13th, 1971. </P><P>Two shows would be played each night and renowned producer Tom Dowd, who produced Idlewild South and previously worked with John Coltrane, Aretha Franklin, Cream and numerous other legends, was brought in to oversee the recording. </P><P>The four shows yielded Live At Fillmore East, considered by many to be the finest live album of all time. At the time of its release in July 1971, Rolling Stone claimed ~Any comparison to anybody is fatuous~ and called the band ~the best damn rock 'n' roll band this country has produced in the past five years~ . The improvisational nature of the content necessitated it being released as a double LP. Walden was met with opposition by Atlantic, in charge of Capricorn's distribution. But Walden was able to change their mind: ~I informed them that we had this brilliant marketing scheme that we wanted to sell it for $6.98 because we were trying to project this image of The Allmans as sort of the people's band~. </P><P>1972's follow up, Eat a Peach, contained three additional live tracks that didn't make the cut for LAFE. In 1992, the seven tracks from LAFE were combined with those from Eat a Peach and two tracks of bonus material to create to double CD The Fillmore Concerts. It is this album that the Smithsonian should include as a defining cultural text. The Fillmore Concerts represents The Allman Brothers Band at their best, and consequently best represents an American band making American music. </P><P>Of the twelve songs on the album, six are old blues classics stamped with the Allmans' harder, eclectic seal. Following Bill Graham's famous ~OK, The Allman Brothers Band~ introduction, Blind Willie McTell's ~Statesboro Blues~ opens the album. It contains some excellent slide work from Duane Allman. The slide had long been part of the blues, as blues guitarists used it to more closely emulate the human voice with their instrument. But it was Allman who popularized it as part of rock and roll. Though a few other rock guitarists had used it before him, none did so as often nor half as well as Allman. Allen Woody, who played in the ABB in later years, once said, ~George Harrison started playing slide after that Fillmore album came out. Eric [Clapton] was playing more slide, and where did [they] get it? From Duane. Duane is probably single-handedly responsible for most of the guys in England, later that played any slide~. </P><P>But it wasn't just the Country Blues of McTell that were featured. There's the Chicago Blues with Muddy Waters' ~Trouble No More~, Sonny Boy Williamson's ~One Way Out~, and Willie Cobbs' ~You Don't Love Me~. The Delta Blues are represented by Elmore James' ~Done Somebody Wrong~. There's also the Texas Blues with T-Bone Walker's ~Stormy Monday~. The album does a good job of illustrating the various styles of America's seminal music. </P><P>But The Fillmore Concerts doesn't rely totally on the material of others; there's also plenty of original material. Dickey Betts' ~In Memory of Elizabeth Reed~ is amongst it. At this stage in the band's development, Betts was not yet the driving force that he would become. This song represents one of his first written contributions to the band. Most likely rock and roll's premier author of instrumentals, ~Elizabeth Reed~ represents Betts' first, and probably best, foray into that area. </P><P>Yet, ~Elizabeth Reed~ isn't entirely a rock and roll song. Betts has long admitted that there is a distinct Latin flavor to it. It also features the trademark dual lead guitars of Betts and Allman. The harmonizing guitars bring to mind the work Miles Davis did with John Coltrane and later, Wayne Shorter - all three big influences on the ABB. ~We used our guitars like a brass section, playing all these harmony lines. Harmonies that sounded like they took a month to write were actually improvised~ , Betts said. </P><P>However, Betts also contends ~Western swing bands from the '30's always used that twin-harmony guitar, and a lot of the songs we did were influenced by that~ . Wherever the influence came from (probably some combination of both), this song reflects several of the various elements that make up both American music and the music of the Allman Brothers Band. The dual lead, something not really seen in rock and roll before the ABB would later be used by both Lynyrd Skynyrd and The Eagles - two other heavyweight American bands. </P><P>The importance of this song doesn't end there. It also features a solo by the dual drummers of Butch Trucks and Jaimoe - the type of solo that not many rock bands before or since have utilized. Further, the version of ~Elizabeth Reed~ that appears on The Fillmore Concerts is a combination of the late and early performances from March 13th. When the compilation album was released in 1992, producer Tom Dowd wasn't working under the time constraints he was in 1971. After listening to the master tapes of three times the song was performed in the four shows, Dowd felt this hybrid version best reflected what the band was capable of. Dowd's work in this case, and with much of the rest of 1992 album, illustrates the importance the producer has in the album making process - whether the album be a studio or a live recording. Dowd is certainly a producer in the lineage of Phil Spector, though the bands Dowd dealt with were by no means interchangeable or unimportant parts as they were with Spector. </P><P>Still, the greatness of this album goes beyond styles and production and influence. Viewed simply as a musical offering, it's absolutely jaw dropping. ~One Way Out~ shows Dickey Betts really coming into his own, ready to step out of Duane's shadow. His solo on this piece is his best work on the album. But it is the bass playing of Berry Oakley that really drives the song. Current Allman Brothers Band manager Burt Holman refers to Oakley as ~a bass player who thought he was playing guitar~ . And it's that aspect of his playing that propels this song. That characteristic has been a trademark of all of the five men to play bass for the Allman Brothers in their thirty-three year history. </P><P>At the same time, some credit must go to the drummers for allowing this to happen. Inspired by James Brown's band, Duane Allman wanted two drummers from day one, and with two drummers, the rhythm section is much beefier, freeing up the bassist to be more melodic. There aren't many other bassists who can do what Berry Oakley did on this song. </P><P>~One Way Out~ also features another important aspect of American music: call and response. After Betts takes the first solo, the band breaks it down, and Betts and Duane Allman alternate four bar phrases, taking two apiece, as the solo baton is passed from one Les Paul to the other. Call and response had long been a part of American music, back through jazz and blues, but those 16 bars are the best example of it in American rock and roll. </P><P>Lastly, it should be noted that ~One Way Out~ is different from all the other songs on the album because it was not culled from the March 12th and 13th performances. Though the song was played those nights, when it was decided that a version of ~One Way Out~ would be included on Eat A Peach, Dowd thought the best version was from June 27, 1971 - an historic date in rock and roll history. Bill Graham had decided that the Fillmore East had run its course and decided to close it at the height of its popularity. The band he chose to be the last act ever to play the theater - none other than The Allman Brothers Band, who played from the early morning hours until sunrise in one of rock and roll's most fabled concerts. </P><P>~Stormy Monday~ features an incredible solo from Gregg Allman. While his primary role in the band is as a growling, bluesy vocalist, this song shows that Gregg is no slouch on the Hammond B3 either. The sound of that organ is as much a part of the Allman Brothers sound as the dual lead guitars, and Allman's proficiency here makes it hard to believe that just two years prior he had never once played the instrument. While Al Kooper's B3 work may have propelled Dylan's ~Like a Rolling Stone~; it was Allman and The Doors' Ray Manzarek who integrated the B3 as regular part of rock and roll music. </P><P>The most incredible solo of the album however comes from Duane on ~You Don't Love Me~. The basic structure of the song wraps up at the seven minute mark, at which point, Duane simply takes off, soloing for an additional twelve minutes! Often on his own, sometimes with the band backing him, Duane gives one of the most inspirational and well respected solos in rock and roll history, rendering the audience in an awe-inspired hush. At one point someone in the audience yells out above the silence ~Play all night!~ in what has since become one of the most famous audience captures ever. Years later, jazz critic Robert Palmer would say Duane was ~the only 'rock' guitarist I had heard up to that point who could solo on a one-chord vamp for as long as half an hour or more and not only avoid boring you but keep you absolutely riveted~ . That's exactly what he does here, leaving no doubt that he was indeed one of rock and roll's all-time greatest guitarists. The legendary Jerry Wexler says of him ~I never heard a guitarist I found as satisfying as Duane~. </P><P>Duane finishes his solo by quoting a phrase from ~Joy to the World~. Though he probably wasn't mindful of it at the time, in doing so, he gave a nod to another important an element of American music: the African-American Church, which was invaluable in the contributions it made in shaping rock and roll music. </P><P>Yet, for all that individual mastery on disc one, disc two has more to offer, for it is there that the band best functions as a tight, cohesive unit - six men playing as one. ~Hot 'Lanta~, an instrumental with writing credits given to all six members of the band, opens the disc. Another song propelled by the thumping bass of Oakley, ~Hot 'Lanta~, features tight, single-minded rhythmic backing as each member is afforded a chance to solo and again showcases the trademark dual lead of Duane and Dickey. </P><P>But, what makes The Fillmore Concerts the definitive representation of March 12th and 13th, 1971 is the ~Whipping Post~ à ~Mountain Jam~ sequence. Previously, these two songs had been split between Live At Fillmore East and Eat A Peach respectively, but one listen to The Fillmore Concerts convinces anyone that these two songs were meant to be heard together. As ~Whipping Post~ ends on LAFE, one can hear Butch Trucks flashing the skills he gained during his time in the Jacksonville Symphonette, as his tympanis usher in ~Mountain Jam~. But it is only on The Fillmore Concerts can the two be heard as they were meant to be - together, just as they were during the final show on March 13, 1971. </P><P><BR>What further makes these two songs so special is that together they show the full improvisational skill of this band at the height of their powers. Improvisation has always been a part of American music, back to its jazz and Dixieland roots, and it was always a staple of the Allman Brothers Band's arsenal - that is why they are best represented by a live album. Their work on these two tracks is proof that quality group improvisation is not reserved for jazz bands. The music here ranges from the sublime to the ethereal. </P><P>How abundant is the improvisation in these two tracks? The studio version of ~Whipping Post~ clocked in at 5:16 on the band's eponymously titled debut, but is stretched to 22:37 here. Meanwhile, ~Mountain Jam~ is 33:47 long, and grew out of a previous late night jam session with members of the Grateful Dead as they collectively improvised on Donovan's two minute and thirty-four second long ~There is a Mountain~. </P><P>Like ~Hot 'Lanta~, both of these songs afford each member of the band a solo, including the drummers. Each solo is indicative of the unbelievable skill of its author - ~We have rough arrangements, layouts of the songs, and then the solos are entirely up to each member of the band~ , Duane said before the recording took place. Towards the end of ~Whipping Post~, Dickey begins playing a few lines of ~Frere Jacques~, which Duane soon picks up on and harmonizes along to, thus illustrating that good ears, not good chops, are the key to being a great player in an improvisational band. In such an environment, the most important thing a musician can do is listen to what his bandmates are doing, rather than focusing only on himself. </P><P>~Frere Jacques~ isn't the only song to be teased in this sequence. Two-thirds of the way through ~Mountain Jam~, as the whole band joins back in following the bass solo, they tease Hendrix' ~3rd Stone from the Sun~, a song that to this day remains heavily teased by bands of the Allmans' ilk. Five minutes later, Duane teases ~Amazing Grace~, further illustrating the importance that the African-American Church has had in the development of American music. </P><P>Earlier on in ~Mountain Jam~, Duane uses his slide to make bird-like noises, reminiscent of the work he had done the previous year on Derek and The Dominoes Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. </P><P>However, the improvisation heard in these songs is not the ~noodlish~ drivel that plagues many of the bands to follow in the Allmans' footsteps. In fact, it is much to the contrary. Dickey Betts' solo on ~Whipping Post~ yielded the melody that would become ~Les Brers in A minor~ - Betts' second instrumental which would appear on the band's next album, Eat A Peach. Jimmy Guterman puts it best in the liner notes to The Fillmore Concerts: In other hands, the idea of extended jams that the Allman Brothers Band perfected during their early-Seventies heyday has deteriorated into long-winded show-off exercises. But one can't blame the Allmans for that; it's not their fault that their imitators turned out to be far less inspired, that few could replicate their devotion to the blues and their determination to burn their own trail. It's worth remembering how lively and unprecedented these explorations were, especially the versions in this set, and how free-from once really stood for freedom in music, not lazy anarchy. </P><P>Still, if one were to cast aside all the group and individual excellence and were also to ignore all the representations of the roots of American rock and roll this album would still stand as Smithsonian-worthy because it epitomizes an era of American music, a bygone era - The Golden Age of Rock and Roll. From roughly 1966 to 1973, rock and roll was on top of the world, and saw an unprecedented run of creativity, ingenuity, and greatness. The Beatles moved from bubble-gum-pop to the some of the most innovative music ever created. The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin reintroduced the blues to the mainstream in a whole new light. Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix revolutionized the use of electric guitar. The Grateful Dead and The Jefferson Airplane led the summer of love. Woodstock took place. But by the mid-1970s it was gone, replaced by disco, and meaningless glam, arena, and stadium rock. </P><P>But The Fillmore Concerts is a perfect representation of this Golden Age. It truly captures what a music fan could experience at the Fillmore East, or San Francisco's Fillmore or Avalon Ballroom on any given night during this time. It is the same thing that existed at Woodstock, at Monterrey, at Atlanta and Isle of Wight. It is the same spirit that the Allman Brothers Band, The Grateful Dead, and The Band brought to Watkins Glen in the summer of 1973. The time was ripe for this kind of music. Dickey Betts said, ~We did everything we could against being commercial… It was musical telepathy. We were into individual expression. We were also lucky that the times were right for free thinkers. It was a free period~ . And The Fillmore Concerts captures this happening at its zenith. Bill Graham's associate, Alan Arkush, who saw innumerable shows at the Fillmore East calls those March shows ~one of the greatest live performances I ever witnessed~. </P><P>As the album was recorded, Hendrix and Janis Joplin had been dead for half a year, and Jim Morrison and Ron ~Pigpen~ McKernan were to follow soon. The very theater where the album was recorded was only to survive another three and a half months. The age was slipping by fast, but somehow, this album provides a perfect two hour and twelve minute long snapshot of it. </P><P>For example, the practice of ~sitting in~. In this era, there was a real fraternity between musicians, and is evidenced on The Fillmore Concerts. Saxophonist Rudolph ~Juicy~ Carter guests on ~Hot 'Lanta~. Longtime friend on the band Thom Doucette adds harmonica to four tracks. Even more, Elvin Bishop, who shared the bill with the Allmans that weekend, his pianist Steve Miller, and percussionist Bobby Caldwell, join the band to perform Bishop's ~Drunken Hearted Boy~ as an encore to ~Whipping Post~ à ~Mountain Jam~ to close out the album. The song's 12-bar blues structure, the same basic structure that has been the backbone of every form of original American music ever created, makes it easy for all nine musicians involved to easily tear through the number. </P><P>As the song finishes, the crowd screams for more, to which Duane playfully retorts ~That's all for tonight, thank you. Hey listen, it's six o'clock. Y'all look here. We recorded all this, this is gonna be our third album. You're all on it. We ain't gonna send you no check, but thanks~. Still the last audible sound on the track is the same audience that earlier pleaded ~Play all night!~ still screaming out ~More!~. That type of playful and inspired interaction between performer and audience just doesn't exist anymore. </P><P>Even the original album's cover represents the feeling of camaraderie that existed at that time, especially within this band. While the front of the album featured the band seated in front of the venue, the other side of the album jacket pictured the band's road crew in a similar pose. They truly were the Brotherhood that they claimed to be. How many other bands would feature their road crew on the album cover? But then, how many other bands had a crew that boasted characters such as the Legendary Red Dog, Joseph Campbell (who would be the inspiration for a character of the same name in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous) and the late Joe Dan Petty (who would go on to form the band Grinderswitch). </P><P>For The Allman Brothers Band as a unit, this album is their crowning achievement. It represents the original line-up at their peak. Just seven and a half months after it was recorded, and shortly after it was certified as their first gold record, Duane, the band's founder, leader, inspiration, and greatest talent, was tragically killed in motorcycle accident in the band's adopted hometown of Macon, GA. Eerily, Berry Oakley would suffer the same fate just a year later, only two blocks from the site of Duane's accident. </P><P>The two horrible tragedies were only the beginning, as more death, obscene amounts of drugs, constant in-fighting, and bitter contract squabbles with management would mar the band's future. But none of that can ever take away from the brilliance and importance of this band and this album. It was on the single-handed strength of this album that Capricorn established itself as a viable record label. It was because of its success that the so-called ~southern rock~ genre was able to develop and become a legitimate movement throughout the seventies. Without the Allman Brothers Band and The Fillmore Concerts there would have been no Lynyrd Skynyrd, no Marshall Tucker Band. This was also the first highly successful live album. Without it, there would be no Frampton Comes Alive, no Waiting for Columbus, no Live Rust. </P><P><BR>The Allman Brothers Band was America's first great rock band. While they were not and could not be an answer to the Beatles, they were an answer to the Rolling Stones and to Led Zeppelin. ~These players were grounded in the blues in a much more significant, intimate, and real way than British bands,~ said Atlantic Records' head and rock legend Jerry Wexler. And they were. They were an American band, playing American music from the place where it and rock and roll was born - the American South. Their then manager, Phil Walden, called them ~Southerners, living in the South, playing Southern music~ . That much is true, but it came from a man who made his living pushing the ~southern rock~ genre. As Gregg Allman once said, ~Rock and roll was born in the South; saying southern rock is like saying rock-rock~ . Pigeonholing this band as ~southern rockers~ does them a disservice; they were infinitely more than that. </P><P>And it should not go without mentioning that they were an integrated band from the American south - no small accomplishment for a band from that area. While The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Sly and the Family Stone may have been integrated before the emergence of the Allman Brothers Band, one came from a more accepting England, the other from the grossly liberal Bay Area. Neither came from the racially charged South at the height of the civil rights movement and racial tension. </P><P>The Allman Brothers Band had seemingly all the roots and influences of all the varied ingredients of American music, and The Fillmore Concerts is the best of example of them displaying those very influences, as well as their incredible musical skill. The album captures a slice of American life, and more importantly American music, that unfortunately no longer exists. When producer Tom Dowd spoke of the remastering process he used for the 1992 release he said ~Now that we've got the original 16-track tapes preserved on digital, we can send the 16-track to the Smithsonian~ . Whether Dowd meant it or not, those tapes, and this album, are certainly deserving of that honor. </P><P>— <B>Matt Bouffard</B></P>"

For years, make that decades, they have been inundated with reissues of the same material with teasers thrown in, or have been given truly bizarre compilations such as the Madacy ripoff entitled Essential, which didn't include many of the band's biggest hits and on its second disc provided a straight reissue of Enlightened Rogues. The Deluxe Edition of Eat a Peach is something different, however. For those who have been in the depths of confusion about the various Fillmore East reissues — whether the straight At Fillmore East album or the Fillmore Concerts set — this version of Eat a Peach, fully and beautifully remastered, does hold a bit of a treasure trove, though the word is that the second disc has been oft bootlegged. While the album is on disc one, in all its pieces and in proper order, disc two stands as a virtually unreleased concert of the ABB's final performance at the Fillmore on June 27, 1971 — with Duane, who was killed in October of that year. Two of the disc's tracks had been previously released — ~Midnight Rider~ (on Duane Allman Anthology, Vol. 2) and ~One Way Out~ (on the original Eat a Peach, which means the track shows up on both discs here). The rest of these performances — ~Statesboro Blues,~ ~Don't Keep Me Wonderin',~ ~Done Somebody Wrong,~ ~In Memory of Elizabeth Reed~ (12:51 in length), ~Hot 'Lanta,~ ~Whipping Post~ (20:17 in length), and ~You Don't Love Me~ (clocking in at a whopping 17:24) — have never been officially released. Sure, it's a standard Allman Brothers set — if there ever was a such a thing. The playing is very inspired and adventurous, Gregg's singing is better than on the original Fillmore dates, and the interplay between Duane and Dickey Betts is symbiotic. And it rocks like a mother. Real fans of the original band have something to be happy about for a change, as this hidden bit of Allman memorabilia with the beloved Duane is finally on the shelves — it might have been nice if Universal had issued the second disc as its own album so you didn't have to buy Eat a Peach again, but oh well.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b></p>"

		"biography": "<p>Formed: 1974, Memphis, TN<br>Disbanded:  1981</p><p>A mainstream country-rock band similar in execution (if not commercial success) to the Eagles, the Amazing Rhythm Aces were formed in Memphis in 1974 by bassist Jeff Davis and drummer Butch McDade, who had earlier recorded and toured with the great singer/songwriter Jesse Winchester. After striking out on their own, Davis and McDade enlisted vocalist/guitarist Russell Smith, keyboardist Billy Earhart III, dobro player Barry Burton, and pianist James Hooker to develop a sound composed of equal parts pop, country and blue-eyed soul.<p>Stacked Deck, the Amazing Rhythm Aces debut album, appeared in 1975; it produced two significant crossover hits, ~Third Rate Romance~ and ~Amazing Grace (Used to Be Her Favorite Song),~ the group's lone Top Ten country single. A year later, the hit ~The End Is Not in Sight (The Cowboy Tune),~ from the LP Too Stuffed to Jump, won the Aces a Grammy for Country Vocal Performance by a Group. Following the release of 1977's Toucan Do It Too, Burton left the group, and was replaced by Duncan Cameron.<p>In 1978, the Aces released Burning the Ballroom Down, followed a year later by a self-titled effort featuring cameos by Joan Baez, Tracy Nelson and the Muscle Shoals Horns; both were met with critical approval, but sold poorly. They released one final record, How the Hell Do You Spell Rhythum, before disbanding. While Smith went on to become a successful songwriter, Earhart joined Hank Williams, Jr.'s Bama Band, and Cameron joined Sawyer Brown--a group which, ironically enough, would find significant chart success in the 1980s with a sound similar to what the Amazing Rhythm Aces had created a decade earlier.</p><p>After a hiatus of some 15 years, the Aces reformed in 1994. The group, now   comprised of Smith, Davis, McDade, Earhart, Hooker and new guitarist/mandolinist   Danny Parks, marked their return to duty by releasing Born Again, a collection   of newly-recorded renditions of their biggest hits. In addition, they also began   composing new songs for a projected comeback album, although McDade's cancer-related   death on November 29, 1998 left the Aces' continued existence in doubt.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jason Ankeny, All-Music Guide </strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>In contrast to such '70s country-rock outfits as the Eagles and Poco, whose members had passed through the West Coast folk-rock scene dominated by the Byrds, the Amazing Rhythm Aces were a Memphis-based band. Their debut album is an edgy effort, rooted in a purer Southern sound, and embracing a soulfulness that their West Coast rivals lacked. The country gospel tune ~Life's Railway to Heaven,~ the funky ~The 'Ella B',~ the stomping ~Hit the Nail on the Head,~ and the soulful ~The Beautiful Lie~ would never have been done in as raw, intense, or bracing a fashion by their rivals. Russell Smith brings a vocal performance to Charlie Rich's ~Who Will the Next Fool Be~ that sounds like he's channeling the ghost of Sam Cooke. And between those album highlights and the hits ~Third Rate Romance~ and ~Amazing Grace (Used to Be Her Favorite Song),~ the group works in a sweetly nostalgic piece called ~King of the Cowboys,~ all about movie and television heroes.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

		"lastname": "Amos",
		"name": "Tori Amos",
		"biography": "<p>Tori Amos (born Myra Ellen Amos) was one of several female singer/songwriters who combined the stark, lyrical attack of alternative rock with a distinctly '70s musical approach, creating music that fell between the orchestrated meditations of Kate Bush and the stripped-down poetics of Joni Mitchell. In addition, she revived the singer/songwriter traditions of the '70s while re-establishing the piano as a rock & roll instrument. With her 1992 album Little Earthquakes, Amos built a dedicated following that expanded with her second album, Under the Pink, before giving way to a decade-spanning legacy.</p><p>The daughter of a Methodist preacher, Amos was born in North Carolina but raised in Maryland. She began singing and playing piano in the church choir at the age of four, and songwriting followed shortly afterward. Amos proved to be a quick learner, and her instrumental prowess earned her a scholarship to the preparatory school at Baltimore's Peabody Conservatory. While studying at Peabody, she became infatuated with rock & roll, particularly the music of Led Zeppelin. She lost her scholarship at the age of 11 -- quite possibly due to her interest in popular music -- but continued writing songs nevertheless, eventually moving to Los Angeles in her late teens to become a pop singer. Atlantic Records signed her in 1987, and Amos recorded an uninspired pop-metal album called Y Kant Tori Read the following year. The record was a complete failure, attracting no attention from radio or press and selling very few copies; nevertheless, she didn't lose her record contract. By 1990, Amos had adopted a new approach, singing spare, haunting, semi-confessional piano ballads that were arranged like Kate Bush but had the melodies and lyrical approach of Joni Mitchell. Atlantic sponsored a trip to England in 1991, where she played a series of concerts in support of an EP, Me and a Gun.</p><p>The harrowing ~Me and a Gun~ was an autobiographical song, telling the tale of Amos' own experience with rape. It gained positive reviews throughout the media, and both the EP and the supporting concerts sold well. Little Earthquakes, Amos' first album as a singer/songwriter, was released in 1992 and fared well in both the U.S. and the U.K. The same year, she released the Crucify EP, which featured cover songs like Nirvana's ~Smells Like Teen Spirit~ and Led Zeppelin's ~Thank You.~ Delivered in early 1994, Under the Pink, the proper follow-up to Little Earthquakes, was an even bigger hit, selling over a million copies and launching the minor hit singles ~God~ and ~Cornflake Girl.~ Two years later, Amos delivered her third album, Boys for Pele, her most ambitious and difficult record to date. The album debuted at number two and quickly went platinum.</p><p>Amos spent much of 1997 dealing with personal matters, including a miscarriage and a marriage. She also worked on her fourth album, From the Choirgirl Hotel, which was released in the spring of 1998. The two-disc To Venus and Back followed in 1999 to coincide with a tour with Alanis Morissette. In 2001, Amos returned with the covers album Strange Little Girls, which also marked her last release for Atlantic.</p><p>The next year, she found a new label home with Epic and followed with Scarlet's Walk in October. Her eighth studio album, an autobiographical record titled The Beekeeper, was released in 2005. The massive five-disc Piano collection arrived in 2006, boasting a cornucopia of album cuts, B-sides, unedited and alternate versions, demos, and seven previously unissued tracks, followed by the typically eclectic and hard-rocking American Doll Posse in 2007, an all-new collection of songs that found the artist assuming five archetypal personalities, all of whom were based on feminine gods in Greek and Roman mythology.</p><p>As she toured in support of the album, Amos released live digital recordings of each concert as part of the Legs and Boots concert series, which grew to encompass 27 albums. Although each release was made available via iTunes and other online vendors, Amos also released a ~best-of~ Legs and Boots compilation in March 2009, having created its track list from various recordings during the tour. Meanwhile, she also focused on new material that had been written during the tour, which she soon compiled into her tenth studio album. Entitled Abnormally Attracted to Sin, the album was released in May 2009 by Universal Republic, Amos' new record label. A holiday album, Midwinter Graces, followed closely behind, appearing before the end of 2009 and garnering warm reviews.</p><p>In the summer of 2011, Amos began touring in advance of her next album, the classically based song cycle Night of Hunters. A conceptual work based on familiar motifs by composers Satie, Chopin, Schubert, and Bach, Amos' recording centered on a couple torn apart by life's difficulties and monotonies, and the female protagonist's journey to find wholeness within herself. Amos collaborated on the recording with the string quartet Apollon Musagete, arranger John Philip Shenale, and clarinetist Ernst Ottensamer. Night of Hunters was released by the classical label Deutsche Grammophon in September of 2011; it peaked at 24 on the Billboard 200. Amos' next move was to re-record some of her songs, newly arranged by John Philip Shenale with the Metropole Orchestra. The resulting set, called Gold Dust, appeared almost exactly a year after Night of Hunters; it debuted at 63 on the Billboard 200. In 2013, after several years in gestation, the musical The Light Princess, based on the fairy tale by Scottish seminal fantasy writer George MacDonald and with music and lyrics by Amos, premiered at the National Theatre in London to wild critical acclaim and was nominated for best musical in the prestigious Evening Standard Theatre Awards. The following year, Amos announced her return to pop with her fourteenth studio album, Unrepentant Geraldines. Heavily inspired by her love of fine art, in particular the work of outsider photographer Diane Arbus, the album was scheduled for release on May 13, 2014.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>",

		"biography": "<p><b>Alan Price </b>(keyboards) started out as a northern British bluesman, playing with a combo - <b>Hilton Valentine</b> (guitar), <b>Chas Chandler </b>(bass) and <b>John Steel</b> (drums) -that was making a name for itself on the Newcastle club circuit. Price played a mean set of keyboards and had a soul-tinged voice that was sexy but standard, lacking the ferocity to cover the grubbier end of rock. However, in 1962 they recruited a suitably mean lead singer to fill out the sound and beef up the image. <b>Eric Burdon</b> had one of the grimiest voices in the business; he would throw himself into the songs, whip the band into overdrive and slaughter the audience. The original name of the group, The Alan Price Combo, had to go and <b>The Animals </b>came into being.</p><p>Supporting older, black musical legends like <a href=>John Lee Hooker</a>  and <a href=>Sonny Boy Williams</a>  as they toured the UK, the band grew into a professional unit, with Eric perfecting his skills as a rabble-rouser. The only dark cloud on the horizon was the rivalry between Alan and new frontman Eric, and the first signs of resentment soon began to show. In 1964 they moved to London, where they teamed up with then-unknown producer Mickie Most, and signed to Columbia. They blasted their way through Price's arrangement of the traditional ~House Of The Rising Sun~, which went to #1 in the UK, the USA and around the world.</p><p>For the rest of the 60s, The Animals hit the charts regularly, most famously with ~(Please) Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood~ and ~We Gotta Get Out Of This Place~. However, it wasn't long before ego problems resurfaced, and only two LPs - <i>The Animals</i> (1964) and <i>Animal Tracks</i> (1965) - were recorded before Price left to pursue a more mainstream solo career. He was quickly replaced by Newcastle's <b>Dave Rowberry</b>. Steel had also left the band by the release of its third album, <i>Animalism</i> (1966), the new drummer being the ex-Nashville Teen <b>Barry Jenkins</b>.</p><p>In the limbo of these personnel changes, Burdon recorded a solo single and an LP (<i>Eric Is Here</i>) and moved his base to California. There he formed a second incarnation of the band, <b>Eric Burdon & The Animals</b>, comprising Burdon, Jenkins, ex-Steampacket guitarist <b>Vic Briggs</b>, <b>John Wieder</b> (guitar/violin) and <b>Danny McCulloch</b> (bass). This line-up produced two LPs with a different style from the R&B stompers they'd kicked around in the clubs of London and the north of England. 1967's <i>Wind Of Change</i> featured tracks with titles such as ~Poem By The Sea~, ~It's All Meat~, and ~Yes, I Am Experienced~, Burdon's reply to the title of Jimi Hendrix's just-released debut album.</p><p> The new, 'psychedelic' Animals did fairly well, with chart successes at home and in the USA, but not well enough to avoid McCulloch and Briggs being replaced by bassist <b>Zoot Money </b>and guitarist <b>Andy Summers</b>. This final line-up was packed full of skilled musicians, each of whom had his own musical statement to make. Expecting them to function as a unit was demanding too much and after two minor LP releases, The Animals folded.</p><p>Alan Price was by now an 'all-round entertainer' having done TV, novelty songs, and worked briefly with fellow British bluesman Georgie Fame in a kind of R&B supergroup. Chas Chandler had hung up his bass to reinvent himself as a producer, working with Hendrix and British glam-popsters Slade. Wieder went on to become part of Family, Zoot Money went solo, and Andy Summers worked with Kevin Ayers and Kevin Coyne, before joining The Police. Eric Burdon kept on rocking, digging back down into the dirt for his next venture, WAR.</p><p>War's urban, Latin-tinged funk had to be put briefly on hold while the original Animals re-formed in early 1976 , releasing an album, <i>Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted,</i>which generated some interest on the nostalgia circuit. However, Price left almost immediately to continue his solo career and nothing more was heard from The Animals until they briefly re-formed again in 1983, recording a studio LP, <i>Ark (re-issued onCastle 1997),</i> and issuing <i>Rip It To Shreds,</i> a live hits compilation. They then, once again, returned to solo projects. Castle have also recently released <i>Greatest Hits - Live</i> recorded on tour in 1983 and frankly, one for the obsessive devotee only. </p>&mdash; <strong>Al Spicer</strong>",

				"review": "<p>Eric Burdon & the Animals were nearing the end of their string, at least in the lineup in which they'd come into the world in late 1966, when they recorded Every One of Us in May of 1968, just after the release of their second album, The Twain Shall Meet. The group had seen some success, especially in America, with the singles ~When I Was Young,~ ~San Franciscan Nights~ and ~Sky Pilot~ over the previous 18 months, but had done considerably less well with their albums. Every One of Us lacked a hit single to help drive its sales, but it was still a good psychedelic blues album, filled with excellent musicianship by Burdon (lead vocals), Vic Briggs (guitar, bass), John Weider (guitar, celeste), Danny McCulloch (bass,12-string, vocals), and Barry Jenkins (drums, percussion), with new member Zoot Money (credited, for contractual reasons, as George Bruno) on keyboards and vocals.</p><p>Opening with the surprisingly lyrical ~White Houses~ — a piece of piercing social commentary about America in early 1968 — the record slid past the brief bridge ~Uppers and Downers~ and into the extended, John Weider-authored psychedelic mood piece ~Serenade to a Sweet Lady,~ highlighted by Briggs' superb lead acoustic guitar playing and Weider's subdued electric accompaniment. This is followed by the acoustic folk piece ~The Immigrant Lad,~ a conceptual work that closes with a dialogue, set in a workingman's bar, in which two Cockney workers, voiced by John Weider and Terry McVay, talk about their world and their lives. ~Year of the Guru~ is another in a string of Jimi Hendrix-influenced pieces by this version of the Animals, showing the entire band at the peak of their musical prowess, and Burdon — taking on virtually the role of a modern rapper — generating some real power on some surprisingly cynical lyrics concerning the search for spiritual fulfillment and leaders. ~St. James Infirmary~ recalls ~House of the Rising Sun,~ as both a song and an arrangement, and is worthwhile just for the experience of hearing this version of the group going full-tilt as a rock band. And then there is ~New York 1963 — America 1968,~ an 18-minute conceptual track with a center spoken word section featuring not a group member, but a black engineer named Cliff, who recalls his experience as a fighter pilot during World War II, and tells of poverty then and now — although the opening section starts off well enough musically, amid Burdon's sung recollections of coming to America and his fixation on the blues and black music in general, and the closing repetition of the word ~freedom~ anticipates Richie Havens' famed piece (actually an extension of ~Motherless Child~) from Woodstock, the track is too long and unwieldy for any but the most fanatical listener to absorb as more than a curiosity of its time.</p><p>In fairness, it must also be said that Burdon's mixing of politics and music, social criticism and art, however inappropriate as pop music for a mass audience, was out in front of most of the competition during this period, in terms of boldness and reach, if not grasp. The extended jamming on this and the other songs also highlighted a fundamental problem that afflicted this version of the Animals from the get-go, the fact that they were touring too much to write enough songs to properly fill their albums, which meant extending the instrumental portions of everything that was on them, in order to fill up the running time; this group had the musicianship and talent to pull it off totally successfully in all but one instance here. This album would be one of the last times that this lineup of the group would appear on record — Briggs and McCulloch would leave later in the year, both to be replaced by Andy Somers (aka Andy Summers), and the group as a whole would pack it in with the waning of 1968.</p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong>"

		"firstname": "The",
		"lastname": "Band",
		"name": "The Band",
		"biography": "<p>For about six years, from 1968 through 1975, the Band was one of the most popular and influential rock groups in the world, their music embraced by critics (and, to asomewhat lesser degree, the public) as seriously as the music of <a href=~~>the Beatles</a> and <a href=~~>the RollingStones</a>. Their albums were analyzed and reviewed as intensely as any records by their one-time employer and sometime mentor <a href=~~>Bob Dylan</a>. And for a long time, their personalities were as recognizable individually to the casual music public as the members of <a href=~~>the Beatles</a>.</p><p>The group's history went back nearly as far as <a href=~~>the Beatles</a>, to 1958 (just about the time that the formative <a href=~~>Beatles</a> gave up skiffle for rock &amp; roll). Ronnie Hawkins, anArkansas-born rock &amp; roller who aspired to a real career, put together a backing band that year that included his fellow Arkansan <a href=~~>Levon Helm</a> (born May 26, 1942), who played drums (as well as credible guitar) and had led his own band, the Jungle Bush Beaters. The new outfit, Ronnie Hawkins &amp; the Hawks, was recording by the spring of 1958 and gigged throughout the south and also up in Ontario, Canada, where the money was better than in their native American south. It was the fact of being based in Canada late in 1959, coupled with pianist Willard Jones leaving the lineup, that got Hawkins to start looking at some of the local music talent in Toronto; Hawkins approached a musician named Scott Cushnie about joining the Hawks on keyboards. Cushniewas already playing in a band with <a href=~~>Robbie Robertson</a> (born in 1944), however, and would only join Hawkins if he camealong.</p> <p>After some resistance from Hawkins, Robertson came into the lineup on bass, replacing a departing Jimmy Evans. More multiple lineup switches took place over the next few years,<a href=~~>Robbie Robertson</a> shifting to rhythm guitar behind Fred Carter</a>'s (and, briefly, Roy Buchanan's) lead playing. <a href=~~>Rick Danko</a> (born December 9, 1943) came in on bass in 1961, followed byRichard Manuel (born April 3, 1944) on piano and backing vocals. Around that same time, Garth Hudson (born August 2, 1937), a classically trained musician who could read music, became the last piece of the initial puzzle as organ player.</p><p>For four years, from 1959 through 1963, Ronnie Hawkins &amp; the Hawks were one of the hottest rock &amp; roll bands working, which was very special in a time when rock &amp; rollhad supposedly died. Hawkins himself was practically Toronto's answer to Elvis Presley, and he remained true to the music even as Presley himself softened and broadened his sound. The mix of personalities within the group meshed well, better than they did with Hawkins, who,unbeknownst to him, was soon the odd man out in his own group. As new members Danko, Manuel, and Hudson came aboard — all Canadian, and replacing Hawkins' fellow southerners — Hawkins lost control of the group, to some extent, as they began working together more closely.</p><p>Finally, the Hawks parted company with Ronnie Hawkins during the summer of 1963, the singer's at times overbearing personality and ego getting the better of the relationship.The Hawks decided to stay together with their oldest member, <a href=~~>Levon Helm</a>, out in front, variously renaming themselves Levon &amp; the Hawks and the Canadian Squires and cutting records under both names. A hook-up with a young John Hammond Jr. for a series of recording sessions in New York led to the group'sbeing introduced to <a href=~~>Bob Dylan</a>, who was then preparing to pump up his sound in concert. Robertson and Helm played behind Dylan at his Forest Hills concert in New York in 1965 (a bootleg tape of which survives, and can be heard), and he ultimately signed up the entire group.</p><p>The hook-up with Dylan changed the Hawks, but it wasn't always an easy collaboration. In their five years backing Ronnie Hawkins, the group had played R&amp;B-based rock &amp;roll, heavily influenced by the sound of Chess Records in Chicago and Sun Records in Memphis. Additionally, they'd learned to play tightly and precisely and were accustomed toperforming in front of audiences that were interested primarily in having a good time and dancing. Now Dylan had them playing electric adaptations of folk music, with lots ofstrumming and lacking the kind of edge they were accustomed to putting on their work. His sound was traceable to the music of <a href=~~>Big Bill Broonzy</a> and Josh White, while they'd spent years playing the music of Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, and Bo Diddley. As it happens, all of those influences are related, but notdirectly, and not in ways that were obvious to the players in 1964.</p><p>Ironically, in the spring of 1965, the group had just missed their chance at what could have been a legendary meeting on record with a musician they did understand. They'dmet Arkansas-based blues legend <a href=~~>Sonny Boy WilliamsonII</a>, and jammed with the singer/blues harpist one day, hoping to cut some records with him. They hadn't realized it at the time, but Williamson was a dying man — by the timethe Hawks were ready to return and try to cut some records with him, he had passed on.</p> <p>Another problem for the group about working with Dylan concerned his audience. The Hawks had played in front of a lot of different audiences in the previous four years, but almost all of them were people primarily interested in enjoying themselves and having a goodtime. Dylan, however, was playing for crowds that seemed ready to reject him over principle. The Hawks weren't accustomed to confronting the kinds of passions that drove the folk audience, any more than they were initially prepared for the freewheeling nature ofDylan's performances — he liked to make changes in the way he did songs on the spot, and the group was often hard put to keep up with him, at least at first, although the experience did make them a more flexible ensemble on-stage.</p><p>Eventually the group did get together with Dylan as his backup band on his 1966 tour, although Levon Helm left soon after the tour began at the end of 1965. The group ultimatelyfell under the management orbit of Dylan's own manager, Albert Grossman, who persuaded the four core members (sans Helm) to join Dylan in Woodstock, NY, working on the sessions that ultimately became the <em>Basement Tapes</em> in their various configurations, none of whichwould be heard officially for almost a decade. (Indeed, up to this time, only a single song, ~Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,~ done live from the tour just ended, on a 45 B-side, had surfaced representing the group playing with Dylan).</p><p>Finally, a recording contract for the group — rechristened the Band — was secured byGrossman from Capitol Records. Levon Helm returned the fold, and the result was <em>Music From Big Pink</em>, an indirect outgrowth of the <em>Basement Tapes</em>. This album, enigmatically named and packaged, sounded like nothing else being done by anybody in music whenit was released in July of 1968. It was as though psychedelia, and the so-called British Invasion, had never happened; the group played and sang like five distinct individuals workingtoward the same goal, not mixing together smoothly. There was a collective sound to ~the band,~ but it made up five distinct individual voices and instruments mixing folk, blues, gospel, R&amp;B, classical, and rock &amp; roll.</p><p>The press latched on to the album before the public did, but over the next year, the Band became one of the most talked about phenemenon in rock music and <em>Music From Big Pink</em> acquired a mystique and significance akin to such albums as <em>Beggars Banquet</em>. The group and album ran counter to the so-called counterculture, and took a little getting used to,if only for their lack of a smooth, easily categorizable sound. Their music was steeped in Americana and historical and mythic American imagery, despite the fact that all of themembers except Helm came from Canada (which, in fact, may have helped them appreciate the culture they were dealing with, as outsiders). Robertson, Manuel, and Danko all wrote, and everyone but Robertson and Hudson sang; their vocals didn't mesh sweetly but simply flowed together in an informal manner. Classical organ flourishes meshed with a big (yet lean), raw rock &amp; roll sound and the whole was so far removed from the self-indulgent virtuosity and political and cultural posturing going on around them that the Band seemed to be operating in a different reality, to different rules.</p> <p>During this same period, the group's past association with <a href=~~>Bob Dylan</a> — whose name at the time had an almost mystical resonance with audiences — was mentioned in the rock press and also put right in the faces of listeners through a new phenomenon. Only a single track from the group's 1966 tour with Dylan had eversurfaced, and that was an out-of-print B-side to an old single. But in 1969, the first widely distributed bootleg LP, <em>The Great White Wonder</em>, featuring the then-unreleased<em>Basement Tapes</em>, started turning up on college campuses and record collectors' outlets. The quality was limited, the labels were blank, and there was no ~promotion~ as such ofthis patently illegal release, but it got around to hundreds of thousands of listeners and only heightened the mystique surrounding the Band.</p><p><em>Music From Big Pink</em></a>, which featured a painting by Bob Dylan on its cover, began selling — slowly at first and then better — and the group played a few select shows. A second album, simply titled <em>The Band</em>, was every bit as good as the first. Dominated byRobertson's writing, it was released in September of 1969, and with it, the group's reputation exploded; moreover, they began their climb out of the shadow of Bob Dylan withsongwriting of their own that was every bit a match for anything he was releasing at the time. A pair of songs, ~Up on Cripple Creek~ and ~The Night They Drove Ol' Dixie Down,~captured the public imagination, the former getting them onto <em>The Ed Sullivan Show</em> in an appearance that's fascinating to watch on the official Ed Sullivan video release; the host comes out to embrace and congratulate them, obviously thrilled after the psychedelic and hard rock acts that he usually booked, to see a group whose words and music he understood. Meanwhile, ~The Night They Drove Ol' Dixie Down~ became a popular radio track and yielded a hit cover version in the guise of an unaccountably corrupted rendition by Joan Baez (in which, for reasons that only Baez may be able to explain, Robert E. Lee is transformed into a steamboat) that made the Top Five.</p><p>Following the release of the second album, things changed somewhat within the group. Partly owing to the pressures of touring and the public's expectations of ~genius,~ and also to the growing press fixation on Robbie Robertson at the expense of the rest of the group, the other group members remained familiar enough that their names and personalitieswere well-known to the public. The Band was still a great working ensemble, as represented on their brilliant third album, <em>Stage Fright</em>, but gradually exhaustion and personal pressures took their toll. Additionally, the huge amounts of money that the membersstarted collecting, against hundreds of thousands and ultimately millions of record sales, led to instances of irresponsible behavior by individual members and their spousesand raised the pressure on the group to perform. The members had always engaged in a certain amount of casual drug use, mostly involving marijuana, but now they had access to moreserious and expensive chemical diversions. Some private resentments also began manifesting themselves about Robertson's dominance of the songwriting (some reality of which was questioned openly in Levon Helm's autobiography years later), and the fact that thegroup was now constantly in the public eye didn't help.</p><p>By the time of the fourth album, <em>Cahoots</em>, some of the glow of experimentation and easygoing comraderie was gone, though ironically, the album was still one of the bestreleased in 1971. The problem for the group became fulfilling all of the commitments involved in success, including touring and writing new material to record. By the end of 1971, they'ddecided to take a break, cutting a live album, <em>Rock of Ages</em>, that was all fans had to content themselves with in 1972. The fact that their next album, issued in 1973, was a collection of studio versions of the oldies that the group used to do on-stage, and numbers that they knew from their days as the Hawks, should have been a warning sign that not everything was well within the group. More troubling still was the fact that therenditions were so plain and flat sounding compared to the music they'd cut on every prior album; it simply wasn't up to the standard that one expected of the group and the fact thatthey didn't tour behind the record seemed to indicate that they were marking time with <em>Moondog Matinee</em>. The group did play one major show that year, at the race track at Watkins Glen, NY, before the largest audience ever assembled for a rock concert — it was ademonstration of their place in the rock pantheon that the Band was booked alongside the Grateful Dead and <a href=~~>the Allman Brothers Band</a>.</p><p>The year 1973 was also where they let the other shoe drop on their association with Bob Dylan, cutting the <em>Planet Waves</em> album with him and preparing for a huge nationaltour together in 1974. That tour, in retrospect, seemed more a basis for cashing in on their association with Dylan than for any new music-making of any significance. In many critics' eyes, the Band was superior to Dylan in their performances, an idea borne out on much of the live LP <em>Before the Flood</em> that was distilled down from the two February 14, 1974, performances. Everyone made a fortune from it, but the tour with Dylan also thrust thegroup right into the middle of the most decadent part of the rock world. A lot of the simplicity and directness of their music and lives succumbed to the easy availability of sex,drugs, and other diversions and the expensive lifestyles they were all starting to maintain.</p> <p>By the end of 1974, the Band had expended much of the good will they'd built up from their first four albums. Another album, <em>Northern Lights — Southern Cross</em> released in late 1975, was a major comeback and restored some of the group's reputation as a cutting-edge ensemble, even encompassing elements of synthesizer music into its writing and production. Around this same time, Levon Helm and Garth Hudson made a belated contribution to the history of Chess Records (in light of their near-miss with Sonny Boy Williamson a decade earlier) when they worked with Muddy Waters, cutting an entire album with the blues legend at Helm's studio in Woodstock, NY. The Muddy Waters <em>Woodstock Album</em>, although ignored at the time by everyone but the critics, was the last great album cut by the label or by Waters at the label,  and his best album in at least five years.</p> <p>It was too late to save the Band as a working ensemble, however; the members were all involved in their own interests and lives and the group stopped touring. The inevitablebest-of album in 1976, ahead of what proved to be their final tour, marked the unofficial end of the original lineup's history. One last new album, <em>Islands</em>, fulfilled the group's contract and had some fine moments, but they never toured behind it and it was clear to one and all that the Band was finished as a going concern. The group marked the end of their days as an active unit with the release of the film (and accompanying soundtrack LP set)<em>The Last Waltz</em>, directed by Martin Scorsese, of their farewell concert, which was an all-star performing affair pulling together the talents of Ronnie Hawkins, Muddy Waters, <a href=~~>Eric Clapton</a>, <a href=~~>Neil Young</a>, <a href=~~>Van Morrison</a>, and a dozen other luminaries drawn from the ranks of old friends, admirers, and idols of theirs. Robertson and Helm pursued musical and film careers, while Danko tried to start a solo career of his own.</p> <p>Capitol Records kept repackaging their music on vinyl with an <em>Anthology</em> collection and a second best-of LP, as well as a pair of CD recompilations, <em>To Kingdom Come</em> and <em>Across the Great Divide</em>, in the '90s. As it turned out the members, apart from Robertson, weren't quite as ready or willing to close the book on the group, in part because they saw no reason to and also because several of them proved unable to sustain profitable solo careers (Robertson, having written most of the songs, had a steady income from the publishing as well as the record sales). The other members of the group reunited at various times — in 1983, four members of the Band, with Robertson replaced by Earl Cate of the Cate Brothers on guitar, reunited for a tour that yielded a full-length concert video and a healthy audience response. The death of Richard Manuel in 1986 cast a dark pall on any future reunions, of which there were several — Robertson issued his first solo album a year later, which included a tribute to Manuel (~Fallen Angel~).</p> <p>This was as close as the guitarist would get to a Band reunion, however, which became a bone of contention among onlookers and the members. Robertson publicly questioned what the meaning of <em>The Last Waltz</em> had been and would never participate. And as the group's major songwriter and principal guitarist, he was their most famous member, but he almost never sang significant vocal parts on their recordings (indeed, it is said that one reason their set from Woodstock was never issued was because his mic was live and his voice too prominent). Other guitarists could build on his work well enough, and the rest of the group had made significant contributions to virtually every song they ever did, so the reunions made sense. In 1993, the Band released <em>Jericho</em>, their first new album in 16 years, which received surprisingly good reviews. <em>High on the Hog</em> followed in 1996 and two years later, they celebrated their 30th anniversary with <em>Jubilation</em>. The death of Rick Danko in his sleep at his home in Woodstock on December 10, 1999, the day after his 56th birthday, seemed to call an end to future activities by any version of the Band.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Formed: 1967, Toronto, Canada (as The Hawks), split up 1976, reformed 80s and 90s </p><p><strong>The Band</strong> were one of the most influential yet insular rock groups to emerge from the late 60s music scene. These four Canadians, <a href=~~>Robbie  Robertson</a> (guitar), <strong>Richard Manuel</strong> (piano/drums/vocals), <a HREF=~Locate.asp?art=92~>Rick Danko</a> (bass/fiddle/vocals), <strong>Garth Hudson</strong> (keyboards/saxophones), and Arkansas native <a HREF=~Locate.asp?art=172~>Levon Helm</a> (drums/mandolin/vocals), came to embody the new-found musical maturity that followed the flower-power era, welding songcraft with passion in songs that re-introduced a sense of perspective and tradition into American music. </p><p>As <strong>The Hawks</strong>, they backed wild rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins, moulding into a tight and cohesive unit, dominated by Robertson's feral guitar work. Having broken awayfrom Hawkins' limited range, their growing range of musical styles attracted the attentions of <a href=~~>Bob Dylan</a>, who invited Helm and Robertson to back him at his controversial Forest Hills 'electric' concert. Helm left, disenchanted at the level ofhostility at these concerts, but the rest of the group joined up to back Dylan on his 1965 world tour. </p> <p>As Helm re-joined, the group followed Dylan to Woodstock to record a rootsier set of informal sessions, later issued as <a href=~~><em>The Basement Tapes</em></a> (1975), a mixed bag of traditional and new material both serious and playful in turn. The distinctive voices of the three lead singers now began to emerge, with Manuel's soulful Ray Charles voice offset by Helm's solid, gritty Southern twang, and Danko's edgy, quavering tone. </p><p>More significantly, both Robertson and Manuel began to develop as songwriters in the presence of Dylan. This was evident on the release of the group's debut album, <a href=~~><em>Music From Big Pink</em></a> (1968), which came across as a calming and restrained voice in a world of feedback-drenched guitar solos. With the three singers trading call-and-response vocals, and players switching instruments according to the needs of the particular song, the group were about the sheer joy of playing music stripped of gimmick and artifice. Robertson's guitar moved sparely in and out of the songs, with Danko's Motown-influenced bass filling in the gaps, whilst Helm's drums gave a rock-solid backbeat over which Hudson's whirling, inventive organ let loose an imaginative array of sounds to match the oddball smalltown characters that peopled the richly metaphorical songs. There wasa powerful sense of mystery in Robertson songs like ~The Weight~ and ~Caledonia Mission~, whereas Manuel was more direct on the plaintive ballads ~In A Station~ and ~Lonesome Suzie~ and the magical ~We Can Talk~, which more than any other song showcased the breadth of the group's abilities. Add to this the transformation worked on Dylan's ~Tears Of Rage~ by Manuel's vocal, and the result was an album that caused the rock community to suddenlysit up and pay very close attention to this unassuming group. </p> <p>The Band did not tour the album, instead recording <a href=~~><em>The Band</em></a> (1969). Rooted heavily in a sense of rural tradition, the album came across like a folk history of an America that was in danger of being lost in the chaotic swirl of postwar life. Musically and lyrically more direct than its predecessor, it reached deeper into thestorytelling tradition. Robertson, in particular, reached a creative peak with compelling narratives like ~The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down~, ~The Unfaithful Servant~ and ~King Harvest (Has Surely Come)~. </p> <p>Despite a terrible initial live appearance (where Robertson was unsuccessfully hypnotized to overcome stage fright), they were able to provide controlled and often compelling concert performances. All the same, their multi-instrumental prowess could not save a gradual descent into rock-star bad habits. Manuel's songwriting talent suffered, in particular, leaving Robertson to take over such duties, notably on <strong><em>Stage Fright</em></strong> (1970). Here, he cast his gaze over early 70s unease and paranoia on ~The Rumor~, while slices of narrative Americana like ~Just Another Whistle Stop~ made the album a worthy, if inconsistent andunsettling, listen. But <strong><em>Cahoots</em></strong> (1971) revealed that such negative moods had invaded the group, to the detriment of the songs. They took stock with a live album, <a href=~~><em>Rock Of Ages </em></a>(1972), which showcased Allen Toussaint's horn arrangements and Garth Hudson's astonishing organ work - a reminder of his importance in filling out the group's sound. The covers album, <a href=~~><em>Moondog Matinee</em></a> (1973), reproduced a club setting The Hawks would have played ten years earlier, but, after further collaborations with Dylan, their 1975 album, <a href=~~><em>Northern Lights, Southern Cross</em></a>, highlighted by Hudson's intricately layered keyboards, did not resolve their growing personal problems. </p> <p>With Robertson announcing enough was enough, The Band organized <a href=~~><em>The Last Waltz </em></a>farewell concert for Thanksgiving Day, 1976. A supporting cast ranging from <strong>Muddy Waters</strong> and <a href=~~>Van Morrison</a>, to <a href=~~>Dylan</a>, <a href=~~>Neil Young</a> and <a href=~~>Joni Mitchell</a>, joined the group on stage for a stylish (if overblown) celebration. Nevertheless the event was a success, especially Martin Scorsese's accompanying, revealing film - one of rock's finer moments on celluloid. After the dismal, contract-filling <strong><em>Islands</em></strong> (1977), Helm, Danko and Robertson embarked on solo careers. </p><p>The Band re-formed in the mid-80s, without Robertson, but were knocked back when Richard Manuel took his own life in 1986. A second comeback, in the 90s, has produced  <strong><em>Jericho</em></strong> (1994) and <strong><em>High On The Hog </em></strong>(1996). For these outings, three new members replaced Robertson and Manuel, while the material relied on blues and R&B covers. Nonetheless, occasional moments of magic rise to the surface, notably the former album's <em><strong>The Caves Of Jericho</strong></em>. </p>  <p>Check out Jan Hiberg's marvellous <a href=~/~>Band website</a> <br/></p><p><a href=~~><strong>Music From Big Pink</strong></a> (1968; Capitol). Demonstrates just how closely five bearded white men could get to the feel of gospel and soul music, whilst still being unmistakably a rock group. It also highlights Richard Manuel's much-missed songwriting capabilities. </p><p><a href=~~><strong>The Band</strong></a> (1969; Capitol). An album as brilliant today as when it was released. The Band at their most essential. </p><p><strong>Stage Fright</strong> (1970; Capitol). Another strong set of songs, despite the bad vibesseeping from them. ~The Rumor~ is one of the best songs ever written about gossip and intrigue. </p><p><a href=~~><strong>Rock Of Ages</strong></a> (1972; Capitol). Cheaper than <a href=~~><em><strong>The Last Waltz</strong></em></a>, and more focused than <em><strong><u>Live</u></strong></em><em><strong> At Watkins Glen</strong></em>, this remains their best available live album. Manuel's voice had started to deteriorate, but thecracking horns cover any gaps and re-invigorate the songs. This also serves as a useful greatest hits package. </p><p>&mdash; <strong>Nicholas Oliver</strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>The first studio album of Band originals since 1971's Cahoot. In many respects, Northern Lights-Southern Cross was viewed as a comeback. It also can be seen as a swan song, in that its recording marked the last time the five members would work together in the studio as a permanent group, with a commitment to making a record they would tour behind and build on as a working band. The album was also, ironically enough, the Band's finest since their self-titled sophomore effort, even outdoing Stage Fright.</p><p>It was spawned after a series of battery-recharging events, the move of all five members out of Woodstock, New York and to Malibu, California, into a new, state-of-the-art 24-track studio that not only felt right but offered them (especially Garth Hudson, working with Moog synthesizers and other new instruments, as well as brass and reeds) a bigger creative and sonic canvas than they'd ever known before; and the decision to finally let the other shoe drop on their early career, accompanying Bob Dylan on their first-ever studio album together (Planet Waves) which, in turn, had led to an eight-week tour together, this time captured for posterity and, unlike their mid-'60s Dylan tour, rushed out midway through the work on the album at hand.</p><p>Between all of that, their own live album (Rock of Ages), and the Moondog Matinee album of rock & roll and R&B covers, the group found itself with more music in print at one time than they'd ever dreamed possible, despite the four-year gap in new material, and in several genres and modes, and blossoming in some unexpected directions -- just prior to the start of the sessions for this album, Levon Helm and Garth Hudson had fulfilled another milestone, the goal of doing an honest-to-God blues album (which dated from the group's tragically brief liaison with Sonny Boy Williamson in 1965), producing and/or playing on what ended up being a Grammy-winning LP by Muddy Waters, the Woodstock Album. It was time to make some of their own music again, and Robbie Robertson obliged by showing up with a bumper crop of great new compositions. Northern Lights-Southern Cross totals eight songs in all, and he and the rest of the group rose to the occasion, luxuriating in the range afforded by the studio (christened Shangri-La, a reference to the idyllic haven for art and civilization in James Hilton's novel Lost Horizon -- the vibes were that good).</p><p>On this album the Band explore new timbres, utilizing 24 tracks and what was (then) new synthesizer technology, and also opening out their sound in some unexpected ways. After years of restrained, economical playing Robbie Robertson -- who was practically the Count Basie of rock guitarists in terms of following a less-is-more philosophy -- stepped out in front with flashy, extroverted playing on ~Forbidden Fruit,~ a semi-autobiographical (about the group) cautionary rock ballad; his elegant trills and flourishes on ~Hobo Jungle~; his twanging and twisting away behind Hudson's beautiful, complex brass and horn parts on ~Ophelia~, a close relative of ~W.S. Walcott Medicine Show~ from Stage Fright, which captured the kind of old-timey New Orleans sound that the group had also embraced, in the form of covers, on Moondog Matinee.</p><p>Robertson and Hudson seem to feed off one another's presence throughout, perhaps best of all on ~Ring Your Bell,~ which also restores the group's trademarked shared vocals. ~It Makes No Difference~ might be the best romantic ballad ever done by the group, while the ebullient ~Jupiter Hollow~ is an exceptional track three times over, a brilliant showcase for keyboards (and not just by Hudson -- Robertson forsakes the guitar here for a clavinet), as well as offering Levon Helm and Richard Manuel tripling up on percussion with a drum machine. ~Rags and Bones~ is one of Robertson's most deceptively personal songs, and features the most elaborate keyboard sounds of any recording in the group's history. ~Acadian Driftwood~ stands out as one of Robertson's finest compositions, equal to anything else the Band ever recorded, and a slightly more complex and ambitious (and successful) down-north analog to ~The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.~ The vocals by Helm, Manuel, and Rick Danko were all spot-on as well, on this last great musical statement from the group, and the fact that it only made number 26 on the charts is much more indicative of the state of music radio and Capitol's marketing department (which was only really good at selling Beatles and Beach Boys reissues at the time), than any flaws in the record. [The 2001 reissue offers exceptional sound, upgraded to 24-bit mastering, and extends the running time by seven delightful minutes with the addition of a pair of bonus tracks, an early run-through of ~Twilight,~ which was released as a single in the wake of the LP, and a stripped down, upbeat rehearsal version of ~Christmas Must Be Tonight~; but either version one gets of Northern Lights-Southern Cross, is worth owning].</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Rob Bowman</strong></p>"

				"review": "<P>Given the countless Band compilations released over the years, plus the exhaustive bonus-track-laden reissues of the proper albums in 2000 and 2001, it's easy to be suspicious of the six-disc A Musical History, especially since it's the third Band box set released in the CD era. It would seem that all the worthwhile previously unreleased music has been excavated and that the Band's career has been anthologized in every possible way, but A Musical History proves that's not true. As its title implies, the set is a biography, tracing the group's career from their early days as the Hawks supporting Ronnie Hawkins, through their stint as Levon &amp; the Hawks, through their time as Bob Dylan's backing band in 1966, through their emergence as the Band in 1968, then through their years of stardom in the early '70s, leading up to their departure at The Last Waltz in 1976. No previous compilation has done this -- they've either picked up the story with Music from Big Pink or offered up the greatest hits, and they've never weaved Ronnie Hawkins or Bob Dylan tracks into the story line -- and this thorough, all-encompassing approach does result in an absorbing narrative that does provide some revelations, most arriving on the spectacular, necessary first disc that traces the evolution of the band before they were the Band.</P><P>Here, for the first time on a Band album, you get to hear the group's beginning as a rough rock &amp; roll and blues combo, and while some of this material is a bit generic (albeit in the best possible sense, since they were a lean, tough, straight-ahead rock &amp; roll group), this music echoes throughout the four CDs that follow, whether it's in the muscular R&amp;B grooves of Levon Helm and Rick Danko, Robbie Robertson's tight, squealing guitar, or Richard Manual's piano chord clusters, or how the group touched on rockabilly, Motown, New Orleans R&amp;B, country, and folk even on their earliest recordings. In this context, their teaming with Dylan not only seems like a natural outgrowth of their work as the struggling Levon &amp; the Hawks, but it's clear that Dylan helped give the band focus and ideas, inspiring not just the songs that the group wrote for Music from Big Pink, but the whole Americana aesthetic that came to define the Band and made them separate from their rock &amp; roll peers of the late '60s.Once A Musical History hits the second disc, the Band's story enters familiar territory and the revelations start drying up even if the unreleased material doesn't (there are a whopping 32 unreleased tracks on this 102-song set, and there's about ten or so other cuts that could qualify as rarities, as well).</P><P>All the same, the conventional story line carries more weight here, since the first disc not only provides context, but because the sequencing and song selection are excellent, helping to drive the Band's story in addition to just being flat-out entertaining. Plus, there are some great rarities scattered throughout here, including an exciting, careening live version of Woody Guthrie's ~I Ain't Got No Home~ with Bob Dylan that was only released on a Woody tribute album, the funky, gritty ~Baby Lou,~ a raucous ~Slippin' &amp; Slidin'~ from the Festival Express tour in 1970, hard-rocking live versions of ~Strawberry Wine~ and ~Look out Cleveland~ from Royal Albert Hall in 1971, a live ~Highway 61 Revisited~ with Bob Dylan from a 1974 Madison Square Garden show, and Rick Danko's sweet, lazy unreleased ~Home Cookin'~ from 1976. These not only help keep a familiar story interesting to the hardcore fans (who, after all, are the primary audience for such a lavish set as this), but help fill little details within that story, along with illustrating how good the Band could sound as a band right up until the very end of their career. Despite all this, the arc of their career -- the sudden, glorious beginning and the slow descent into equal parts pretension and lethargy -- can't help but shine through in a biography such as this. No amount of well-chosen rarities and expert song sequencing (all the group's major songs, along with all of their noteworthy minor tunes, are here in some incarnation or another) can hide the downward turn in the Band's fortunes.</P><P>There was a pretty steep decline in quality material after their third album, Stage Fright, in 1970, and while the next four studio albums, plus the live Rock of Ages and The Last Waltz, are summarized on the final two discs of the set, it's hard to ignore how covers keep popping up or how numerous songs are repeated in different versions (no matter how good the alternate versions are, it's clear that the group was running out of strong new songs), nor is it easy to ignore that the rest of the Band, for whatever reason, simply stopped writing, transferring the burden to Robbie Robertson, who struggled to come up with songs that seemed as effortless and graceful as his early songs, despite a slight rejuvenation on Northern Lights-Southern Cross. That doesn't mean these last two discs are bad -- far from it, they put the best spin on an uneven era -- but they do make it clear that the Band were caught at an awkward spot and were unable to successfully move forward, no matter how much Robertson prodded. As the accompanying DVD, which has nine live performances beginning with a 1970 clip from Woodstock and ending with three spots from Saturday Night Live in 1976, illustrates, Robertson had his mind elsewhere, but the rest of the guys were happy to simply be in a band. Being the one with ambitions, Robertson made the move and brought the curtains down on their career when the rest of the Band weren't necessarily ready to call it quits, as evidenced by their ongoing reunions in the '80s and '90s.</P><P>Despite the existence of a touring Band minus their guitarist and songwriter, Robertson wound up as the member who was generally acknowledged as the one who kept the spirit of the group alive, at least according to the mainstream rock press. He also shepherded nearly all of the official Band reissues, including this one, where he acts as executive producer and the main interview for Rob Bowman's detail-heavy, perhaps too affectionate liner notes. Bowman's long piece ends abruptly when Robertson leaves the group; it's acknowledged that the Band soldiered on, but this fact is dismissed quickly, since it doesn't fit the romanticized notion of the Band's career that Robertson has been selling since Martin Scorsese's The Last Waltz. The bad blood between Robertson and Levon Helm runs too deep for them to make friends over this project (Garth Hudson is credited as an archival producer), but that acrimony is only noticeable within the liner notes to this beautiful hardcover book-styled box set. The five discs captures the Band at their peak as a band, containing their very best music. Music from Big Pink and The Band remain the essential, definitive albums, the records that not only capture their essence but have a nearly mythical grandeur. This box is for those who already know and love the group, who know their ups and downs, and who want to hear them in all their glory -- and, as this proves, the Band were glorious indeed.</P><P>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B></P>"

But as an album, The Last Waltz soundtrack had to compete with the Band's earlier live album, Rock of Ages, with which it bears a certain superficial resemblance -- both found the group trying to create something grander than the standard-issue live double, and both featured the group beefed up by additional musicians. While Rock of Ages found the Band swinging along with the help of a horn section arranged by Allen Toussaint, The Last Waltz boasts a horn section (using Toussaint's earlier arrangements on a few cuts) and more than a baker's dozen guest stars, ranging from old cohorts Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan to contemporaries Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, and Van Morrison. the Band are in fine if not exceptional form here; on most cuts, they don't sound quite as fiery as they did on Rock of Ages, though their performances are never less than expert, and the high points are dazzling, especially an impassioned version of ~It Makes No Difference~ and blazing readings of ~Up on Cripple Creek~ and ~The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down~ (Levon Helm has made no secret that he felt breaking up the Band was a bad idea, and here it sounds if he was determined to prove how much they still had to offer). Ultimately, it's the Band's ~special guests~ who really make this set stand out -- Muddy Waters' ferocious version of ~Mannish Boy~ would have been a wonder from a man half his age, Van Morrison sounds positively joyous on ~Caravan,~ Neil Young and Joni Mitchell do well for their Canadian brethren, and Bob Dylan's closing set finds him in admirably loose and rollicking form. (One question remains -- what exactly is Neil Diamond doing here?) And while the closing studio-recorded ~Last Waltz Suite~ sounds like padding, the contributions from Emmylou Harris and the Staple Singers are beautiful indeed. It could be argued that you're better off watching The Last Waltz on video than listening to it on CD, but either way it's a show well worth checking out.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Even taking into account inflation, it's ironic in this era of $250 concert tickets that critics harped when the Band charged $25 for their legendary November 1976 farewell show at San Francisco's Winterland. That price not only included Thanksgiving dinner, but also numerous guest superstars who'd influenced, worked with, and/or shared the Canadian roots of Robbie Robertson and crew. What transpired was a grand celebration of North American musical forms. There are numerous definitive performances here--from Van Morrison's goose-bump-inducing ~Caravan~ and solo rendition of the beautiful Irish standard ~Tura Lura Lural~ (Celtic music inspired those Appalachians in the first place) to Bob Dylan and ~the Hawks~ delivering a pop-metallic ~Baby, Let Me Follow You Down,~ first captured on the Royal Albert Hall Concert tapes. But because this new fleshed-out version--produced and compiled by Robertson--includes surprises (late blues legend Muddy Waters's endearing take on Louis Jordan's ~Caledonia~; current blues legend Dylan's ~Hazel~), treasures (~This Wheels on Fire,~ Neil Young's ~Four Strong Winds~), and two jam sessions that just don't add much, the new box set simply matches and enhances--but doesn't top--the original three-LP version of this wonderful slice of rock &amp; roll history.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bill Holdship</strong></p><hr/><p>Note that the CD booklet for 2-disc version of The Last Waltz has only black and white photos while the booklet in the original LP had color photos. The entire undubbed concert was released as a 4 CD bootleg set in 1995. See also the pages for the Last Waltz video, the movie (Internet Movie Database) and Jonathan Katz' article on the different versions of the Last Waltz.</p><p>In May/April 2002, United Artists, MGM Home Entertainment, and Rhino Records re-released the film, a special edition DVD with a remastered and remixed soundtrack, and a remastered four-CD boxed set, all featuring performances from the concert that didn't make the original film or album. A 30-track audio DVD was also released in 2002.</p><p>The DVD contains not only the film but also previously unreleased ~jam footage~ featuring the Band and concert guests such as Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Neil Young, the Rolling Stones' Ron Wood, Dr. John, and Stephen Stills. Scorsese and Robertson provide scene-by-scene commentary for the DVD, and there are interviews with surviving Band members Levon Helm and Garth Hudson, concert guests Ronnie Hawkins and Mavis Staples, and various crew members and journalists who covered the event, along with a photo gallery and the original theatrical trailer for the film.</p><p>The four discs in the Last Waltz boxed set on Rhino (~dedicated to the memory of Rick Danko and Richard Manuel~), feature a variety of previously unreleased performances featuring Van Morrison, Dr. John, Paul Butterfield, and Emmylou Harris. New liner notes have been written by Rolling Stone magazine's David Fricke, and an 80-page booklet feature previously unseen photos, notes, and memorabilia.</p><p>Warner/Rhino released a two disc abbreviated version of the box set in September 2003, at about half the cost. This set doesn't include the bonus material, presenting instead just the 30 songs that were included on the original 3-LP release from 1978. It does, however, feature the same remix &amp; remastering upgrade used for the 2002 box set and comes with a booklet containing photos &amp; liner notes by David Fricke.</p><p>The original 30-track 3-LP box was also re-released in February 2003 by Rhino Handmade, as a limited-edition set (1500 copies) pressed on 180-gram virgin vinyl and featuring the new Robbie Robertson mixes included on Rhino's four-CD boxed set released in 2002. Each copy was individually signed by Robbie Robertson and included a lidded box and original booklet, facsimile of original concert poster, facsimile of original concert ticket, facsimile of original artist roster, facsimile of original round table placard, lacsimile of a Boris Levin painting, replica of original backstage badge, photo of each performer from the concert and a single-sheet reproduction of album cover signed by Robbie Robertson.<br/></p><h4>Disc 1</h4><ol><li>Theme From The Last Waltz - With Orchestra</li><p><strong>The Concert</strong> </p><li>Up On Cripple Creek</li><li>The Shape I'm In</li><li>It Makes No Difference</li><li>Who Do You Love - with Ronnie Hawkins</li><li>Life Is A Carnival</li><li>Such A Night - with Dr. John</li><li>* The Weight</li><li>Down South In New Orleans - with Bobby Charles</li><li>* This Wheel's On Fire</li><li>Mystery Train - with Paul Butterfield</li><li>* Caledonia - with Muddy Waters</li><li>Mannish Boy - with Muddy Waters</li><li>Stage Fright </li></ol><h4>Disc 2</h4><ol><li>* Rag Mama Rag</li><li>* All Our Past Times - with Eric Clapton</li><li>Further On Up The Road - with Eric Clapton</li><li>Ophelia</li><li>Helpless - with Neil Young</li><li>* Four Strong Winds - with Neil Young</li><li>Coyote - with Joni Mitchell</li><li>* Shadows And Light - with Joni Mitchell</li><li>* Furry Sings The Blues - with Joni Mitchell</li><li>* Acadian Driftwood</li><li>Dry Your Eyes - with Neil Diamond</li><li>* The W.S.

Under the name Andy Badale, he entered the film industry in 1973, debuting with the score to the action film Gordon's War. Despite subsequent work on such features as 1974's Law and Disorder and 1976's Across the Great Divide, Badalamenti remained largely unknown before hooking up with Lynch on the soundtrack of the director's 1986 masterpiece Blue Velvet; they subsequently worked together on the features Wild at Heart, Lost Highway, and The Straight Story. Perhaps the most famous fruit of their collaboration was the cult hit television series Twin Peaks, for which Badalamenti created one of the most distinctive and evocative theme songs in TV history. The duo also wrote and produced a pair of LPs for ethereal chanteuse Julee Cruise, 1989's Floating into the Night and 1993's The Voice of Love, and staged an avant-garde musical theater piece titled Industrial Symphony No. 1. In 1996, Badalamenti shifted gears, teaming with James vocalist Tim Booth for the LP Booth and the Bad Angel. Badalamenti subsequently worked on the scores for such films as Dark Water, The Wicker Man and Edge of Love. </p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jason Ankeny</strong></p>",

The rest of the music, instantly recognizable to anyone who saw even one episode of the series, borders on fever-dream jazz. Lynch favorite Julee Cruise sings the only three vocal songs.

George Harrison </p><p>The Rolling Stones may have rocked harder and Dylan may have been smarter, but neither could claim the cultural impact of <B>The Beatles</B>. Throughout the 60s, they were always in tune with the times, and in their bitter dissolution they reflected the fragmentation of pop culture at the end of the decade. The Beatles catalogue forms perhaps the most important body of work in popular music, representing not only the development of themusicians themselves, but also the development of the modern music business. They are the ultimate pop group and one of the few bands that transcend the limitations of their art to produce music that is universal. Yet at the heart of the Beatles odyssey is the story of two lads who became the best of friends and were split up by marriage. It could be any young man's rite of passage, except that the people involved happened to be two of the greatest songwriters of the late twentieth century. </p><p>Fate dealt the winning hand on July 6, 1957, when budding rocker <b>Paul McCartney </b>went to see a local band, The Quarrymen, at a church fete in Woolton. McCartney got talking to the rhythm guitarist, a certain <A HREF=~Locate.asp?art=227~>John Lennon</a>, and found they had a mutual interest in Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent and Little Richard. McCartney was soon asked to join the band and started writing songs with Lennon, though most of their set consisted of the crowd-pleasing hits of the day. By 1960, they had acquired a new name, a manager and a fairly stable line-up of <A HREF=~Locate.asp?art=166~>George Harrison</a> on lead guitar, <b>Stu Sutcliffe</b> onbass and <b>Pete Best </b>on drums. That same year, The Beatles secured a residency in Hamburg, a favoured haunt for early British rockers, which proved to be the making of the band. The living was rough and wild, with the fresh-faced Liverpool teens exposed overnight to the pleasures of speed, Existentialism, all night drinking, fighting and the Reeperbahn's notorious red-light zone. Most importantly of all, their punishing schedule of threesets a night turned them into seasoned professionals within only a few months. The Existentialist input came from Stu Sutcliffe's German girlfriend Astrid Kirchherr, who created much of the early Beatles look. On their second Hamburg stint, Sutcliffe himself dropped out of the band, leaving McCartney to take over on bass. </p><p>The Beatles returned to Liverpool in June 1961, to find that their frenzied playing went down a storm at home as well as in Germany. Within a few months they acquired a new manager, Brian Epstein, and a residency at The Cavern, where they soon became local heroes at the centre of Liverpool's beat boom. But with their horizons opened by their time in Europe, their eyes turned to London and a national record deal. Derek Rowe of Decca has gone down in history as the man who turned down The Beatles, but he certainly wasn't the only one to reject Brian Epstein's overtures. In fact, it was hit or miss as to whether EMI/Parlophone would sign them, but it seems that producer George Martin liked their sense of humour as much as their music (he had worked on comedy for Peter Sellers and many other acts) anddecided to take a chance. However, one final and controversial change remained: next time The Beatles returned to London's Abbey Road studios in September 1962, <b>Ringo Starr</b>, previously of Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, was in the drummer's seat. The reason was as much musical as personal (whether it had anything to do with the fact that Pete Best was too good-looking for the others' liking is of course debatable) but the girls at The Cavern didn't see things this way and in one of the ensuing punch-ups George Harrison sustained a black eye. He was stillsporting it as The Beatles struggled through their first commercial recording, a Lennon and McCartney composition called &quot;Love Me Do''. </p><p>Today it sounds like a pretty lightweight affair, but its refreshing directness made it stand out at a time when mostBritish pop was compressed and reverb-laden in the Joe Meek school. It reached an unimpressive #17 and in the hope of the top slot The Beatles threw everything into their next effort, &quot;Please Please Me''. This time there was no doubt, as it smashed in at #1 following a live appearance on the <i>Thank Your Lucky Stars </i>TV show. Teenage audiences were mesmerized by this fresh new group with the long hair and the buttoned-down suits; slowly but surely, Beatlemania was spreading. </p> <p>As luck would have it, George Martin turned out to be the perfect producer for the band. Acting on instinct, he decided to make their debut album something better than the usual cash-in of the time. <b><i>Please Please Me</i></b>, recorded in one marathon session, was a lively mix of their own compositions and standards from their stage act, including a frenzied version of &quot;Twist And Shout''. By now, the Lennon and McCartney hitmachine was working in overdrive, producing a string of singles that were both innovative and fiendishly catchy: &quot;From Me To You'', &quot;She Loves You'', &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand''. By the time of the November 1963 release of their second album, <b><i>With The Beatles</i></b>, they were established as Britain's favouritegroup, on a scale that was previously unheard of. The obvious next step was America, and their fabled appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show on February 9, 1964, decided it. A country shocked by the recent assassination of JFK took the moptops to their hearts, so that by April The Beatles held the top five position in the US singles charts and an unbelievable fourteen slots in the <i>Billboard </i>Hot 100. It was as if the visiting Brits had kick-started America's 50s rock explosion back and into a higher gear of intensity. </p><p>Back in the studio, The Beatles produced the rousing &quot;Can't Buy Me Love'' and then, in a frenzied bout ofrecording and film-making, <b><i>A Hard Day's Night</i></b>, thesoundtrack to a brilliant study of Beatlemania directed byRichard Lester. The public were delighted to find that as well asbeing talented tunesmiths with a rowdy stage act, The Beatlesalso looked great on the screen. However, they were alreadystarting to move beyond the confines of their beat group image,with both Harrison and Lennon showing a strong interest in BobDylan. The two key forces in 60s music met for the first timethat August in New York, when Dylan turned The Beatles on to thedelights of dope. </p><p><A HREF=~Locate.asp?album=43~><i>Beatles For Sale</i></a>, their second album of 1964,was mostly a slightly more soulful variation of their usual fare,though Lennon's &quot;I'm A Loser'' showed a new emotional depthand hinted at new influences in their music. The catalyst arrivedsome time in early 1965, when The Beatles had their firstencounter with LSD, an experience reflected in the density andsensual languor of their next single, &quot;Ticket To Ride''. Theexperimentation continued on their soundtrack album for theirsecond film, <em><strong>Help!</strong></em><i>, </i>whichboasted the Dylanesque &quot;You've Got To Hide Your Love Away''and McCartney's deathless ballad &quot;Yesterday'', as well asthe superb title track. </p><p>After another hectic round of touring, including the SheaStadium gig (yes, they gave us the horrors of stadium rock too),The Beatles found themselves pushed to match a batch of summersingles from the likes of the Kinks, Animals, Rolling Stones, andof course Bob Dylan, who'd just capped &quot;SubterraneanHomesick Blues'' with the astonishing &quot;Like A RollingStone''. They rose to the occasion with <b><i>Rubber Soul</i></b>,the first of their classic albums, and one that showed a newmaturity and complexity in songs like &quot;Norwegian Wood'' and&quot;Nowhere Man''. The accompanying single, &quot;DayTripper'', backed with the brilliant &quot;We Can Work It Out'',reinforced the image of a band working at the peak of theirpowers. </p><p>Yet <b><i>Rubber Soul</i></b> was merely the base camp for thepush that was to come, and following a final UK tour the bandtook three months off, relaxing and preparing for their nextwaxing. If <b><i>Rubber Soul</i></b> had opened minds, then <b><i>Revolver</i></b>,released in August 1966, was to blow them. As well as some of thefinest pop songs ever recorded, it also contained two tracks thatset out a manifesto for the psychedelic explosion of 1967.&quot;She Said She Said'', however lysergic, was at least a popsong, albeit one pushed to the limits; &quot;Tomorrow NeverKnows'', however, was something completely different. On top ofRingo's hypnotic drums and a kaleidoscope of tape loops, JohnLennon's mesmerizing vocal exhorted you to 'listen to the colourof your dreams'. It was the final delight on an album that tookin everything from George Harrison's bitter &quot;Taxman'', to&quot;Eleanor Rigby'' and the obligatory singalongaRingo track,&quot;Yellow Submarine''. Even the advance single,&quot;Paperback Writer'', was a corker, backed by&quot;Rain&quot;, The Beatles best ever B-side, propelled by yetmore innovative drum work from Ringo. </p><p>Ironically, at a time when The Beatles wereachieving new heights in the studio, they were packed off on ademoralizing world tour, which saw them physically assaulted inthe Philippines (for allegedly insulting Imelda Marcos), thenfacing demonstrations and death threats in the States, followingJohn Lennon's offhand remark that the band were now bigger thanJesus. Their last concert performance was at Candlestick Park inSan Francisco: on their return to the UK, they made it clear toBrian Epstein that touring was now off the agenda. Apart from thehassles and threats, they couldn't even hear themselves play overthe screaming, never mind attempt to reproduce the complexitiesof their new studio work. </p><p>With unlimited studio time available to them atAbbey Road, The Beatles set about topping their previous efforts.By this time, Lennon was so spaced out from the acid thatMcCartney had taken over as de facto leader of the group, but theold tensions in their relationship were pushing each other to newheights, as could be heard on their next double A-side single,&quot;Penny Lane''/''Strawberry Fields Forever''. Both wereregistered as Lennon and McCartney compositions, but the lazypsychedelic swirl of &quot;Strawberry Fields'' was as obviouslyLennon as the bouncy melody of &quot;Penny Lane'' was McCartney.Astonishingly, it was their first single since 1962 not to hitthe top slot: the great British record-buying public preferredEngelbert Humperdinck's ballad, &quot;Release Me''. The singlehowever, was merely a foretaste of The Beatles big statement, <ahref=~http://members.aol.com/jsweeney/pepper.htm~><b><i>SergeantPepper's Lonely Hearts' Club Band</i></b>. </a></p><p>If ever an album perfectly summed up the timesthis was it. Acid-drenched from start to finish, it was thedefinitive crystallization of the mood of 1967's Summer of Love.Though it had little real integrity as a concept album, bar theopening track and its reprise, the conceptual link was in thewash of echoed and reverbed sound, heavy with Harrison's Indianinstrumentation, underlaid by the wet tea-towel clump of Ringo'sdrums to stop the whole thing levitating off the turntable. Songslike &quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds'', &quot;With A LittleHelp From My Friends'' and &quot;A Day In The Life'' marked theculmination of five years of intense recording activity, but fromthese towering heights there could only be one direction - down. </p><p>The rest of the year was spent in a stonedreverie, although the hours of good-natured studioexperimentation did produce two classics in the form of &quot;AllYou Need Is Love'', broadcast live as Britain's contribution tothe first global satellite link-up, and Lennon's remarkable&quot;I Am The Walrus'', the product of a drug-twistedconsciousness imploding into adolescent psycho-goo. The recordingwas given extra emotional bite by being made only a few daysafter the suicide of Brian Epstein, a sobering shock amidst thelove and peace vibes of that hot, incense-scented summer. Withouthis leadership, The Beatles were left to their own devices, asituation that would lead to financial crisis in the followingyear and the ultimate collapse of group spirit. </p><p>In the immediate aftermath of Epstein's death,The Beatles decided to press ahead with The Magical Mystery Tour,a film project inspired by Ken Kesey's Merry Prankster's touringcoach and by the charabanc coach trips to Blackpool of theirLiverpool youth. The somewhat amateurish results were screened onBoxing Day to a hostile reception, though today it comes over asan engaging period piece. The Mystery Tour's destination turnedout to be a disused airfield at West Malling in Kent, where thememorable &quot;I Am The Walrus'' clip was filmed with fortydwarfs and a military band. </p><p>Early in 1968 The Beatles decamped to Rishikesh, to theMaharishi's meditation centre on the banks of the Ganges.Predictably, Ringo was the first to tire of the endless prayer,chanting and vegetarian curry, but Lennon and Harrison stuck itout for a full three months, before realizing that the Maharishiwas extremely attentive to the spiritual needs of his femaledevotees. Their stay might have ended in disillusionment, but itwas to prove extremely productive in songwriting terms. Freedfrom the entertainments of Swinging London, they had come up withenough material for a double album. </p><p>Back in London, they resumed work at Abbey Road and set aboutdeveloping Apple Corps, a company that was to handle all theircollective interests. As McCartney said, it was to be 'acontrolled weirdness . . . a kind of western communism'. AppleRecords launched with a bang on August 11, with &quot;Hey Jude'',one of the finest Beatles singles. Yet, despite this testament tooneness, The Beatles were starting to come apart at the seams. Ifthe demands of running a business weren't enough to contend with,John's relationship with Yoko Ono (who was now present at most oftheir recording sessions) was another source of friction, whichwas to boil over during the making of the new album, officiallycalled <b><i>The Beatles</i></b>, but more usually known as <b><i>TheWhite Album</i></b>. </p><p>Weeks of rancour culminated with the walk-out of Ringo, whowas of course persuaded to re-join, though the bad vibes refusedto go away. The album, however, was a fascinating display of thedifferent facets of the group, often in the form of soloperformances backed by the other three. As well as rockers suchas &quot;Back In The USSR'' and &quot;Helter Skelter'', <b><i>TheWhite Album</i></b> was stuffed full of more reflective gems like&quot;Dear Prudence'', &quot;Julia'' and &quot;Blackbird'', notto mention the complete one-off, &quot;Happiness Is A WarmGun&quot;. There was even a section of avant-garde <i>musiqueconcr&#143;te</i> in the form of &quot;Revolution No. 9'',perhaps the most skipped-over track on any Beatles album. </p><p>The recording of <b><i>The White Album </i></b>was such alengthy bad-tempered affair that it left the group completelyexhausted musically and close to breaking point. When the bandreconvened in January 1969 the idea of returning to liveperformance was seen as a panacea for the group's ills. Variousexotic venues were suggested before they settled on the idea offilming themselves rehearsing and recording a 'live' album/film,to be called <b><i>Get Back</i></b>, in a freezing film studio inTwickenham. The sessions were a disaster, with McCartney andHarrison at each other's throats, while the beatific John andYoko looked on dispassionately. Not even Ringo's good-naturedhumour could stop the rot. Fed up, Harrison walked out and thesessions ended in chaos. When everyone had calmed down, theyreturned to their Apple headquarters at Savile Row in the hope ofbetter vibes, but it was obvious that the magic had gone. Theystruggled on with a mixed bag of material, enlivened as ever bysome great songs, as well as the presence of organist BillyPreston. It was to be over a year, however, before theproceedings, edited down and controversially overdubbed by PhilSpector, was to reach the shops as the farewell album, <b><i>LetIt Be (1970)</i></b>. However, January did produce one legendaryperformance, on the rooftop of Apple, to the delight ofpassers-by. The band gave it their best shot, until the arrivalof the blue meanies put an end to the proceedings. It was to bethe last live Beatles show ever. </p><p>The Beatles story was more or less over, but despite theaggravation they couldn't face bowing out with the shambles of <b><i>LetIt Be (1970)</i></b>. Later in 1969, George Martin was astonishedto get a phone call from McCartney asking him to produce an album'the way we used to do it'. He responded cautiously, but the <b><i>AbbeyRoad</i></b> sessions proved to be astonishingly fruitful.Harrison contributed two of his best songs, &quot;Something'' and&quot;Here Comes The Sun'', and there was strong competition fromLennon's &quot;Come Together'' and from Paul, who contributedmost of the &quot;Long Medley&quot; on the second side. GeorgeMartin's immaculate touch at the controls gave a glittering sheento the whole set. </p><p>Such a return to form made the band's final break-up,announced by Paul McCartney on April 10, 1970, seem even morelike the end of an era. All four Beatles pursued solo careers:John with the <b><i>Plastic Ono Band</i></b> and <b><i>Imagine </i></b>albums,followed by a marked decline and disappearance into domesticityand drink; Paul with the less acclaimed but more commerciallysuccessful WINGS;George with a handful of albums followed by a steady career assideman; and even Ringo was dragged away from the bar to bang outa few sentimental favourites. There was regular speculation abouta reunion, but a decade of accumulated resentments and theByzantine legal actions that dogged the affairs of Apple made itdifficult to get all four in the same room together. </p><p>The final blow was the slaying of John Lennon in December1980. A reunion had been unlikely, but now it was impossible - orwas it ? Come Christmas 1995 and the eerie strains of &quot;FreeAs A Bird'' echoed around the Top 10 as John, Paul, George andRingo were brought together by modern technology. Where they hadonce burst tunefully out of your radio, now they were adirge-like memento mori, cynically promoting a nostalgiccollection of inessential out-takes for baby boomers. In trueBeatles style, &quot;Free As A Bird&quot; summed up the 90s'zeitgeist as perfectly as their original music had reflected theinnocent joys of the 60s. In the last few years, Apple's threevolume &quot;<b><i>Anthology</i></b>&quot; series, to accompanythe television history of the band, has collected rarities,alternative mixes, demos and outtakes, plus the occasionalunreleased track from the Beatles' archive. The first two in theseries sold some fourteen million copies, and the third looks setto match their performance. </p><br><p><b>Please Please Me </b>(1963; Parlophone). Captures the Fab Four in their first rush of glory.14 tracks bashed out in 13 hours, from the rocking wildness of&quot;I Saw Her Standing There'' to the climactic &quot;Twist AndShout''. Naive and brilliant. </p><p><b>With The Beatles</b> (1963; Parlophone). The Fabs are still recognizably a Mersey Beat combo,but with talent to burn and a new level of refinement.Stand-outs: &quot;All My Loving'', &quot;Roll Over Beethoven''and &quot;Money''. </p><p><b>Help!</b> (1965; Parlophone). Not a particularly coherent album, but a greatcollection of tunes, including their most covered number,&quot;Yesterday''. </p><p><b>Rubber Soul</b> (1965; Parlophone). The first of a hat trick of classics, with a soundworld that takes in everything from George Harrison's sitarexperiments on &quot;Norwegian Wood'' to the Euro-sophisticationof &quot;Michelle'' and &quot;Girl''. </p><p><b>Revolver </b>(1966; Parlophone). Arguably The Beatles' best, this explosion ofexcellence pits classic pop against the metallic drone of theemerging psychedelia. Who else would have the nerve to prefacethe tortured self-examination of &quot;She Said She Said'' with&quot;Yellow Submarine''? </p><p><b>Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts' Club Band</b> (1967; Parlophone). The Summer of Lovecaptured for eternity on magnetic tape. A kaleidoscope ofpsychedelic delights: but after all the fun and games, thehaunting climax, &quot;A Day In The Life'', still sounds like theend of the world. </p><p><b>The White Album</b> (1968; Apple). A sprawling double album of many moods, and even theup-beat numbers have an undertow of fragmentation. Lacks thepolish of most of the other Beatles records, but makes up for itwith the individual strands of brilliance - including George'sbest outing, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. </p><p><b>Abbey Road </b>(1969; Apple). Designed as the Beatles' swansong, <b><i>Abbey Road</i></b>doesn't disappoint. There's &quot;Come Together'' from John,&quot;Something'' from George, &quot;Golden Slumbers'' from Pauland &quot;Octopus's Garden'' from lovable Ringo. All given asmooth once-over from George Martin. </p><p><b>Let It Be </b>(1970; Apple). Not the way to go, sure, but any record with &quot;Let ItBe&quot;, &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, &quot;The Long andWinding Road&quot; and &quot;Get Back&quot; retains at least fourstakes to essential status. </p><p><b>Beatles 1963-1966</b> (1970; Parlophone). Superbly chosen compilation of singles andalbum cuts, charting The Beatles' journey into the nationalpsyche. The effect of their seemingly inexorable progression isbreathtaking. </p><p><b>Beatles 1967-1970 </b>(1970; Parlophone). The other definitive collection, but this timefollowing the journey from the psychedelic splendours of&quot;Strawberry Fields Forever'' to the resigned reflections of&quot;The Long And Winding Road''. </p><br><p><b><i>Iain Smith</i></b> </p><br>",

Only five months before, the group released the joyous A Hard Day's Night. Now, they sound beaten, worn, and, in Lennon's case, bitter and self-loathing. His opening trilogy (~No Reply,~ ~I'm a Loser,~ ~Baby's in Black~) is the darkest sequence on any Beatles record, setting the tone for the album. Moments of joy pop up now and again, mainly in the forms of covers and the dynamic ~Eight Days a Week,~ but the very presence of six covers after the triumphant all-original A Hard Day's Night feels like an admission of defeat or at least a regression. (It doesn't help that Lennon's cover of his beloved obscurity ~Mr. Moonlight~ winds up as arguably the worst thing the group ever recorded.) Beneath those surface suspicions, however, there are some important changes on Beatles for Sale, most notably Lennon's discovery of Bob Dylan and folk-rock. The opening three songs, along with ~I Don't Want to Spoil the Party,~ are implicitly confessional and all quite bleak, which is a new development. This spirit winds up overshadowing McCartney's cheery ~I'll Follow the Sun~ or the thundering covers of ~Rock & Roll Music,~ ~Honey Don't,~ and ~Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!,~ and the weariness creeps up in unexpected places -- ~Every Little Thing,~ ~What You're Doing,~ even George's cover of Carl Perkins' ~Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby~ -- leaving the impression that Beatlemania may have been fun but now the group is exhausted. That exhaustion results in the group's most uneven album, but its best moments find them moving from Merseybeat to the sophisticated pop/rock they developed in mid-career.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

This covers the late '50s to the end of 1964, mixing studio outtakes, live performances, primitive recordings from the Quarrymen/Silver Beatles days, excerpts from the famous 1962 Decca audition, the most notable 1961 Tony Sheridan-era recordings, and brief spoken bits from interviews. Although this material is undeniably of vast historical importance, it can't be placed in the same company as the Beatles' proper albums, in either cohesion or quality. While the studio outtakes (many never even heard on bootleg) are the most enticing items, these are almost exclusively alternate versions of songs they placed on their official releases (the most notable exceptions being the 1964 R&B cover ~Leave My Kitten Alone,~ the 1962 demo ~How Do You Do It,~ and the unimpressive 1964 Harrison original ~You Know What to Do~). Sometimes the differences are quite interesting (a much more electric-oriented version of ~And I Love Her,~ for example), but the alternates also illustrate how the group were virtually unerring in selecting the best arrangement and take of their songs for the final versions. The pre-1962 items are sometimes taken from private rehearsal tapes of primitive fidelity and are really of archival value only. One could go on at great length about the many curiosities and finds unearthed by this compilation, but for most general consumers, two observations may suffice. It does not stand up to the Beatles' fully conceived albums (even Live at the BBC), but the Beatles' scraps and leavings are more interesting than over 95 percent of other performers' best work. By that standard, this must be judged a worthwhile collection, especially (but not solely) for dedicated Beatles fans.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>All the rules fell by the wayside with Revolver, as the Beatles began exploring new sonic territory, lyrical subjects, and styles of composition. It wasn't just Lennon and McCartney, either -- Harrison staked out his own dark territory with the tightly wound, cynical rocker ~Taxman~; the jaunty yet dissonant ~I Want to Tell You~; and ~Love You To,~ George's first and best foray into Indian music. Such explorations were bold, yet they were eclipsed by Lennon's trippy kaleidoscopes of sound. His most straightforward number was ~Doctor Robert,~ an ode to his dealer, and things just got stranger from there as he buried ~And Your Bird Can Sing~ in a maze of multi-tracked guitars, gave Ringo a charmingly hallucinogenic slice of childhood whimsy in ~Yellow Submarine,~ and then capped it off with a triptych of bad trips: the spiraling ~She Said She Said~; the crawling, druggy ~I'm Only Sleeping~; and ~Tomorrow Never Knows,~ a pure nightmare where John sang portions of the Tibetan Book of the Dead into a suspended microphone over Ringo's thundering, menacing drumbeats and layers of overdubbed, phased guitars and tape loops. McCartney's experiments were formal, as he tried on every pop style from chamber pop to soul, and when placed alongside Lennon's and Harrison's outright experimentations, McCartney's songcraft becomes all the more impressive. The biggest miracle of Revolver may be that the Beatles covered so much new stylistic ground and executed it perfectly on one record, or it may be that all of it holds together perfectly. Either way, its daring sonic adventures and consistently stunning songcraft set the standard for what pop/rock could achieve. Even after Sgt. Pepper, Revolver stands as the ultimate modern pop album and it's still as emulated as it was upon its original release.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>With Revolver, the Beatles made the Great Leap Forward<p>, reaching a previously unheard-of level of sophistication and fearless experimentation. Sgt. Pepper, in many ways, refines that breakthrough, as the Beatles consciously synthesized such disparate influences as psychedelia, art-song, classical music, rock & roll, and music hall, often in the course of one song. Not once does the diversity seem forced -- the genius of the record is how the vaudevillian ~When I'm 64~ seems like a logical extension of ~Within You Without You~ and how it provides a gateway to the chiming guitars of ~Lovely Rita.~ There's no discounting the individual contributions of each member or their producer, George Martin, but the preponderance of whimsy and self-conscious art gives the impression that Paul McCartney is the leader of the Lonely Hearts Club Band. He dominates the album in terms of compositions, setting the tone for the album with his unabashed melodicism and deviously clever arrangements. In comparison, Lennon's contributions seem fewer, and a couple of them are a little slight but his major statements are stunning. ~With a Little Help From My Friends~ is the ideal Ringo tune, a rolling, friendly pop song that hides genuine Lennon anguish, à la ~Help!~; ~Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds~ remains one of the touchstones of British psychedelia; and he's the mastermind behind the bulk of ~A Day in the Life,~ a haunting number that skillfully blends Lennon's verse and chorus with McCartney's bridge. It's possible to argue that there are better Beatles albums, yet no album is as historically important as this. After Sgt. Pepper, there were no rules to follow -- rock and pop bands could try anything, for better or worse. Ironically, few tried to achieve the sweeping, all-encompassing embrace of music as the Beatles did here.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

This makes for a frustratingly scattershot record or a singularly gripping musical experience, depending on your view, but what makes the so-called White Album interesting is its mess. Never before had a rock record been so self-reflective, or so ironic; the Beach Boys send-up ~Back in the U.S.S.R.~ and the British blooze parody ~Yer Blues~ are delivered straight-faced, so it's never clear if these are affectionate tributes or wicked satires. Lennon turns in two of his best ballads with ~Dear Prudence~ and ~Julia~; scours the Abbey Road vaults for the musique concrète collage ~Revolution 9~; pours on the schmaltz for Ringo's closing number, ~Good Night~; celebrates the Beatles cult with ~Glass Onion~; and, with ~Cry Baby Cry,~ rivals Syd Barrett. McCartney doesn't reach quite as far, yet his songs are stunning -- the music hall romp ~Honey Pie,~ the mock country of ~Rocky Raccoon,~ the ska-inflected ~Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,~ and the proto-metal roar of ~Helter Skelter.~ Clearly, the Beatles' two main songwriting forces were no longer on the same page, but neither were George and Ringo. Harrison still had just two songs per LP, but it's clear from ~While My Guitar Gently Weeps,~ the canned soul of ~Savoy Truffle,~ the haunting ~Long, Long, Long,~ and even the silly ~Piggies~ that he had developed into a songwriter who deserved wider exposure. And Ringo turns in a delight with his first original, the lumbering country-carnival stomp ~Don't Pass Me By.~ None of it sounds like it was meant to share album space together, but somehow The Beatles creates its own style and sound through its mess.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

(The rest of the album was filled out with ~Yellow Submarine,~ ~All You Need Is Love,~ and a George Martin score.) What's more, two of the four new tracks were little more than pleasant throwaways that had been recorded during 1967 and early 1968. These aren't all that bad; ~All Together Now~ is a cute, kiddie-ish McCartney singalong, while ~Hey Bulldog~ has some mild Lennon nastiness and a great beat and central piano riff, with some fine playing all around -- each is memorable in its way, and the inclusion of the Lennon song here was all the more important, as the sequence from the movie in which it was used was deleted from the original U.S. release of the movie (which had no success whatever in the U.K. and quickly disappeared, thus making the U.S. version the established cut of the film for decades. George Harrison's two contributions were the more striking of the new entries -- ~Only a Northern Song~ was a leftover from the Sgt. Pepper's sessions, generated from a period in which the guitarist became increasingly fascinated with keyboards, especially the organ and the Mellotron (and, later, the synthesizer). It's an odd piece of psychedelic ersatz, mixing trippiness and some personal comments. Its lyrics (and title) on the one hand express the guitarist/singer/composer's displeasure at being tied in his publishing to Northern Songs, a company in which John Lennon and Paul McCartney were the majority shareholders; and, on the other, they present Harrison's vision of how music and recording sounded, from the inside-out and the outside-in, during the psychedelic era -- the song thus provided a rare glimpse inside the doors of perception of being a Beatle (or, at least, one aspect of being this particular Beatle) circa 1967. And then there was the jewel of the new songs, ~It's All Too Much.~ Coming from the second half of 1967, the song -- resplendent in swirling Mellotron, larger-than-life percussion, and tidal waves of feedback guitar -- was a virtuoso excursion into otherwise hazy psychedelia, and was actually superior in some respects to ~Blue Jay Way,~ Harrison's songwriting contribution to The Magical Mystery Tour; the song also later rated a dazzling cover by Steve Hillage in the middle of the following decade. The very fact that George Harrison was afforded two song slots and a relatively uncompetitive canvas for his music shows how little the project meant to Lennon and McCartney -- as did the cutting of the ~Hey Bulldog~ sequence from the movie, apparently with no resistance from Lennon, who had other, more important artistic fish to fry in 1968. What is here, however, is a good enough reason for owning the record, though nothing rates it as anything near a high-priority purchase. The album would have been far better value if it had been released as a four-song EP (an idea the Beatles even considered at one point, with the addition of a bonus track in ~Across the Universe~ but ultimately discarded).</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>As expected, the second installment of the Anthology series reflects the Beatles' increasing use of the studio-as-laboratory during their ~middle years.~ Some live material from 1965 to 1966 appears on the first disc, and the second ~reunion~ single (~Real Love~) leads off the set. But the emphasis is upon alternate takes from early 1965 to early 1968, during which time the group rapidly evolved from post-Merseybeat through folk-rock to psychedelia. As with the first volume, this is nearly always interesting but perhaps thinner on revelations than some might expect. The Help!-era outtakes ~If You've Got Troubles~ and ~That Means a Lot~ are on the light side but very fun, especially the latter, which Paul and the group perform much better than P.J. Proby (who covered the song shortly afterward). Some of the alternate takes are extremely different and excellent performances on their own merits: the funkier version of ~I'm Looking Through You~ and the less mellow arrangement of ~Norwegian Wood,~ a wall-of-drugs reverb for ~Tomorrow Never Knows,~ a very Byrds-like approach to ~And Your Bird Can Sing~ (with giggle-laden vocals), and an acoustic demo of ~Fool on the Hill.~ The earlier, much more acoustic version of ~Strawberry Fields Forever~ is the most notable gem. On the other hand, much of the material differs from the official cuts in fairly minute gradations and will be of greater interest to scholars than general listeners (although discoveries like a different solo on ~Penny Lane~ are fascinating). The seven live tracks on disc one, from the waning days of Beatlemania, are better than many would have assumed, showing the group still capable of generating heat on-stage.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>The final installment of the Anthology series has two discs of previously unreleased material from the White Album era through the group's demise in early 1970. In terms of sheer listenability, this may be the strongest volume of the three, if only because it focuses almost solely upon studio recordings rather than mixing live concerts/broadcasts and outtakes. Also, by this time the Beatles had perfected their approach to recording, meaning that even the early/alternate versions of many of their cuts were often of outstanding quality. There's some prime stuff here: ~unplugged~ White Album demos from mid-1968, radically different versions of ~While My Guitar Gently Weeps~ and ~Helter Skelter,~ a stringless ~The Long and Winding Road,~ three beautifully sung and played Harrison solo demos from early 1969, and several songs the Beatles never released, like ~All Things Must Pass,~ ~Not Guilty,~ ~Teddy Boy,~ ~Come and Get It,~ and ~Junk.~ Not everything here is so great that the casual consumer will be fascinated, of course. As on previous Anthology sets, some of these alternates are only very slightly different from the official versions; the oldies covers from the Let It Be era are off-the-cuff jams that aren't up to the group's usual level of brilliance. It's still a fascinating collection, both for the insight it affords you into the group's creative process at the end of their career, and for the considerable excellence of the music itself.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

If Vol. 2 is more eclectic than its predecessor, it isn't quite as thematically consistent, but it does hit greater highs with a greater frequency. Indeed, some of the greatest singles in pop history are here: ~Day Tripper,~ ~We Can Work It Out,~ ~Paperback Writer,~ ~Rain,~ ~Lady Madonna,~ ~Hey Jude,~ ~Revolution,~ ~Don't Let Me Down,~ and ~The Ballad of John and Yoko.~ All of the aforementioned are staples in the Lennon/McCartney canon, and while George Harrison's two contributions aren't as familiar, ~The Inner Light~ is arguably his best Indian excursion and ~Old Brown Shoe~ is a charmingly jaunty tune that points toward his solo career. In the middle of all this, single versions of ~Get Back~ and ~Let It Be~ appear (the former is stiffer than the LP version, the latter is better than its counterpart), along with the alternate (and superior) ~Across the Universe~ and the silly yet strangely irresistible ~You Know My Name (Look Up the Number).~ Overall, the compilation feels a little disjointed, mainly because it covers so much ground so quickly, but that takes nothing away from the quality of the music, since many of these songs rank among the best, most inventive recordings of the pop/rock era.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Jeff Beck's Truth -- which was already regarded as the pioneering heavy metal blues album of its era, beating Led Zeppelin to the punch by about six months -- got a lot better with this British import remastered reissue, which puts all prior editions of the CD to shame. EMI Records have remastered the original LP in 24-bit digital, which puts Beck's guitar and John Paul Jones' organ on ~You Shook Me~ practically in your lap, and the amp on the former almost up against your ear, and Mickey Waller's drums and Ron Wood's bass on ~Shapes of Things~ into a position of similar intimacy, so you can almost hear the action on the bass strings. And Rod Stewart's voice is not only close but flows out with a resonance that can't entirely be covered by his rasping delivery -- ~Ol' Man River~ now seems like an ideal choice for him (as well as a distant precursor to his later recordings of standards), and Keith Moon's timpani performance is totally larger-than-life here. Beck's guitar sounds like it's in the room with you on ~Rock My Plimsoul,~ and Stewart's singing is presented in such detail, that his nuances now seem fine and intimate. There are so many details revealed in the playing here in this remastering, that even longtime listeners are certain to find nuances in the playing and the different parts that are new to them -- and that's just the established album.</p><p>The original ten songs have been very judiciously augmented with a brace of killer bonus tracks, starting with ~I've Been Drinking,~ where Rod Stewart first treaded into Sam Cooke territory stylistically, which somehow never got included on the LP and ended up relegated to the B-side of the Beck single ~Love Is Blue~ in mono (it's in stereo here, natch); there's also the undubbed, stripped-down first take of ~You Shook Me,~ filled with instruments that are nice and close and crunchy (especially the guitar); the early, single-take of ~Rock My Plimsoul,~ remixed to stereo here; ~Beck's Bolero~ in its original mono single version; the previously unissued first take of the shattering ~Blues De Luxe~; and the early single A-sides ~Tallyman,~ ~Love Is Blue,~ and ~Hi Ho Silver Lining,~ the first and last featuring Beck's own singing (a decision imposed by producer Mickie Most over the guitarist's vociferous objections) the latter in its unedited form with a ~wee surprise~ at the very end. It's worth the upgrade -- you may well find yourself practically getting high off the raw invention and passions oozing from virtually all of the music, and even playing it once for some younger friends who've heard it before will make a few converts to its cause.</p>&mdash; <b>Bruce Eder</b>"

Released in 1975, Beck's fifth effort as a leader and first instrumental album was a marked departure from its more rock-based predecessors. Only composer/keyboardist Max Middleton returned from Beck's previous lineups. To Beck's credit, Blow by Blow features a tremendous supporting cast. Middleton's tasteful use of the Fender Rhodes, clavinet, and analog synthesizers leaves a soulful imprint. Drummer Richard Bailey is in equal measure supportive and propulsive as he deftly combines elements of jazz and funk with contemporary mixed meters. Much of the album's success is also attributable to the excellent material, which includes Middleton's two originals and two collaborations with Beck, a clever arrangement of Lennon and McCartney's ~She's a Woman,~ and two originals by Stevie Wonder. George Martin's ingenious production and string arrangements rival his greatest work. Beck's versatile soloing and diverse tones are clearly the album's focus, and he proves to be an adept rhythm player. Blow by Blow is balanced by open-ended jamming and crisp ensemble interaction as it sidesteps the bombast that sank much of the jazz-rock fusion of the period. One of the album's unique qualities is the sense of fun that permeates the performances. On the opening ~You Know What I Mean,~ Beck's stinging, blues-based soloing is full of imaginative shapes and daring leaps. On ~Air Blower,~ elaborate layers of rhythm, duel lead, and solo guitars find their place in the mix. Propelled by the galvanic rhythm section, Beck slashes his way into ~Scatterbrain,~ where a dizzying keyboard and guitar line leads to more energetic soloing from Beck and Middleton. In Stevie Wonder's ballad ~Cause We've Ended as Lovers,~ Beck variously coaxes and unleashes sighs and screams from his guitar in an aching dedication to Roy Buchanan. Middleton's aptly titled ~Freeway Jam~ best exemplifies the album's loose and fun-loving qualities, with Beck again riding high atop the rhythm section's wave. As with ~Scatterbrain,~ Martin's impeccable string arrangements enhance the subtle harmonic shades of the closing ~Diamond Dust.~ Blow by Blow signaled a new creative peak for Beck, and it proved to be a difficult act to follow. It is a testament to the power of effective collaboration and, given the circumstances, Beck clearly rose to the occasion. In addition to being a personal milestone, Blow by Blow ranks as one of the premiere recordings in the canon of instrumental rock music.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Mark Kirschenmann</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Released in 1976, Jeff Beck's Wired contains some of the best jazz-rock fusion of the period. Wired is generally more muscular, albeit less-unique than its predecessor, Blow by Blow. Joining keyboardist Max Middleton, drummer Richard Bailey, and producer George Martin from the Blow by Blow sessions are drummer Narada Michael Walden, bassist Wilbur Bascomb, and keyboardist Jan Hammer. Beck contributed no original material to Wired, instead relying on the considerable talents of his supporting cast. Perhaps this explains why Wired is not as cohesive as Blow by Blow, seemingly more assembled from component parts. Walden's powerful drumming propels much of Wired, particularly Middleton's explosive opener, ~Led Boots,~ where Beck erupts into a stunning solo of volcanic intensity. Walden also contributes four compositions, including the funk-infused ~Come Dancing,~ which adds an unnamed horn section. While Walden's ~Sophie~ is overly long and marred by Hammer's arena rock clichés, his ~Play With Me~ is spirited and Hammer's soloing more melodic. Acoustic guitar and piano predominate the closing ballad, ~Love Is Green~; Beck's electric solo gracefully massages the quiet timbres. Wired is well balanced by looser, riff-oriented material and Walden's more intricate compositions. Walden and Hammer give Wired a '70s-era jazz-rock flavor that is indicative of their work with the Mahavishnu Orchestra. Bascomb's throw-down, ~Head for Backstage Pass,~ finds Bailey skillfully navigating the mixed meters while Beck counters with a dazzling, gritty solo. Hammer's ~Blue Wind~ features an infectious riff over which Beck and Hammer trade heated salvos. As good as ~Blue Wind~ is, it would have benefited from the Walden/Bascomb rhythm section and a horn arrangement by Martin. One of Wired's finest tracks is an arrangement of Charles Mingus' ~Goodbye Pork Pie Hat.~ Beck's playing is particularly alluring: cleanly ringing tones, weeping bends, and sculpted feedback form a resonant palette. Bailey and Middleton lend supple support. Within a two-year span, the twin towers Blow by Blow and Wired set a standard for instrumental rock that even Beck has found difficult to match. On Wired, with first-rate material and collaborators on hand, one of rock's most compelling guitarists is in top form.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Mark Kirschenmann</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Jeff Beck has never shied away from following trends, at least as far as the musical styles he uses to back up his signature guitar sound. Back in 1969, in a sleeve note on Beck-Ola, he noted that he hadn't come up with ~anything totally original,~ and instead made an album ~with the accent on heavy music~ at a time when the ~heavy music~ of the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Led Zeppelin was all the rage. In 1975, at the height of the jazz fusion movement, he made a jazz fusion album, and a good one, too. In both cases, however, the fashionable genres only provided a contemporary-sounding context in which his playing could flourish. If anyone has ever needed to be inspired to work, it's this recluse. So on his first regular studio album of new material in ten years, Who Else!, Beck, on at least a few tracks, solos over heavily percussive techno tracks reminiscent of Prodigy. But whether he's piercing such a rhythmic wall, rearranging the blues on the live ~Blast From the East,~ or floating over an ambient soundscape on ~Angel (Footsteps),~ it's the same old Beck, with his stinging and sustained single-note melodies, his harmonics, his contrasting tones, his drive. And the man who played ~Greensleeves~ straight on Truth in 1968 is the same one who is faithful to the Irish air ~Declan~ here. Older fans who haven't been spending time at raves in recent years may want to program their CDs to avoid the electronica, but they should at least give those tunes a listen -- are they any heavier than the ~heavy music~ of 1969?</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Jeff Beck returns two years after the ten-years-in-the-making Who Else?, and You Had It Coming isn't surprising just for its rapidity, but for its music. From the moment the electronicized, post-rave beats of ~Earthquake~ kick off the record, it's clear that Beck isn't content to stay in place -- he's trying to adapt to the modern world. To a certain extent, this isn't an entirely new phenomenon, since each of his records is clearly, inextricably of its time, from the crunching metal of Truth through the breezy jazz fusion of Blow By Blow to the modernized album rock of Guitar Shop. This is just another side of that, as Beck works with electronic music, both noisy and new age introspective. It's a bit clever, actually, since Beck's playing has always been otherworldly, dipping, bending, and sounding like anything other than a normal guitar. The problem is, when he's surrounded by lockstep, processed beats and gurgling synths, his guitar doesn't leap to the forefront and capture attention the way it does on his best recordings. Still, there's something to be said for the effort, because even if it doesn't sound like a Beck record, it isn't a bad record, and it's certainly a helluva lot more successful than Clapton's similar forays into these waters. Besides, knowing that he knocked this out so quickly makes it a little endearing.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Anyone who caught Jeff Beck's set at Eric Clapton's 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival (or even the two-song DVD excerpt) was probably salivating at the hope that an entire performance with the same band would appear on CD and DVD. This is it, 72 minutes and 16 tracks compiled from a week of shows at the U.K.'s famed Ronnie Scott's, and it's as impressive as any Beck fan would expect. The guitarist's last official U.S.-released live disc was from his 1976 Wired tour (an authorized ~bootleg~ of his 2006 tour with bassist Pino Palladino is available at gigs and online; others pop up as expensive imports), making the appearance of this music from just over three decades later a long-awaited, much-anticipated event.</p><p>Only one track, the frenzied ~Scatterbrain,~ is repeated here from the 1976 album, but with an entirely different, and arguably more sympathetic, band backing him along with a far longer playing time, this disc is the stronger of the two. Veteran drummer Vinnie Colaiuta nimbly keeps the beat, Jason Rebello's keyboards aren't nearly as intrusive as Jan Hammer's, and young bassist Tal Wilkenfeld's rubbery lines both underpin and, in the case of ~Cause We've Ended as Lovers,~ take the lead when called on with vibrant proficiency and a sure sense of the bottom end needed for Beck's excursions into funk, fusion, reggae, jazz, and rock. The entirely instrumental concert focuses predominantly where you'd expect it to -- on Beck's innovative leads as he tears into his catalog of fusion fare, going back to Blow by Blow, with a surprise opening of ~Beck's Bolero~ from his Jeff Beck Group rock years. A short rendition of Charles Mingus' ~Goodbye Pork Pie Hat~ that segues into a tense ~Brush with the Blues~ is a disc highlight, as it shows Beck pulling out many of his six-string tricks and taps into his blues background. ~Space Boogie~ gives drummer Colaiuta a chance to shine with double-speed licks, and affords keyboardist Rebello a spotlight for his jazz piano skills. But it's Beck who slams into the track with aggressive fluidity, shooting out sizzling solos as the band pushes him along. His sensitive cover of the Beatles' ~A Day in the Life,~ a longtime live staple, is a showstopper bringing Beck's intensity to an arrangement that has stops, starts, and unexpected turns and is, like the guitarist, never predictable. Through it all, Beck's guitar sings, cries, moans, and shouts with as much emotion as a vocalist, showing that an instrument can sing as effectively as a human being, but only in the right hands.</p> <p>&mdash;Hal Horowitz</p>"

		"name": "Norman Blake",
		"biography": "<p>Although he is proficient with a variety of stringed instruments, Norman Blake is famous for his acoustic guitar skills -- he was one of the major bluegrass guitarists of the '70s. Blake came into view in the late '60s, when he began performing as a sideman with artists as diverse as June Carter and Bob Dylan. During the '70s, he began a solo career that quickly became one of the most popular and musically adventurous within bluegrass. He continued recording and performing -- occasionally with his wife, Nancy -- well into the '90s. Blake began playing music professionally when he was 16 years old, joining the Dixieland Drifters as a mandolinist in 1954; the group debuted on Tennessee Barn Dance, a radio show based in Knoxville. After two years, he left the band and became a member of the Lonesome Travelers, which was led by banjoist Bob Johnson. By the end of the '50s, the Lonesome Travelers had added a second banjoist, Walter Forbes, and had made two records for RCA. Although he joined Hylo Brown & the Timberliners in 1959, Blake continued to perform with Johnson. The following year, he also became a member of June Carter's touring band.</p><p>In 1961, Blake was drafted into the Army, and was stationed in Panama. While in the service, he was a radio operator on the Panama Canal and formed a band called the Kobbe Mountaineers. The band became a popular attraction and was voted the best band in the Caribbean Command. In 1962, Blake recorded Twelve Shades of Bluegrass with the Lonesome Travelers while he was on leave. He was discharged from the Army the following year and moved to Nashville, where he joined Johnny Cash's band. That same year, he married Nancy Short and settled in Chattanooga, Tennessee. For the next few years he played with Cash, both on recordings and concerts. In 1969, Bob Dylan hired Blake to play on his country-rock album Nashville Skyline, providing the guitarist with a whole new audience. That audience expanded even further when he became Cash's main guitarist on the singer's television show. Cash's program featured a wide array of musical guests, who were often impressed with Blake's talents. Kris Kristofferson asked him to join his touring band and Norman did so, playing both guitar and Dobro; he also played on several of Kristofferson's records. Blake also played on several of Joan Baez's records, including her hit version of ~The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.~</p><p>Following his folk and country-rock experiments, Blake returned to his bluegrass roots in 1971 when he joined John Hartford's band Aeroplane, which also featured fiddler Vassar Clements. Aeroplane fell apart quickly, but Blake stayed with Hartford for a year and a half. In 1972, Norman recorded his first solo album, Back Home in Sulphur Springs, which began a long relationship with Rounder Records. This arrangement lasted through Blake's 1990 album Norman Blake and Tony Rice 2, a follow-up to an earlier collaboration with Tony Rice. Most of Blake's output in the '90s was released on the equally venerable Shanachie label, including 1999's Be Ready Boys: Appalachia to Abilene. Far Away, Down on a Georgia Farm arrived that same year, followed by Flower from the Fields of Alabama in 2001. Blake teamed up with Ukrainian fiddler/mandolin player Peter Ostroushko for 2002's Meeting on Southern Soil in February of the following year, with the compilation Old Ties arriving later that spring.</p><p>Norman and Nancy put out Morning Glory Ramblers in 2004 and Back Home in Sulphur Springs in 2006. Norman released Shacktown Road in early 2007, following it with Sleepy Eyed Joe in 2009. That same year saw the release of Rising Fawn Gathering, a reunion of sorts with Blake's early-'80s group the Rising Fawn String Ensemble, which had issued three albums for Rounder in the early '80s with James and Rachel Bryan. The new recording juxtaposed the group with Ireland's Boys of the Lough in a collection that showcased Southern folk music as it evolved from Celtic origins.</p><p>In 2011, Norman released Green Light on the Southern, a completely solo collection of traditional folk and country standards. He recorded solo again in late 2014. Wood, Wire & Words was his first collection of all-original material since 1974's Fields of November; it was issued by Plectrafone in January of 2015 and received a Grammy nomination for Best Folk Album of that year. The guitarist returned two years later with Brushwood Songs & Stories. It contained 19 originals, including two instrumental rags, two spoken word pieces, and 15 songs, two of which were co-written with wife Nancy, who also sang harmony on five tracks.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Kurt Wolff</strong></p>",

Originally released on Takoma in 1976, it was out of print for years before an overwhelming fan petition prompted a reissue of the album in 1999. The sound is marvelous and, as one would expect, there's a ton of fine flatpicking here, as well as a rare chance to hear Blake live and in his prime. Joined by then-wife Nancy on three cuts, Blake switches to fiddle for a few tunes, including the lovely ~Border Widow.~ His rendition of ~Nine Pound Hammer~ is one of the best on record, and equally great is a loose arrangement of ~Arkansas Traveler~ that finds a number of other half melodies and improvisations darting in and out. Some of these tunes turned up on previous and later studio albums; some he would never record again.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jim Smith</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Norman Blake had barely begun his solo career in 1977 when he recorded Blackberry Blossom. This album finds Blake's artistry already fully developed, with the material divided between traditional songs and instrumentals. All nine cuts feature Blake's nifty guitar and mandolin work, with occasional back up from Nancy Blake on cello. The album gets started with a Tin Pan Alley tune, ~Are You from Dixie?,~ an upbeat song that plays off the motif of the lonely Southerner away from his homeland and longing for a friendly face. On the oddly titled ~The Rights of Man Hornpipe~ Blake is backed by Nancy Blake on cello, creating something akin to flatpicking Baroque. When the cello is combined with the fiddle on ~D Medley,~ the sound comes much closer to a medium-paced Appalachian jig. The original ~Lonesome Jenny~ fits comfortably with the album's traditional material, drawing a portrait of the empty life of a woman who has been left a widow. This seven-minute portrait is filled with fascinating chord changes and tender lyrics. All of the songs on Blackberry Blossom are delivered in Blake's straightforward manner, both down-to-earth and emotive. It is perhaps easy to take an artist as uncomplicated as Blake for granted: he never seems to be going out of his way to impress the listener with fancy guitar licks or vocal hysterics. Instead, he imbeds himself in tradition, offering honest interpretations and fresh originals that are respectful of their roots. In this way, his true artistry grows each time the listener hears Blackberry Blossom.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Ronnie D. Lankford</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Blind Faith's lone album is often considered vivid proof as to why superstar collaborations simply don't work, but that is a little unfair -- in contrast to, say, Chess Records' various Super Blues releases, which stuck top musicians such as Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf together in awkward combos that they didn't really want to be part of, the guys in Blind Faith really were trying to work together on a long-term basis, and had an affinity for each other's work; the group just never had the time to evolve properly. And in retrospect, the album does have something to offer, including two songs that are touchstones of classic late-'60s rock: ~Can't Find My Way Home~ and ~Presence of the Lord,~ not to mention the bracing ~Sea of Joy.~ ~Had to Cry Today~ is also pretty effective, as is the Buddy Holly cover ~Well All Right.~ Still, for those who subscribe to conventional rock critic doctrine, it may seem a little strange that an album as muddied as Blind Faith was given this lavish Deluxe Edition, containing basically everything capable of being released that the group cut during these sessions. This expanded edition will not change any minds; just on principle, it may even sour some open-minded listeners who have a distaste for extended, seemingly endless jams; in the latter regard, anyone so inclined should probably skip all but the third track on the second disc entirely, since three of the four jams that comprise the nearly hourlong platter are the least interesting of the bonus materials, even if some moments work well -- Eric Clapton's electric guitar playing is always interesting, and when Steve Winwood's organ kicks in there's a fair degree of excitement, though not without a lot of meandering before and after.</p><p>But the bonus tracks appended to the basic album on the first disc -- which runs a whopping 75 minutes -- are a different matter. These include two previously unreleased versions of ~Sleeping in the Ground~ (the one on Crossroads is missing), an electric version of ~Can't Find My Way Home~ that's just about worth the price of admission, and ~Time Winds.~ If one compares this double-disc set to, say, The Layla Sessions triple-CD box, there's more here, if only because this group still had so many rough edges to work out that are worth a listen, whereas the completed Derek & the Dominos Layla album did, indeed, distill down the best of that band's work. With Blind Faith, there was still a lot of ground to cover musically, although ~Acoustic Jam~ will probably not be on too many listeners' playlists more than once or twice, except for some aspects of Eric Clapton's and Rick Grech's playing -- this track may be the earliest instance (albeit an unintended one, as it wasn't ever supposed to see the light of day) justifying the criticism that sometimes gets hung on Steve Winwood's multi-instrumentalist status, that he is a jack of all trades and master of none, because his piano playing here just isn't very interesting. The fact remains that -- even with these new tracks and the lavish presentation -- this is a muddled album, but like The Layla Sessions it's still a hell of a set for the dedicated, filled with unheard music, good liners, and beautiful packaging. Those who do love the album or the work of the musicians involved will not be disappointed by this, and may well find new moments of fascination in the best of the jams. [The two bonus tracks that appeared on the original late-'80s CD release of Blind Faith are not here, as it was subsequently discovered that they were Rick Grech demos that didn't involve the rest of the band.]</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"biography": "<p>Aurora ~Rory~ Block has staked her claim to be one of America's top acoustic blues women, an interpreter of the great Delta blues singers, a slide guitarist par excellence, and also a talented songwriter on her own account. Born and raised in Manhattan by a family that had bohemian leanings, she spent her formative years hanging out with musicians like Peter Rowan, John Sebastian, and Geoff Muldaur, who hung out in her father's sandal shop, before picking up the guitar at the age of ten. Her record debut came two years later, backing her father on The Elektra String Band Project, a concept album. She met guitarist Stefan Grossman, who, like her, was in love with the blues. The pair would often travel to the Bronx to visit Reverend Gary Davis, one of the greatest living bluesmen.</p><p>At the tender age of 15 Block left home, hitting the road in true '60s fashion and traveling through the South, where she learned her blues trade at the feet of Skip James and Mississippi John Hurt, her greatest influence, before ending up in Berkeley. It was there that she developed her slide technique (she uses a socket wrench as her slide), but she didn't record until 1975, when she released I'm in Love (a compilation of earlier material, The Early Tapes 1975-1976, appeared later). After two records for Chrysalis, she recorded the instructional How to Play Blues Guitar for Grossman's Kicking Mule label, and later moved to then-fledgling Rounder, with whom she enjoyed an ongoing relationship. She toured constantly, often playing as many as 250 dates in a year, which kept her away from her family -- she'd married and begun having children in the early '70s -- but developed her reputation as a strong, vibrant live performer, and one of the best players of old country blues in America.</p><p>In 1987 the best of Block's Rounder cuts were compiled on Best Blues & Originals, which, as it said, featured her interpretations of blues classics and some of her own material. Two of the tracks, released as singles in Belgium and Holland, became gold record hits. In addition to her regular albums, Block made a series of instructional records and videos, as well as a children's record, Color Me Wild. Although she had been performing for a long time, the plaudits didn't really begin until 1992, when she won a NAIRD Award for Ain't I a Woman, a feat repeated in 1994 and 1997. In 1996 she began winning W.C. Handy Awards, first for Best Traditional Album (When a Woman Gets the Blues), and in 1997 and 1998 for Best Traditional Blues Female Artist. In 1997 she was elected to the CAMA Hall of Fame, and in 1999 she received yet another Handy Award, for Best Acoustic Blues Album (Confessions of a Blues Singer).</p><p>Block continued to tour, although not as heavily as in earlier times, and she's often accompanied by her grown son Jordan Block, who also plays on her albums. She remained busy in the early part of the 2000s, releasing six albums, including a live recording. 2005's From the Dust drew raving critical reviews, as did 2006's The Lady and Mr. Johnson, an album that sees Block taking on select songs of her musical hero, idol, and biggest influence, Robert Johnson. A digital video disc, The Guitar Artistry of Rory Block, was issued in 2008.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Chris Nickson</strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>That Rory Block is an astonishingly capable blues artist has been evident for many years, but with this tribute to the legendary Eddie J. ~Son~ House Jr., her cache is elevated even further. The shifty and slinky flexible slide work of House, and his preachy, shout chorus style vocalizing is perfectly exemplified on his tunes by Block. What is wondrous is that Block loses nothing of her personal sound and identity, as if she is mystically channeling the acoustic blues icon through some higher powered means. Block's pure and simple solo persona is electrified through many of House's classic tunes and some well chosen others, and she does them all proud. Everyone will enjoy and appreciate her spot-on take of ~Death Letter,~ 12-bar train inspired ~Depot Blues~ featuring her immaculate slide guitar work, and the inspired devices, phrasings, and fervent singing on the energetic ~Preachin' Blues.~ ~Grinnin' in Your Face~ is perhaps the most beloved tune of Son House, the tale of two-faced, untrustworthy people she sings with a slight echo or reverb in her voice that is truly haunting. Tales of a bad luck lover on ~Jinx Blues~ is as deep and personal as authentic blues gets, while the back porch moanin' ~Low Down Dirty Dog Blues~ echoes the pre-Howlin' Wolf style House founded. Listeners need to be advised that Rory Block is not photocopying these songs as much as she is assimilating them with her own voice, but in the pure and unique original voicings Son House invented. The loping ~Country Farm Blues~ and signature tune ~Shetland Pony Blues~ show the extreme passion and depth Block feels in this music. There are asides away from the guitar/vocal approach, as overdubbed vocals on ~Dry Spell Blues,~ the more folksy ~I Want to Go Home on the Morning Train,~ or an occasional harmonica insert by John Sebastian add a little variety. A most highly recommended recording that easily stands next to her previously recorded tribute to Robert Johnson, Blues Walkin' Like a Man ranks among Rory Block's very best efforts in her long, satisfying career, and is a welcome reminder of how a handful artists like Son House truly revolutionized American music.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Michael G.

With two hit singles -- &quot;Soul Man&quot; (#14) and &quot;Rubber Biscuit&quot; (#37) -- the album was platinum by 1979. They toured occasionally, particularly to promote their 1980 film &quot;biography,&quot; <i>The Blues Brothers,</i> which grossed over $32 million in its first two months of release. They had further hits with covers of the Spencer Davis Group’s &quot;Gimme Some Lovin’&quot; (#18, 1980) and Johnnie Taylor’s &quot;Who’s Making Love&quot; (#39, 1980).

		"biography": "<p>Boine grew up in the small village of Gamehhisnjarga, past the Arctic Circle on the northern most tip of Norway.</p><p>The Norwegians call the area Karasjok, but she knows it as Sami-land. The Sami people, an indigenous race related to North American Indians and Eskimo tribes, were colonized by the Christian Scandinavians. Part Sami herself, the first music Boine heard was the psalm singing of the “Laestadian” movement, a fundamentalist Christian movement which a large part of the Sami population follows. Boine’s artistry is rooted in the Sami tradition and the folk music of Scandinavia’s northern culture, which ranges through Norway, Finland and Sweden. Boine struggled to find a cultural identity and present it in her work. “I was bitter and full of what I regarded as righteous anger. I have been through every possible stage to reach where I am today. At school, we learned that Sami culture and the Sami language were worthless. They were not worth preserving. Believe me when I tell you that I was ashamed of being a Sami” As a contemporary composer, Boine encompasses many musical genres and cultures in her work. Her music is a blend of expressive styles: jazz, rock, joik—the traditional Sami chant—and other ethnic styles from South America and Africa. A diverse group of musicians, Boine’s band members combine the sounds of bass, keyboards and guitars with the Sami and African drums, Indian flutes, the Peruvian charango (a small guitar) and an Arabic fiddle. Despite the global collection of instruments, the music is still solidly Norwegian and completely original.</p><p>Boine recounts being trapped between two different closed communities and ideologies. Raised in a strictly religious home, she says, “My father was a pious man. Dancing and singing with friends was absolutely out of the question. Girls were to be neither seen nor heard. That was the rule.” Missionaries demonized pre-Christianity Sami musical traditions.</p><p>When Boine first began performing, she met with resistance from her own people. She attributes this to her open rebellion against her inferior status both as a member of the Sami people and as a woman.</p><p>Originally, her music was pure, pointed protest against the constant repression and missionary fervor. On several occasions, she challenged the Norwegian Prime Minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, to deliver an apology to the Sami people on behalf of the Norwegian state.</p><p>When asked to perform at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Boine refused. “I don’t want to be used as an exotic decoration. At an event like that, it could easily happen.”</p><p>Commissioned by one of the major music festivals in Europe, Norway’s ”Vossajazz”, Boine’s fourth and latest album “Leahkastin” is not as much of a directed social commentary, but her voice and music are just as powerful. Boine received the equivalent of a Norwegian “Grammy” award for the album in February 1994.</p><p>Today, she represents both the Sami people and Norway all over the world. The majority of the Sami people regard her as one of their greatest ambassadors.</p>",

		"biography": "<p>Guitar mastermind Joe Bonamassa, a young player with the childhood dream of playing music similar to legends like Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, and Jimi Hendrix, was 22 when he inked a deal with Epic. Hailing from Utica, New York, Bonamassa could play the blues before he could drive a car. He first heard Stevie Ray Vaughan at age four and was instantly taken by Vaughan's high-powered playing. At age eight, he opened for B.B. King, and at age 12, he was playing regularly around upstate New York. It was soon thereafter that Bonamassa hooked up with the band Bloodline, which featured other musicians' sons: Waylon Krieger (Robby Krieger's son), Erin Davis (Miles Davis' drummer kid), and Berry Oakley, Jr. (son of the Allman Brothers bassist). Bloodline released a self-titled album, but Bonamassa wanted to move on. In summer 2000 he guested for Roger McGuinn on Jethro Tull's summer tour, later releasing his debut solo album, A New Day Yesterday. Produced by longtime fan Tom Dowd, the album marked a move toward a more organic and rock-sounding direction. He put together a power trio with drummer Kenny Kramme and bassist Eric Czar and hit the road to support the album.</p><p>Upon returning from the road, he hooked up with Dowd to record the muscular and sweeping studio disc So, It's Like That and released a document of the tour, A New Day Yesterday Live. The following year, Bonamassa put out Blues Deluxe, featuring nine cover versions of blues classics alongside three originals. The muscular You & Me appeared in 2006, followed by the more acoustic-tinged Sloe Gin in 2007. A year later, Bonamassa released the two-disc live album Live from Nowhere in Particular, followed in 2009 by The Ballad of John Henry. Late in 2009 he released the DVD Live from the Royal Albert Hall with guest spots from Eric Clapton and Paul Jones. In 2010, the guitarist released his first disc for the Premier Artists label, Black Rock, featuring a guest appearance by B.B. King. It was followed by the debut album from Black Country Communion, a blues-rock supergroup that put him in the company of bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes, drummer Jason Bonham, and keyboardist Derek Sherinian. Bonamassa, ever the overachiever, released his earthy Dust Bowl in March of 2011, followed by Black Country Communion's 2 in June and by his unique collaboration with vocalist Beth Hart on a searing collection of soul covers entitled Don't Explain in September.</p><p>In May of 2012, Bonamassa released Driving Towards the Daylight. The album reunited the guitarist with producer Kevin Shirley, who brought in Aerosmith's Brad Whitford to play rhythm guitar on the 11 tracks. Driving Towards the Daylight was a significant blues hit -- it topped the Billboard blues charts and debuted at number two on the overall British charts -- and Bonamassa didn't slow down. Early in 2013, he released a live CD/DVD set called An Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House and prepared SeeSaw, a studio album of classic covers with vocalist Beth Hart. SeeSaw was released later in 2013, and Bonamassa and Hart followed it up with Live in Amsterdam in March of 2014.</p><p><strong>&mdash; MacKenzie Wilson & Al Campbell</strong></p>",

In 2009, he named his seventh studio album The Ballad of John Henry after one of the most enduring tales in American folk music. The difference between these two songs should signal a great difference between the two albums and that's true, to a certain extent. The Ballad of John Henry is heavy on myth-making that translates to heavy guitars on several occasions, particularly on the epic six-minute title track, whose roiling minor-key riffs, orchestrations, and excursions into acoustic instruments are closer to prog than blues. While the rest of the record never gets as overblown as this, it shares similar thick sonics and a sober sensibility, an approach that treats Ike & Tina Turner's ~Funkier Than a Mosquito's Tweeter~ as sacred text and straightens out Tom Waits' ~Jockey Full of Bourbon.~ This sobriety means that The Ballad isn't a whole lot of fun -- when Bonamassa sings that he's ~Feelin' Good,~ it feels a bit like drudgery -- but this dogged approach does give the album some self-serious heft, adding the impression of weight that fits a record that feels like a summation of his strengths. His guitar and voice carry equal weight as he runs through SRV-styled slow blues, a shuffle or two, acoustic numbers, covers, and originals -- everything that he's dabbled with on previous albums is pulled together here, making for his most varied album and possibly his best, even if that heaviness means that it's not necessarily the easiest to enjoy.</p><strong>&mdash; Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong>"

King to guest on his eighth album Black Rock -- and if what you’re doing is good enough to rope B.B. in, there’s not much reason to change, so Bonamassa doesn’t tinker with his formula here, retaining a little of the folky undertow of The Ballad of John Henry, but with its remaining roots in a thick, heavy blues-rock more redolent of ‘60s London than the ‘50s Delta. Of course, Bonamassa has never shied away from his love of Brit-blues, even underscoring it with a good streamlined cover of Jeff Beck’s “Spanish Boots,” but he retains a healthy respect for all manners of classic blues, kicking out a Chicago groove on a cover of Otis Rush’s “Three Times a Fool,” reaching back to Blind Boy Fuller for “Baby You Gotta Change Your Mind” and ably replicating B.B.’s latter-day soul groove on a horn-smacked cover of Willie Nelson’s “Night Life.” Bonamassa has an ear for non-blues writers too, cherrypicking Leonard Cohen’s “Bird on a Wire” and John Hiatt’s “I Know a Place,” tying it all together with beefy lead lines, but the provocative moments on Black Rock are all self-penned, whether it’s the clattering stomp “When the Fire Hits the Sea,” the British folk lilt of “Quarryman’s Lament” and “Athens to Athens,” or the droning dramatic epic “Blue and Evil.” These are easily the most intriguing songs here, suggesting Bonamassa realizes that the familiar covers allow him to stretch out elsewhere, and while it might be interesting hearing him follow this path for a full album, what’s here on Black Rock is both satisfying and admirably, if reservedly, ambitious.</p><strong>&mdash; Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong>"

				"review": "<p>Joe Bonamassa is a guitar hero and a road dog -- the blues-rock crusher plays up to 200 shows a year, and it's significant that of the 15 albums he released between 2000 and 2012, four of them were live sets. When Bonamassa played the Beacon Theatre in New York City in November 2011, the marquee declared it ~the guitar event of the year,~ and something that important would certainly merit another live album, wouldn't it? Beacon Theatre: Live from New York is a hefty two-disc set that features plenty of Bonamassa's trademark guitar work, at once precise and bombastic and firmly rooted in the traditions of British blues, and for this show he had Paul Rodgers on hand to lend appropriately swaggering lead vocals to a pair of Free covers, ~Fire and Water~ and ~Walk in My Shadows.~ Two other guest singers pop up on this set: John Hiatt, whose craggy tone lends a welcome bit of texture to versions of two of his tunes, ~Down Around My Place~ and ~I Know a Place,~ and Beth Hart, who has collaborated with Bonamassa in the past and lends her voice to spirited versions of ~Sinner's Prayer~ and ~I'll Take Care of You.~ There's no arguing the technical skill of Bonamassa and his band (Carmine Rojas on bass, Rick Melick on keys, and Tal Bergman on drums), who perform with the accuracy of a Swiss watch, but some might question his taste -- there's nothing the least bit subtle about Bonamassa's big, burly sound, and the emotional shadings of these songs are pretty much trampled into the dirt by the end of disc one, while the presence of the guest stars unfortunately reminds listeners that Bonamassa's vocals are not on a par with his skills on the fretboard. But if you're already a convert, Beacon Theatre: Live from New York finds Bonamassa playing with all his might for a crowd who are clearly digging what he has to offer, and if, like many of his fans, you're convinced he sounds stronger and more powerful on-stage, this album will tide you over nicely until he next rolls into your area.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>"

In January 2015, Joe Bonamassa took the iconic Great Stage at Radio City Music Hall for the first time for a sold-out, two-night run that allowed him to fulfil his lifelong dream of performing in one of the world’s most legendary venues. These concerts were recorded, and will be released as  ‘Live At Radio City Music Hall’ on the 2nd of October.</p><p>The thirteen track CD kicks off with ‘I can’t be satisfied’ with a full backing band, consisting of bass player Carmine Rojas, keyboard player Reese Wyans, drummer Tai Bergman, a horn section with Lee Thormburg on trumpets, Nick Lane on trombone and saxophonist Paulie Cerra. Impressive to say the least.</p><p>‘One Less Cross To Bear’ (which you can download for free at the end of this review) is a new song, more of a break down played live as the rhythm section keep it nice and tight, allowing Joe’s guitar to sing until Reese Wyans lets loose with a glorious keyboard solo.  Not to be outdone, Tai Bergman and Lenny Castro join in with a percussion run. Glorious.<p>We then get all acoustic for Dustbowl, which is my current (out of many) favourite JB song and is played stripped down here.  It certainly shows another side to Joe’s playing, that he is in fact more than just “a blues player” he is in fact a great guitar player.</p><p>The great thing about Joe is that he is not afraid to experiment, to work with different people and styles, as witnessed on Joe’s half acoustic/half electric tour (of which these two shows were a part), in particular when he welcomed Irish fiddler Gerry O’Connor onto the stage for ‘Still Water’.</p><p>The title track from his last studio album ‘Different Shades Of Blue’ is equally as impressive and features a wonderful Nyckelharpa solo from Mats Wester.</p><p>The electric band is back for ‘Never Give All Your Heart’, out of an eerie opening section Joe’s guitar sound comes flying, soaring with melody and tone, truly an uplifting song if ever there was one.</p><p>A wonderful Reese Wyans intro for another new song, ‘So, What Would I Do’ brings the show to a close, featuring a great Paulie Cerra saxophone solo, Joe really does allow his fellow musicians a chance to shine.</p><p>With enough old material to keep the die-hards happy and enough new material to keep everybody else happy, this is much more than a live album, this is a life event.</p><p>The DVD contains all the songs as featured on the CD, plus a lot more besides, including over 2.5 hours of live footage, and a special 45-minute behind-the-scenes featurette.</p><p><strong>&mdash;David Farrell</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>‘Live at the Greek Theatre’ is Joe Bonamassa’s fourteenth live album and his tenth live album since 2012, the year in which Joe’s career (burnished by 2011’s remarkable ‘Dust bowl’) went into overdrive. Whereas such a quotient of live albums could seem an extravagance, with Joe, the live shows form an essential part of his catalogue. Each show is a chance to reinvent, and it is simply not in Joe’s nature to take the easy route and simply play the hits. Instead, Joe’s shows are an exploration in which he challenges himself and the audience, offering up radical reinterpretations (‘An acoustic evening at the Vienna opera house’), blistering hard-rock blues (‘Beacon Theatre – live from New York) and stunning tributes to great musicians (‘Muddy Wolf – Live at Red Rocks’). Of these, it is the latter – ‘Muddy Wolf’ – which proved unequivocally that a live album can be every bit as crucial as a studio record and, for SonicAbuse, the album was listed as one of the best records of 2015.</p><p>2016 has been no less a great year for Joe. March saw the release of the wonderful ‘Blues of Desperation’ yet, rather than simply tour the album, Joe went out on the road to celebrate a succession of inspirational blues artists. In the UK Joe paid tribute to three legends of British Blues: Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page, in an event that we described as ‘once in a lifetime’. Those concerts were filmed for posterity, but before that films sees the light of day, we are blessed with a recording of Joe’s special US tour in which the Three Kings – Freddie, B.B. and Albert – were celebrated. Joe handpicked each set and treats the music with respect whilst simultaneously making it over in his own unique style. Joe’s passion and enthusiasm for the blues drives the project, his remarkable talent on the guitar gilds it and his stunning band (“the greatest band in the world” Joe reminds us) polish it to a mirror shine. This is what all live recordings should be and it looks likely that Joe Bonamassa will have two albums in our end of year list this time around!</p><p>As with most Bonamassa releases, this is a multi-format release and fans can choose from double CD, double DVD, Blu ray and 3 LP editions. Our review copy is the double DVD, which features not only the performance itself (sensibly placed solely on disc one to minimize compression), but also a fistful of extras including Behind the scenes clips, an illuminating interview with Joe’s parents and a music video for ‘Riding with the kings’. Those who have purchased Bonamassa releases before will know that there’s a firm emphasis on quality and this release is no exception. Beautifully filmed in HD, the DVD looks as crisp and clear as it is possible for the format to look (and one can imagine that the Blu Ray looks yet better) and everything from the deep red of Bonamassa’s beautiful Gibson ES330 to the inky blacks of the backstage area are captured in impressive detail. Of course, whilst the image in important, it is the audio that is of paramount important and the disc does not disappoint. Mixed, as always, by Kevin Shirley there’s a choice of stunning DTS 5.1 mix and PCM 2.0. and, whichever mix you go for, it’s virtually impossible to fault. For the most part the music floods from the front speakers whilst the rears are used for subtle ambience which gives the music depth without appearing gimmicky. In other words, it’s yet another reference presentation from Joe and this is one disc you’ll want to break out a lot.</p><p>The film starts with a short introduction which captures a TV clip showing the thirteen-year-old Joe already making a name for himself as a guitarist. It’s an illuminating piece that considers that elusive question of authority within the blues, questioning the extent to which a young man with few troubles in life can relate to the blues. The clip leaves this down to the incisive B.B. King who simply says “You don’t know where the children get this from… but all I know is he got it!” One does not argue with the master and, by the end of this epic concert, it’s irrefutable that Joe not only has the blues, but that he has them bad. On stage it’s all too easy to see that thirteen-year-old boy, still dreaming of the stars and paying tribute to those that went before him in the only way he knows how, and it is proof that sometimes, in this dark world, dreams do come true.</p><p>In truth I sat down to review this DVD a few days ago, only to leave my laptop to one side whilst I simply sat and became absorbed. Some DVDs can leave you feeling cold, like you’re sat outside the window, looking in at a great party, but this does a fantastic job of placing you right at the heart of the action. From Kevin’s immersive mix to the well-edited shots that impeccably capture each musician on the somewhat crowded stage, Phillipe Klose has done a fabulous job of bringing it all together and deserves great credit for balancing the energy of the performance with a restraint that allows the camera to linger rather than jump cut in what has become an increasingly irritating style in live music video. From the moment that the smooth blues of ‘See see baby’ comes rolling in, augmented by the glorious brass arrangements of Lee Thornburg, it’s impossible to stem a rising feeling of joy driven by the music. That sense of euphoria only grows as Anton Fig’s rolling percussion announces the arrival of ‘some other day, some other time’ which is a perfect ensemble piece, capturing each musician in their element. What makes it so perfect is not the musicianship itself (impressive as it is), it’s the fact that these veterans are so obviously having the time of their lives playing this wonderful music and even though this is a recording, the emotion is so strong that you can’t help but be swayed by it. This is music of the heart and soul, and both Bonamassa and his band understand that all too well, delivering a performance that captures that very human essence of the blues. Things really start to cook with ‘sittin’ on the boat dock’ and ‘going down’, both of which crackle with enough energy to power the national grid. It’s a reminder that this is no ordinary concert, but a celebration of all that is wonderful in blues music, and if ‘Going down’ doesn’t make you want to leap from your seat and dance, then it is entirely possible that you need to seek medical advice regarding the operational capability of your adrenal glands.</p><p>With the crowd’s ecstatic applause ringing in the speakers throughout the introduction of the song, ‘I’ll play the blues for you’ takes things down a notch, as if any further displays like ‘going down’ would result in spontaneous combustion. Joe appears with Lucy, Albert King’s beautiful, vintage Gibson flying V, although it is second guitarist Kirk Fletcher to whom Joe graciously cedes the spotlight for some truly heroic soloing. Similarly, Reece Wynans (Keyboards) and the brass section get plenty of time to shine on ‘I get Evil’, although it is the sweet groove of ‘Breaking up somebody’s home’ (powered by Michael Rhodes) that serves as a stunning mid-set highlight with some of the feature’s most astounding soloing yet seen. Equally powerful is ‘Angel of mercy’, a hulking blues monster neatly paired with the sweet groove of ‘Cadillac Assembly line’ and so the set progresses, Joe once again showing that his gift of sequencing the sets for maximum impact has not deserted him. Very much an integral part of the show are singers Mahalia Barnes, Jade Macrae and Juanita Tippins, who add so much to the night and get a moment to shine with the glorious gospel harmonies of ‘Ole time religion’. Their presence sweetens even the darkest blues and they remain absolutely graceful even as Joe blazes away on his guitar on tracks such as ‘nobody loves me but my mother’. The set concludes with the classics ‘born under a bad sign’ and the evergreen ‘the thrill is gone’. It’s a poignant and beautiful tribute to Joe’s friend and mentor, B.B. King whose loss is still keenly felt by the entire blues community. It is also the perfect conclusion to a concert that does not put a single foot wrong over the course of twenty-two well-chosen tracks.</p><p>‘Live at the Greek theatre’ is a reference quality DVD/Blu Ray that allows viewers to watch one of the world’s greatest guitarists paying tribute to three of the Blues’ greatest artists alongside a band that is absolutely without equal. Joe Bonamassa does not have to do these tours. A respected and talented song writer, he could simply tour his hits and have done. These shows are special because they are a project born purely out of a love for the music and a gratitude for the inspiration that is quite impossible to counterfeit. From the start Joe’s heart and soul is on display and the connection he makes with the audience is glorious to behold. Not many artists can make a live recording so remarkable, but Joe’s performance here is so bold, impassioned and beautiful that this record (and its parent tour) will still be talked about in decades to come.</p>"

				"review": "<p>'British Blues Explosion Live' is the latest conceptual vehicle for the prodigiously talented Joe Bonamassa and his constant search for a meaningful context with which to keep the blues alive.</p><p>Playing to a seated outdoor crowd at The Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, he's probably playing to the very people who bought the original material and helped cross over blues into hard rock in the late 60's.</p><p>Where The Yardbirds exported the British Blues Invasion in the mid-sixties, little over 50 years later, Bonamassa is reversing the trend by recycling past glories, while adding his own colours in a reminder of how we came to this point musically.</p><p>Bonamassa's high standing in the rock/blues community is a result of the cleverly interweaving of his self penned material with that of salient British blues rockers.</p><p>His first half a dozen studio albums significantly drew on material by Rory Gallagher, Free, Ian Anderson, Beck and Stewart, Steve Winwood, Plant and Page, Alvin Lee and even John Martyn, so while his own song writing has grown significantly he's imperceptibly dragged the old Blues Invasion crowd with him.</p><p>This brings us to the 'British Blues Explosion Live', a double CD/DVD pack which finds Bonamassa indulging himself in personal favourites from as far back as 1966 with John Mayall's Blues Breakers' 'Little Girl', and as recently as Eric Clapton's 1989 'Pretending', on which he adds an eloquently layered solo.</p><p>Clapton would seem to be closest to his heart, but he sets out his stall with the fiery Jimmy Page penned 'Beck's Bolero', as he successfully emulates the latter's fiery intensity.</p><p>'Mainline Florida', mirrors Clapton's gradual conversion to the mainstream and the undoubted southern flavour is aided by the significant bv's of Russ Irwin.</p><p>Beck's 'Let Me Love You Baby' pushes Joe's vocal to the limit. He's smart enough not to attempt to emulate Rod Stewart's vocal grit on 'Plynth (Water Down the Drain)', but settles for exploring one of rock's greatest riffs which is well suited to his ability.</p><p>He's a precise player who is happiest when exploring concise notes and different tonal colours, rather than the strutting figure who tries manfully to reign in Zeppelin on 'How Many More Times.'</p><p>He immerses himself in Beck's 'Spanish Boots', and though the vocal is a bit thin he's got the safety net of Anton Fig's blustery support. He then reaches back to 1966 for Bluesbreaker Clapton's 'Double Crossing Time' which provides the most intense performance of the first set and reminds us that this really is the stuff that ignited a generation.</p><p>He eschews slide on Clapton's 'Motherless Children' and settles for a cleaner tone as he builds up a head of steam alongside Reese Wynans' organ.  Then there's a humorous contextual intro to Cream's 'SWLABR', as the camera cleverly shifts from a wide shot to a close up of Bonamassa building up the intensity of the younger Clapton's licks.</p><p>The crowd is too far away to make a meaningful connection with the performer, but he cleverly draws them in with the subtle dynamics on Zeppelin's 'Tea For One.'</p><p>Not too many folks could have anticipated the clever segueing of his own 'Black Winter' (a rehash of The Yardbirds 'White Summer'), and 'Django'. The latter instrumental personifies his intricate instrumental work and it provides the quiet before the storm.</p><p>Zeppelin's 'How Many More Times' is almost a step too far, as Joe is caught between his love of bone crunching riffs and the vocal gravitas needed to deliver both the original song and a few lines from 'The Hunter'.</p><p>Happily his ballistic finish does enough to spark the communal flashback that his audience subconsciously came here for. 'British Blues Explosion Live' offers few surprises, but Bonamassa's focussed intensity and peerless technique gives him the right to update the genre.</p><p>The bonus material includes some footage of a tired looking JB in a Cavern T-shirt playing a bluesy version of George Harrison's 'Taxman', which is ironically filmed in black and white.</p><p>There's also an ad-hoc 'Brick in the wall' ceremony outside The Cavern in Liverpool, which offers us a snapshot of the capped Bonamassa far removed from his usual working clothes of suit and shades.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Pete Feenstra</strong></p>"

		"biography": "<P>The role of the Arabic, lute-like, stringed instrument, the oud, has been revolutionalized through the playing of Anouar Brahem. While used in the past to accompany vocalists, the oud is used by Brahem as an imaginative solo instrument. In 1988, Tunisian newspaper, ~Tunis-Hebdo~, wrote, ~If we had to elect the musician of the 80s, we would have, without the least hesitation, chosen Anouar Brahem~. The British daily newspaper, ~The Guardian~, that Brahem was ~at the forefront of jazz because he is far beyond it~. <BR><BR>Encouraged by his music-loving father, Brahem began studying the oud, at the age of ten, when he enrolled at the National Conservatory of Music. For nearly a decade, he studied with influential oud player Ali Sitri. By the age of fifteen, he was playing well enough to perform regularly with local orchestras. Although he initially focused on Arabic music, Brahem increasingly incorporated elements of jazz. This was enhanced during the six years that he spent in Paris (1981 -- 1987), performing at festivals and collaborating with choreographer Maurice Bejart on a production, ~A Return To Carthage~ that received the prestigous ~National Award Of Excellence In Music~.</P><P>Returning to Tunis in 1987, Brahem performed at the Carthage Festival in the multi-artist production, ~Ligua 85~. Shortly afterwards, Braham agreed to become director of the Ensemble Musical De In Ville De Tunis. During the two years that he oversaw the ensemble, Brahem divided the group into smaller of various sizes. Among the productions that he directed were ~Leilatou Tayu~ and ~El Hizam El Dhahbi~. <BR><BR>In 1990, Brahem resigned to focus on his own career. After touring in the United States and Canada, he met and was signed by Manfred Eicher, producer and founder of German record label, ECM. His debut album, ~Barzakh~, released in 1991, was recorded with Turkish musicians, Bechir Selmi and Lassad Hosni. In a review of the album, German music magazine, ~Stereo~, wrote, ~(Brahem) is an exceptional musician and improviser~. Brahem's second album, ~Conte De L'incroyable Amour~, released in 1992, was recorded with clarinet player Barbaros Erkose. In 1994, Brahem recorded ~Madar~, with Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek and Pakistani tabla player Shaukat Hussain. Brahem's fourth album, ~Khomas~, released in 1995, featured improvised interpretations of his compositions for Tunisian film and theater productions and was recorded with accordion player Richard Galliano and violinist Bechir Selmi. With his fifth effort, ~Thimar~, released in 1998, Brahem collaborated with soprano saxophone and bass clarinet player John Surman and double bass player Dave Holland. <I>Astrakan Cafe</I> was issued three years later.</P><P>Brahem has composed numerous pieces for such films and musical theater productions as ~Sabots En Or~, ~Bezness~, ~Halfaouine~, ~Les Silences Du Palais~, ~Lachou Shakespeare~, ~Wannas El Kloub~, El Amel~, ~Borj El Hammam~ and ~Bosten Jamalek~. He collaborated with Maurice Bejart on the ballet, ~Thalassa Mare Nostrum~ and with Gabriel Yared on the Costa Gravas film, ~Hanna K~. </P>&nbsp; <B>Craig Harris</B> ",

				"review": "<p>The Tunisian oud genius has done it again. Anouar Brahem has issued only five records under his own name over the past decade, each more adventurous than the last, without compromising his original vision: for the music of his region to meet with the other music of Africa and Asia and create a delirious sound that is equal thirds past, present, and future, along the precipice of historical lineage. For Brahem there is no attempt to synthesize the globe, or even the sounds of the East with those of the West. He is content in his knowledge that sound is infinite, and that his tradition, as it evolves and expands into a deeper pan-African/trans-Asian whole, is more than large enough for a master musician to rummage through in one lifetime. Astrakan Café, the follow-up to his brilliant Thimar, is a smaller-sounding recording that reaches farther into the deep crags of the Balkans. With Barbaros Erköse on clarinet and the Indian and Turkish percussion stylings of the professor of somber precision, Lassad Hosni, Brahem's oud enters into a dialogue, musically, that has never before existed (though he has collaborated with both players previously). Erköse is a Turkish clarinetist of gypsy origin. His low, warm, rounded tones are consonant with the oud. Erköse plays equal parts music of the Balkan and Arab worlds with a tinge of the ancient klezmorim whispering their secrets through his horn. Despite the journeying these musicians do here, they never stray far from the takht, a small ensemble capable of improvising to the point of drunken ecstasy. Listening through Astrakan Café, you can hear the gypsy flamenco tied deeply to Indian ragas and even a kind of Eastern jazz. But there is no hyperactivity in it, no need to cram as many traditions as possible into one putridly excessive mix that expresses nothing but the novelty of the moment. Astrakan Café has many highlights: its two title tracks that have their roots in Russian and Azerbaijan music; ~Ashkabad,~ which is an improvisation on a melody from the folk music of Turkmenistan; ~Astara,~ a modal improvisation based on love songs from Azerbaijan; ~Halfounie,~ a segment from a Brahem-composed soundtrack inspired by the medina or marketplace in Tunis; and ~Parfum de Gitanie,~ which takes a fragment from Ethiopian sacred music, slows it to the point of stillness, and waxes lazily and jazzily over the top, with the oud and the clarinet trading syncopated eights. This is deeply personal, profound music. It is also highly iconographic, with timelessness woven through every measure. The only ~exotica~ on Astrakan Café is its ~otherness~ out of space and any discernable era. The tempos are languid and full of purpose, the dynamics clean and clearly demarcated, the tones and modes warm, rich, and linear. This would be traditional music if a tradition such as this -- which is original, though adapted from many sources on inspiration -- actually existed. Highly recommended</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

The interplay between musicians is as delicate as lace -- thoughtful, with everyone listening as much as playing. It's a record with many moments of great beauty, like the exquisite piano on ~C'est Ailleurs~ or the filigree touches between accordion and piano that decorate and nudge along many of the tracks. Brahem is a superb, if reserved, musician, as are his colleagues: Francois Couturier on piano and Jean-Louis Matinier on accordion.

				"review": "<P>Over the past 15 years, Tunisian oud master Anouar Brahem has assembled a relatively small but profound body of work. A skilled improviser who refuses to be part of the historical authenticity argument, Brahem works from the same trio setting that performed on Le Pas du Chat Noir in 2002, with pianist François Couturier and accordionist Jean-Louis Matinier. The dialogue between these players is, despite the sparseness of the music and the considerable space employed, intense. The deep listening necessary in the improvised sections allows for a natural flow of ideas to emerge from silence. The compositions themselves are skeletal, with repeating, slowly evolving vamps and lyric lines. They offer, on the surface, a contemplative approach, and indeed can be heard that way. However, when dynamics, timbre, and chromatics are listened for, what takes place is rather astonishing. Each player walks to the middle of a composition, steps back and reenters after ideas by the others are introduced, producing a kind of organic improvisation seldom heard. This is not to say that the most structured works here, such as ~Vague/E la Nave Va,~ aren't full of meditative delight as well. They are, and there are vast spaces into which the listener can enter and disappear for a while -- not so much to drift and dream as to be absorbed in their hypnotic and repetitive beauty. ~Les Jardins de Ziryab~ begins with Matinier's accordion, which is answered by the oud and Brahem's voice, accompanying them both. It unfolds from the center out. ~Le Chambre, Var.~ begins, for this ensemble, at a trot. Couturier's chord voicing and Brahem's percussive approach create a winding musical narrative that Matinier's accordion underscores rhythmically. The keyboard and air pulse create a terrain where intricate melodic lines come out of modal and chromatic tensions. Ultimately, Brahem has given listeners another of his wondrous offerings, full of deceptively simple compositions that open into a secret world, one where beauty is so present that it is nearly unapproachable, and it is up to the listener to fill in the spaces offered them by this remarkable trio.</P>— <B>Thom Jurek</B>"

When Tyner himself plays on ~Song for Bilbao~ (one of two guest appearances), one can certainly tell the difference between master and pupil.

Larry Goldings' organ makes for an unusual quartet -- also including Brecker on tenor sax, frequent guest Pat Metheny on guitar, and one of three different drummers -- in that there is no bass. As a result, Metheny often fills in that role when he isn' t soloing. Goldings' touch is light, in contrast to the more intense playing of Brecker and Metheny. But it is the second new sideman who makes a difference: Elvin Jones guests on drums on three tracks. Brecker had never shied away from announcing his influences, and with Jones behind the traps, especially on the opening track, ~Arc of the Pendulum,~ and the closer, ~Outrance~ (both Brecker originals), he indulges his affection for John Coltrane, playing freely and aggressively across the rhythm. Jones, who gets a showcase solo in ~Outrance,~ is unmistakable, and his support often makes Brecker sound like Coltrane. With Bill Stewart behind the drums, the group performs ~Renaissance Man,~ a tribute to another major Brecker influence, Eddie Harris, and Brecker unabashedly recalls Harris there. The tunes, five by Brecker, two by Metheny, and one each by Goldings and producer George Whitty, are loosely structured and run from six to ten minutes each, so that the disc runs 70 minutes. Clearly, they could have gone longer: Several of them fade out, sometimes during a Brecker or Metheny solo, an oddity on a jazz album.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Brecker has updated these great songs with the addition of Pat Metheny's excellent production prowess on such great ballads as Joe Zawinul's ~Midnight Mood~ and the Kurt Weill-Ira Gershwin standard ~My Ship.~ ~Midnight Mood~ is sensual and seductive, complete with a blithe piano solo by Herbie Hancock in the middle section.

James Taylor sings one of the best renditions of his ~Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight,~ and it's clearly due to the excellent musicians on this CD. Pat Metheny excels as a serious jazz artist with his well thought out treatment of ~Nascente,~ which was inspired by Gil Evans' classic 1948 arrangement for Miles Davis on Miles Ahead.

The idea of the sold-out tour was to pay tribute to Miles Davis and John Coltrane, or, more specifically, to honor their creative spirit.

For an extended listen to Brecker and Hargrove, however, you can't beat ~So What/Impressions,~ a Davis/Coltrane mélange. The song opens with Patitucci working a cool little one-minute bass solo, and then Hargrove and Brecker assay a joint thematic statement. Hargrove then steps off into a sparsely phrased solo (indeed a bit reminiscent of Miles), pushing the amplitude of his sound and piling up notes with amazing agility. Brecker answers Hargrove with a tenor sax solo that gets loose very quickly and holds a nervy edge for the duration, eventually achieving a stuttering angularity that returns the quintet to the melody line.</p><p>Brecker's seven-and-a-half minute, unaccompanied solo on ~Naima~ is sheer tenor sax virtuosity.

It's clearly a chance for Hancock to return once again to his creative roots, when he was in Davis's great quintet of the mid-'60s, and he has excellent companions for the journey in Michael Brecker and Roy Hargrove, the tenor saxophonist and trumpeter who clearly demonstrate their inspiration in Coltrane and Miles. The CD begins with a reprise of Hancock's ~Sorcerer~ from his Miles period, with bassist John Patitucci and drummer Brian Blade, who were so crucial a part of Wayne Shorter's <em>Footprints Live</em>, and prove themselves just as important here. Blade is especially driving, pressing Hancock and the horns to complex creative dialogue. The synthesis of ~So What/Impressions,~ already closely linked tunes, benefits from the input of some fresh creative thinking, while Brecker's long cadenza on ~Naima~ is an effective invocation of Coltrane's intrepid virtuosity. Over 78 minutes in length, this is energetic, sometimes brilliant music, in many ways resembling Hancock's own classic, <em>Maiden Voyage</em>.</p> <p>&mdash;<strong>Stuart Broomer -- Amazon</strong></p>"

				"review": "<P>Given the heartbreaking context in which this album was released — this was the final recording by saxophonist Michael Brecker, who died of myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia only a few months before its release — there might be a certain temptation to cut it some slack for sentimental reasons. However, leniency is hardly needed. Leading a group comprised of jaw-dropping talents (pianists Herbie Hancock and Brad Mehldau, guitarist Pat Metheny, bassist John Patitucci, drummer Jack DeJohnette) and playing for the first time a program consisting entirely of original compositions, Brecker delivers an emotionally rich and startlingly powerful album of straight-ahead modern jazz that will stand as his musical epitaph and will effectively confound anyone who has ever been tempted to dismiss him as a mere jazz-pop fusioneer. It will also frustrate anyone looking for maudlin emotion or even any obvious product of existential angst; the only concession to sentiment here is on the title of a ballad, ~When Can I Kiss You Again?,~ a quote from Brecker's teenage son during a period in his treatment when his family was not allowed to touch him. But even that track, with its unusual chord progression and sometimes rather arid solos, retains a core of tough-mindedness within the tenderness. Most of the rest of the program consists of uptempo and medium-tempo burners that swing with a powerful sense of urgency and life, and precious little foreshadowing of the tragedy that all involved knew was soon to come. This is a brilliant and inspiring album — and would be whether or not it had anything to do with the death of one of the great figures in American jazz.</P><P>— <B>Rick Anderson</B></P><HR><P>Tenor saxophonist Michael Brecker lost his ongoing bout with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a rare bone marrow cancer, in January 2007. Pilgrimage provides one last chance to hear him in the company of like-minded souls. Joined by a who's who of mainstream jazz royalty, guitarist Pat Metheny, pianists Herbie Hancock and Brad Mehldau, bassist John Patitucci and drummer Jack DeJohnette accompany the saxophonist on this superlative session.</P><P>Brecker began his career as a session player in the early 1970s, something he continued to do throughout his career, to the chagrin of jazz purists. Having accompanied everyone from James Taylor and Joni Mitchell to McCoy Tyner and Charlie Haden, his ability to keep a foot in each camp made him an in-demand sideman. Combining John Coltrane's sheets of sound approach with funky soul, he established himself as one of the most distinctive voices of his generation.</P><P>His first album of all original tunes, Pilgrimage is also his most personal. Haunting ballads like “When Can I Kiss You Again?” and the churning “Five Months from Midnight” resonate with simmering emotion, but never subsume the session in mordant retroflection.</P><P>His illness does not appear to have hindered his playing abilities on this date at all. Sounding inspired and confident, his tone is strong and buoyant, his phrasing uplifting and intense, his fighting spirit apparent.</P><P>That spirit generates considerable heat, with the majority of the album propulsive and invigorating. Brisk post-bop (”The Mean Time”) and angular modernism (”Anagram”) alternate with simmering funk (”Tumbleweed”) and proto-fusion (”Pilgrimage”), often meeting halfway (”Cardinal Rule”). Delivering these tunes with elastic group interplay, the intuitive camaraderie shared between these artists is electrifying; rarely do musicians, even of this caliber, play to such heights.</P><P>DeJohnette is a marvel, his ceaselessly inventive patterns and thunderous palpitations are astonishing in their enthusiasm. His unbridled passion lifts the bandstand; this is one of his finest moments on record. Patiticci's bass resounds forcefully as Metheny unfurls billowy post-bop phrases with serpentine proficiency, even unleashing some processed distortion with his guitar synth. Splitting duties at the piano, Hancock and Mehldau provide a fascinating study in contrasts.</P><P>Michael Brecker's passing at age 57 is unfortunate. While some of his work over the years flirted with middling cross-over appeal, this uncompromising final statement is unquestionably from the heart. Pilgrimage is a stirring and celebratory jazz record, perhaps the finest of his career.</P><P>Track listing: The Mean Time; Five Months from Midnight; Anagram; Tumbleweed; When Can I Kiss You Again?; Cardinal Rule; Half Moon Lane; Loose Threads; Pilgrimage.</P><P>Personnel: Michael Brecker: tenor saxophone, EWI; Pat Metheny: guitars; Herbie Hancock: piano (1, 5, 6, 9); Brad Mehldau: piano (2, 3, 4, 6, 7); John Patitucci: bass; Jack DeJohnette: drums.</P><P>— <B>Troy Collins</B></P><HR><P>The importance of saxophonist Michael Brecker’s final recording, Pilgrimage, is densely multidimensional. The romantically inclined will attach significance to the fact that the nine compositions were conceived and recorded while Brecker was aware of the gravity of his final illness. Pilgrimage falls into an artistic/musical category that includes such disparate music as Mozart’s Requiem, Puccini’s Turandot, Billie Holiday’s Lady In Satin and Johnny Cash’s American Recordings, Volumes 5 &amp; 6. All of these examples were conceived during the artists' autumnal periods and, in these cases, represent something of pinnacles in their outputs.</P><P>High art in the face of destiny is not always the case, however. June Carter Cash’s final Wildwood Flower, while heartfelt, did the singer disfavor because she was obviously ill during the recording. Anita O’Day’s final recording, Indestructible, similarly sincere, was recorded much too far past the singer’s prime, and the aesthetic value of trumpeter Chet Baker’s final recordings remains up for debate. So, what of Michael Brecker’s final output?</P><P>In 2005, Brecker was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome, a diverse collection of hematologic disease all sharing in common the inappropriate production of blood cells and their propensities for transforming into acute myelogenous leukemia. Unable to find a suitable stem-cell donor, Brecker passed away on Saturday, January 13, 2007. While Brecker did remain active during the period of his illness, appearing on Beatle Jazz’s With A Little Help From Our Friends and Leni Stern’s Alu Maye (Have You Heard), he had been inactive a year before these recordings.</P><P>Thus, the artist’s largest late effort was reserved for Pilgrimage. He is joined by pianists Herbie Hancock and Brad Mehldau, guitarist Pat Metheny, bassist John Patitucci and drummer Jack DeJohnette, all sacred to Brecker’s generation of jazz musicians. The notable absence of Randy Brecker is acknowledged for the life-long collaboration he had with his brother in their various music endeavors. Save that, Brecker chose his group wisely as the results of the recording reveal.</P><P>Brecker’s tenor tone is strong and muscular. His composing is the best of his career. His melodic head-lines are organic, approximating a flock of small birds flying scattered one second and then in unison the next. Brecker and Metheny share a Bill Evans-Scott LaFaro empathy throughout the recording, both buoyed by the impressionistic piano of Hancock and Mehldau. The heart of the disc exists in its center with the pieces “Tumbleweed” and “When Can I Kiss You Again.” On the former, Brecker sets up a fast rolling theme and harmonics over which the soloists take quick flight including an aggressively distorted Metheny solo that gives way to one by Brecker. The rhythm section of Patitucci and DeJohnette creates a funky tonk with powerful momentum. No matter what, Brecker is in complete command.</P><P>“When Can I Kiss You Again” is Brecker’s introspective lullaby to his children, whom he could not see while in medical isolation. Again, his superior composing provides a carefully complex melodic introduction with a modal concept over which to solo. Composition and improvisation weave in and out of one another; constructing a silken fabric over which Metheny gives one his most inspired and introverted solos. Hancock provides his trademark abstraction as solo, depicting anxiousness as music. Brecker’s solo is middle to low register and impeccably structured (as are all of his solos). The disc’s title cut is a moody, Coltrane-esque meditation over electric piano with bass and drums occupying all sonic spaces. The piece grows in density and freedom as an open improvisation develops over the barest harmonic structure. And that was just the extended introduction. Brecker pulls all involved into an extended obbligato that is serpentine and seamless.</P><P>How does history view Michael Brecker? Many consider him to be the most important tenor saxophone player since John Coltrane. This is at the expense of Wayne Shorter, though Shorter generationally overlaps Coltrane. I would come closer to declaring John Coltrane, Wayne Shorter and Michael Brecker the apex of the tenor saxophone since Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster. That excludes a lot and that exclusion is necessary. Brecker’s importance lies in his universality. When I listen to Oliver Nelson’s The Blues And The Abstract Truth (Impulse, 1961), I think of that music as a jazz soundtrack of the 1960s. It had that sound that listeners would immediately identify as jazz: so with Pilgrimage and the opening of the 21st Century. Michael Brecker’s final recording is a finely crafted jazz soundtrack for a new millennium, serving in honor of the late saxophonist and all of jazz.</P><P>— <B>C. Michael Bailey.</B></P><HR><P>Michael Brecker’s tragic death in January 2007, at the age of fifty-seven, robbed the world of perhaps the most influential saxophonist to emerge since the equally untimely passing of John Coltrane. It’s easy to forget that he was one of the pop/rock world’s most called-upon studio players, recording on hundreds of albums with artists including James Taylor, Paul Simon and Eric Clapton. But it’s his prodigious body of work in the jazz realm that will be his most enduring legacy.</P><P>It’s easy to want Pilgrimage to be one of Brecker’s best recordings out of a purely emotional response to his passing. While the knowledge that this is his final recording creates an unassailable sense of loss, the fact remains that the writing on Pilgrimage stands as some of his best, and if he was in a weakened state you’d never know it. Brecker sounds as strong as he ever did—stronger, in fact.</P><P>For this last session Brecker called upon old friends—guitarist Pat Metheny, bassist John Patitucci, drummer Jack DeJohnette and pianist Herbie Hancock (who plays on four tracks). He also collaborates, for the first time, with pianist Brad Mehldau on five tracks. That Hancock and Mehldau are vastly different players is an understatement; yet Pilgrimage remains cohesive and focused, with both players bringing their own inimitable strengths to the material.</P><P>Brecker’s unmistakable writing style stems, at times, from a post-Coltrane modality, but there’s a greater complexity and distinctive language. Solo space abounds, but Brecker’s ambitious writing is longer-form, with all manner of twists and turns that bring out some of the best performances on record from everyone involved. When DeJohnette takes one of his most energetic solos on the rhythmically and harmonically shifting “Anagram,” it’s over a metrically challenging piano/bass ostinato that ultimately turns contrapuntal when Metheny and Brecker reenter.</P><P>“Tumbleweed,” with Metheny’s signature synth tone, bears comparison to the guitarist’s own “Song for Bilbao” in that it’s an altered blues (also featuring a surprisingly funky solo from Mehldau), while the slinky groove of “Loose Threads” finds Hancock straddling the line between greater abstraction and more grounded soulfulness. Metheny seems to be inspired towards greater risks, with some of his most evocative playing in recent years.</P><P>Brecker takes the first solo on the opening salvo of “The Mean Time,” quickly dispensing with any notion that illness had compromised the visceral power that was a defining characteristic of his playing. “When Can I Kiss You Again?” may be a slow tempo tune with softer edges, but Brecker manages to mine surprising depths of emotion here as well.</P><P>They say that music has healing power. It may not have been able to prevent the inevitable with Brecker’s illness; but for brief time, a scant five months before his death, it’s clear that music gave him the strength to record a watershed album that represents a remarkable end to an equally extraordinary musical life.</P><P>— <B>John Kelman</B></P>"

		"biography": "<p>Born: June 26, 1893, Scott, MS<br>Died: August 15, 1958, Chicago, IL</p><p>In terms of his musical skill, the sheer size of his repertoire, the length and variety of his career and his influence on contemporaries and musicians who would follow, Big Bill Broonzy is among a select few of the most important figures in recorded blues history. Among his hundreds of titles are standards like ~All by Myself~ and ~Key to the Highway.~ In this country he was instrumental in the growth of the Chicago Blues sound, and his travels abroad rank him as one of the leading blues ambassadors.</p><p>Literally born on the banks of the Mississippi, he was one of a family of 17 who learned to fiddle on a homemade instrument. Taught by his uncle, he was performing by age ten at social functions and in church. After brief stints on the pulpit and in the Army, he moved to Chicago where he switched his attention from violin to guitar, playing with elders like Papa Charlie Jackson. Broonzy began his recording career with Paramount in 1927. In the early '30s he waxed some brilliant blues and hokum and worked Chicago and the road with great players like pianist Black Bob, guitarist Will Weldon and Memphis Minnie.</p><p>During the Depression years Big Bill Broonzy continued full steam ahead, doing some   acrobatic label-hopping (Paramount to Bluebird to Columbia to Okeh!). In addition   to solo efforts, he contributed his muscular guitar licks to recordings by Bumble   Bee Slim, John Lee (Sonny Boy) Williamson and others who were forging a powerful   new Chicago sound.</p><p>In 1938, Broonzy was at Carnegie Hall (ostensibly filling in for the fallen Robert Johnson)   for John Hammond's revolutionary Sprirtuals to Swing Series. The following year   he appeared with Benny Goodman and Louis Armstrong in George Seldes's film production   Swingin' the Dream. After his initial brush with the East Coast cognoscenti,   however, Broonzy spent a good part of the early '40s barnstorming the South   with Lil Green's road show or kicking back in Chicago with Memphis Slim.</p><p>He continued alternating stints in Chicago and New York with coast-to-coast road work until   1951 when live performances and recording dates overseas earned him considerable   notoriety in Europe and led to worldwide touring. Back in the States he recorded   for Chess, Columbia and Folkways, working with a spectrum of artists from Blind   John Davis to Pete Seeger. In 1955, Big Bill Blues, his life as told to Danish   writer Yannick Bruynoghe, was published.</p><p>In 1957, after one more British tour, the pace began to catch up with Broonzy. He spent   the last year of his life in and out of hospitals and succumbed to cancer in   1958. He survives though; not only in his music, but in the remembrances of   people who knew him...from Muddy Waters to Studs Terkel. A gentle giant they   say...tough enough to survive the blues world...but not so tough he wouldn't   give a struggling young musician the shirt off his back. His music, of course,   is absolutely basic to the blues experience.</p><p><b>Steve James, All-Music Guide </b></p>",

		"firstname": "Jackson",
		"lastname": "Browne",
		"name": "Jackson Browne",
		"biography": "<p>In many ways, Jackson Browne was the quintessential sensitive Californian singer/songwriter of the early '70s. Only Joni Mitchell and James Taylor ranked alongside him in terms of influence, but neither artist tapped into the post-'60s zeitgeist like Browne. While the majority of his classic '70s work was unflinchingly personal, it nevertheless provided a touchstone for a generation of maturing baby boomers coming to terms with adulthood. Not only did his introspective, literate lyrics strike a nerve, but his laid-back folk-rock set the template for much of the music to come out of California during the '70s. With his first four albums, Browne built a loyal following that helped him break into the mainstream with 1976's The Pretender. During the late '70s and early '80s, he was at the height of his popularity, as each of his albums charted in the Top Ten. Midway through the '80s, Browne made a series of political protest records that caused his audience to gradually shrink, but when he returned to introspective songwriting with 1993's <i>I'm Alive</i>, he made a modest comeback.</p><p>Born in Heidelberg, West Germany, Jackson Browne and his family moved to Los Angeles when he was three years old, and by the time he was a teenager, Browne had developed an interest in folk music. He began playing guitar and writing songs, which he sang at local folk clubs. Early in 1966, he was invited to join the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, whom he had met through the L.A. folk circuit. While he was only with the band for a few months, the group recorded a handful of his songs on its first two records. By the beginning of 1967, he had signed a publishing deal with Nina Music, a division of Elektra Records; Nina helped Browne secure songs on albums by Tom Rush and Steve Noonan in 1968. During 1967 and 1968, he lived in New York's Greenwich Village, where he played in Tim Buckley's backing band. Browne also began working with Nico, who recorded three of his songs on her <i>Chelsea Girl</i> album. When their relationship disintegrated in 1968, he returned to Los Angeles, where he unsuccessfully tried to record a solo album and form a folk group with Ned Doheney and Jack Wilce. Browne continued to play local clubs and his reputation as a songwriter continued to grow, with Linda Ronstadt and the Byrds recording his songs. By the end of 1971, he had signed with David Geffen's fledgling Asylum Records on the strength of his widely circulated demo tape.</p><p><i>Jackson Browne</i> was released in the spring of 1972, spawning the Top Ten hit single ~Doctor My Eyes.~ Shortly after ~Doctor My Eyes~ reached its peak position, ~Take It Easy,~ a song Browne co-wrote with Glenn Frey, became the Eagles' breakthrough hit. Many songs from his debut, including ~Rock Me on the Water~ and ~Jamaica Say You Will,~ became singer/songwriter standards, but the album itself didn't establish Browne as a pop star, despite its hit single. On his second album, 1973's <i>For Everyman</i>, he began a long-term collaboration with instrumentalist David Lindley. <i>For Everyman</i> was a commercial disappointment, yet it consolidated his cult following.</p><p>Released in the fall of 1974, <i>Late for the Sky</i> expanded Browne's audience significantly, peaking at number 14 on the charts and going gold by the beginning of the following year. Browne's first wife, Phyllis, committed suicide in the spring of 1976, but in the wake of the tragedy he recorded his commercial breakthrough album, <i>The Pretender</i>. The record climbed into the Top Ten upon its fall 1976 release, going platinum in the spring of 1977. In the summer, Browne launched an extensive tour, recording a new album while he was on the road. The resulting record, <i>Running On Empty</i> (1977), was a bigger success than its predecessor, peaking at number three and launching the hit singles ~Running On Empty~ and ~Stay/The Load-Out.~ With his career riding high, Browne began to pursue political and social causes, most notably protesting the use of nuclear energy.</p><p>The success of <i>Hold Out</i>, the 1980 follow-up to <i>Running On Empty</i>, was evidence of Jackson Browne's popularity. Though the album wasn't as well crafted as its predecessors, it became his only number one album upon its summer release. In the summer of 1982, ~Somebody's Baby,~ from the soundtrack of <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>, became Browne's biggest hit, climbing to number seven on the U.S. charts. Divided between love songs and political protests, <i>Lawyers in Love</i> was another hit due to success of the hit singles ~Lawyers in Love,~ ~Tender Is the Night,~ and ~For a Rocker.~ Nevertheless, the album also showcased a newly found social consciousness, which dominated 1986's <i>Lives in the Balance</i>. The album lacked any hit singles, yet its fiery condemnation of the Reagan era won an audience -- the album stayed on the charts for over six months and went gold.</p><p>Jackson Browne continued to write primarily political songs on 1989's <i>World in Motion</i>, but the record became his first album to not go gold. Browne was quiet for the next four years, working on a variety of social causes and suffering a painful public breakup with his girlfriend, actress Daryl Hannah. He finally returned with a comeback effort in the fall of 1993 entitled <i>I'm Alive</i>. Comprised of personal songs, <i>I'm Alive</i> received his best reviews since the late '70s and the record went gold without producing any major hits. In the spring of 1996, Browne released <i>Looking East</i>, which failed to gain the same attention as <i>I'm Alive</i>. In 2002, he released <i>The Naked Ride Home</i>. Two years later the two disc <i>The Very Best of Jackson Browne</i> hit the shelves as Browne was being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by fellow Hall of Famer Bruce Springsteen. Around this time Browne took to the road and played intimate, acoustic shows around the globe. The 2005 release <i>Solo Acoustic, Vol. 1</i> was compiled from these concerts and appeared on Inside Recordings, an independent label founded by Browne.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>",

				"review": "<p>One of the reasons that Jackson Browne's first album is among the most auspicious debuts in pop music history is that it doesn't sound like a debut. Although only 23, Browne had kicked around the music business for several years, writing and performing as a member of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and as Nico's backup guitarist, among other gigs, while many artists recorded his material. So, if this doesn't sound like someone's first batch of songs, it's not. Browne had developed an unusual use of language, studiedly casual yet full of striking imagery, and a post-apocalyptic viewpoint to go with it. He sang with a calm certainty over spare, discretely placed backup -- piano, acoustic guitar, bass, drums, congas, violin, harmony vocals -- that highlighted the songs and always seemed about to disappear. In song after song, Browne described the world as a desert in need of moisture, and this wet/dry dichotomy carried over into much of the imagery. In ~Doctor My Eyes,~ the album's most propulsive song and a Top Ten hit, he sang, ~Doctor, my eyes/Cannot see the sky/Is this the prize/For having learned how not to cry?~ If Browne's outlook was cautious, its expression was original. His conditional optimism seemed to reflect hard experience, and in the early '70s, the aftermath of the '60s, a lot of his listeners shared that perspective. Like any great artist, Browne articulated the tenor of his times. But the album has long since come to seem a timeless collection of reflective ballads touching on still-difficult subjects -- suicide (explicitly), depression and drug use (probably), spiritual uncertainty and desperate hope -- all in calm, reasoned tones, and all with an amazingly eloquent sense of language. Jackson Browne's greater triumph is that, having perfectly expressed its times, it transcended those times as well. (The album features a cover depicting Browne's face on a water bag -- an appropriate reference to its desert/water imagery -- containing the words ~saturate before using.~ Inevitably, many people began to refer to the self-titled album by that phrase, and when it was released on CD, it nearly became official -- both the disc and the spine of the jewel box read Saturate Before Using.)</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Having cherry-picked years of songwriting the first time around, he turned to some of his secondary older material, which was still better than most people's best and, ironically, more accessible -- notably such songs as ~These Days,~ which had been covered six times already, dating back to Nico's Chelsea Girl album in 1967, and ~Take It Easy,~ a co-composition with the Eagles' Glenn Frey that had been a Top 40 hit for the group in 1972. Browne unsuccessfully looked for another hit single with the up-tempo ~Red Neck Friend,~ reminisced about meeting his wife and starting a family in the coy ~Ready or Not,~ and, at the end, finally came up with a new song to rank with those on the first album in the philosophical title track, which reportedly was his more positive reply to Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's ~Wooden Ships.~ (David Crosby sang harmony.) Musically, the album was still restrained, but not as austere as Jackson Browne, as the singer had hooked up with multi-instrumentalist David Lindley, who would introduce interesting textures to his music on a variety of stringed instruments for the next several years. All of which is to say that For Everyman was a less consistent collection than Browne's debut album. But Browne's songwriting ability remained impressive.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Employing a real producer, Jon Landau, for the first time, Browne made what sounded like a real contemporary rock record, but this made his songs less effective; the ersatz Mexican arrangement of ~Linda Paloma~ and the bouncy second half of ~Daddy's Tune,~ with its horn charts and guitar solo, undercut the lyrics. The man who had delved so deeply into life's abyss on his earlier albums was in search of escape this time around, whether by crying (~Here Come Those Tears Again~), sleeping (~Sleep's Dark and Silent Gate~), or making peace with estranged love ones (~The Only Child,~ ~Daddy's Tune~). None of it worked, however, and when Browne came to the final track -- traditionally the place on his albums where he summed up his current philosophical stance -- he delivered ~The Pretender,~ a cynical, sarcastic treatise on moneygrubbing and the shallow life of the suburbs. Primarily inner-directed, the song's defeatist tone demands rejection, but it is also a quintessential statement of its time, the post-Watergate '70s; dire as that might be, you had to admire that kind of honesty, even as it made you wince.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Just as, in Hold Out, one wasn't so much inspired as informed that Browne had found love, on I'm Alive, one wasn't so much moved as told that he'd lost it. While it was good news that he wasn't tilting at windmills anymore, Browne did not make a full comeback with the album, despite a couple of well-constructed songs.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

On his first outing in six years, Browne again waxes autobiographical, wandering through his extensive interior landscape and transforming his pain into art. But after three decades, his songs of elusive love lost and found have become a little bit wry and world-weary. Witness the bittersweet title song, where the details are so crisp and well drawn that it's difficult to believe that he didn't just lift them from his own life. Similarly, ~The Night Inside Me~ returns to some of the wrenching themes of 1975's <i>Late for the Sky</i> with fresh anger. But it is Jackson Browne's turbulent romantic history--his elevation of the small, significant details that make up a life, or more poignantly, show one unraveling--that defines his work, and which is in full flower here.</p> <p><b>--Jaan Uhelszki</b></p>"

Guess he wants you to know he still matters to people -- and it's totally unnecessary. The music here speaks for itself. Whether or not one appreciates Browne's recorded catalog is immaterial; his gift as a songwriter is enigmatic, unassailable, and singular. There are 12 songs here from throughout Browne's career, ranging from ~These Days~ and ~For Everyman~ to ~Lives in the Balance~ and ~Looking East~ and all points in between. There are numerous spoken and instrumental intros to the material; Browne's a fine and comfortable communicator when it comes to sitting naked and alone in front of an audience, though sometimes his humor is cynical and borders on bitter. The versions of ~For a Dancer~ and ~The Pretender~ are deeply moving as are ~These Days~ and ~Too Many Angels.~ It would be easy to live without all the intros, as they merely point toward Browne and what he has accomplished, when the songs so easily speak for themselves and for him. Perhaps on volume two he'll let that happen. Despite his many asides, this is a fine and necessary addition to Browne's catalog. Still one has to wonder, with the double-disc Rhino set that appeared earlier in 2005 and these live retrospectives, when there will be new material coming from a songwriter who has had something to say that mattered in each of the last four decades. Let's hope it's soon.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

				"review": "<p>Love Is Strange: En Vivo con Tino is, simply put, a double CD that documents Jackson Browne's and David Lindley’s short Spanish tour of 2006. But it’s actually far more than that. While the song titles may be familiar to fans of both men, they don’t begin to tell the musical story on display here. Lindley and Browne were accompanied on all dates by the great flamenco percussionist, rock drummer, and producer Tino di Geraldo, and on select concerts by well-known Spanish musicians flutist Carlos Nunéz, vocalists Kiko Veneno and Luz Casal, banduria player Javier Mas, and others. Beautifully recorded, this set shows what Browne is capable of when he has musical foils who will not allow him to simply rest on his laurels. Lindley is, as expected, brilliant in shaping the textures and surfaces of these songs as well as highlighting the more subtle melodic touches in them, and Di Geraldo's rhythmic interactions push these two to play at their level best. The interplay between him and Lindley is near symbiotic, even on the most basic of tunes like “Mercury Blues” or ~For Taking the Trouble,” where the percussionist plays tablas to Lindley’s bouzouki. The Latinization of “El Rayo X,” with Browne on a baritone guitar and stellar harmony vocals by Lindley is a high point. Lindley plays fiddle on “Take It Easy,” and transforms it into something that envisions a Spanish bluegrass. “These Days,” with Casal’s heavily accented guest vocal, the fiddle, and di Geraldo's cajón, makes an already beautiful song exquisite. Lindley’s Hawaiian guitar transforms “Running on Empty” from its former place as a rock anthem to '70s-era alienation into a haunted warning filled with regret and loss. A full-band performance of the nine-minute closer “The Next You Voice You Hear,” featuring Veneno on duet vocals, also includes the cajón, tres player Raul Rodriguez, Hawaiian guitar, Charlie Cepeda on baritone guitar, and Nunéz's whistle. It becomes a dry, arid, funky blues that sends the whole package off on a soaring though lonesome note. This could have been an experiment that failed miserably, drenched in nostalgia and excess; instead, it succeeds grandly because of a sparse, tasteful approach with excellent arrangements and genuinely inspired performances.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Jackson Browne gave listeners the first volume of his solo acoustic live performances in 2005. It was steeped in the gems from his rich catalog, presented with spoken word introductions to many of his best-known songs with a smattering of newer ones. The commentary got tiring in the CD format, but the music was impeccable and illustrated just how valuable he's been to American music as a songwriter. This second volume, while it does the same thing, is — in a manner — a mirror image of the first. The songs here are primarily from his later years. What's really interesting is that it doesn't matter. Browne's later songs communicate so directly that, presented in this manner, with only an acoustic guitar or a piano as accompaniment, we can find ourselves wandering around in reverie, or re-glimpsing the traces of emotion and time's passage as signposts to the way we live now. While there are a few ~classic~ tracks — ~Redneck Friend,~ ~Something Fine,~ and ~Somebody's Baby~ (from the Fast Times at Ridgemont High soundtrack) — most of the material here comes from records after Hold Out. There are three tunes from his last studio offering, the generally ignored and underrated Naked Ride Home, which stack up seamlessly with his '70s material. Those tunes, ~The Night Inside Me,~ ~Casino Nation,~ and ~My Stunning Mystery Companion,~ grace the beginning, middle, and end of this offering. In other words, no matter where else Browne goes (and he goes all the way back to ~Something Fine~), he returns to the present tense, where he now exists as a songwriter. The performances of these tracks, and those from albums such as Looking East, I'm Alive, World in Motion, and Lives in the Balance, offer listeners an opportunity to hear Browne at his most elemental. His songs began this way, with a lone instrumental backing, as a melody dictating itself to words or vice versa, and were hammered out or came in the flush of white-heat creativity, but they were shorn of any adornment — just as they are here. The spoken introductions to several numbers are overly long and may have been fine for a sitting audience, but don't necessarily translate well to CD. That's a small complaint, however, as these 12 songs are quietly powerful, full of a particular craft and enigmatic gifts — no matter when they were written or recorded. Browne has never lost it as a songwriter; this is the proof. If you went to the trouble to purchase the first volume, this is an essential counterpart.</p><strong>&mdash; Thom Jurek</strong>"

				"review": "<p>Time the Conqueror is Jackson Browne's first studio offering in six years. The last was 2002's Naked Ride Home for Elektra. Browne established his sound in the '70s and has made precious few adjustments, with the exception of a couple of records in the '80s where the keyboards and drum machines of the period were woven into his heady, West Coast pop, singer/songwriter mix. Whereas his '90s albums I'm Alive and Looking East, as well as Naked Ride Home, mirrored the personal concerns of his '70s records in more elegiac terms, Time the Conqueror returns in some ways to Browne's more overtly political statements from the '80s such as Lives in the Balance and World in Motion and weighs them against the personal, but he's all but forgotten how to write hooks. The title track is as personal as it gets; its breezy, cut-time beat and airy melody signals motion like the white lines clicking by on a highway. They underscore both time and life passing away, juxtaposed against the need to appreciate each moment. Browne accepts the blindness of the future as he does the helplessness of the past, though he doesn't accept aging. The next couple of tracks underscore this. There's the elegy to the '60s in ~Off to Wonderland,~ a paean to the lost innocence of the heady years of idealism betrayed in both the Kennedys' and Martin Luther King's murders. The last line in this midtempo rock ballad is: ~Didn't we believe that love would carry on/Wouldn't we receive enough/If we could just believe in one another/As much as we believed in John.~ It was wonderland, all right; these ideals were not hollow but they had no basis in American reality. The hardest rocking cut is ~The Drums of War,~ which is Browne at his most didactic. It's as much a renewed call to arms as it is an indictment of the Bush years. It's a quickly passing moment, however, in that the very next track, ~The Arms of Night,~ is a spiritual paean urging the listener to seek love in the right places. It's tender, confused, and authentic, but dull. ~Where Were You?~ has more teeth with its stuttering attempt at 21st century funk. Musically it serves more as a rock track with actual rhythm than it does funk. It's another socio-political indictment of alleged apathy in the post-millennial age. This album goes on, with no real aim other than telling us things that Browne's been thinking about these days (with the exception of the Latin-tinged ~Goin' Down to Cuba,~ the best tune here; it's the only song with something resembling a hook). Browne seems to be speaking to his own generation; he's still trying to make sense of the world he wanted to live in and the one he actually does. Next time out, though, instead of worrying about his ~enlightened~ perspective, perhaps he should pay more attention to what made his earlier songs feel as if he actually owned one: craft. Most of these songs feel like quickly dashed off poems; it's all ~tell~ with no ~show,~ because there isn't anything in the music to effectively offer them to the listener as conversation; instead they are on display as mixed-message sermons.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>On Jackson Browne's first studio recording since 2008, the man who defined the '70s singer/songwriter generation finds a fresh way of dealing with the world as it is both personally and politically -- by going back to his own roots. Lyrically, Browne is inspired in a way he hasn't been since 1976's The Pretender, and this recording's production aesthetic adheres closer to that of even earlier records. His core accompanists are guitarists Greg Leisz and Val McCallum, with an all-star cast. Socio-political songs are plentiful, but these come from an intimate -- and therefore more appealing -- perspective; he often uses personal memory to frame his concerns. The opener is a (finally) finished version of ~The Birds of St. Marks,~ a song begun in 1967 and performed live intermittently but never recorded in a studio. Its sound harkens back to the the Byrds. Jangly guitars and an electric 12-string solo frame its introspective lyrics. ~Yeah Yeah~ borrows the changes from Lou Reed's ~Sweet Jane~ and pulls them off anew in a love song: ~And you paid for the love that we've got, you paid/And you made for the heart when we fought and you stayed…~ ~Leaving Winslow~ is a West Coast country song whose locale was namechecked in ~Take It Easy,~ yet this isn't an exercise in nostalgia but a solid, and sometimes humorous, paean to acceptance and the desire to disappear.</p> <p>Few writers could deliver a poignant song where surfing transitions to environmentalism and the historical consequences of empire. Browne can, and does -- with obvious melodic inspiration from Paul McCartney -- on ~If I Could Be Anywhere,~ where step by step, the political is equated with personal responsibility. There are two exceptional covers that introduce the record's latter half. Both are stellar love songs that are nonetheless topical, and both are by true song poets. The first is a stunning folk-rock arrangement of Woody Guthrie's ~You Know the Night,~ while ~Walls and Doors~ is a translation of Cuban songwriter/guitarist Carlos Varela's ~Las Paredes y Puertas,~ and features him and his trio. The latter is a lilting romantic ballad, arranged to underscore both the composer's and Browne's personas. Only ~Which Side Are You On~ sounds ~preachy,~ but that's because it is; it employs the same gospel-blues lyric scheme Bob Dylan did on ~You Gotta Serve Somebody~ but to secular ends. The title track, led by the songwriter and his piano, is a testament to the power of irrepressible hope and resilience: ~Though the world may tremble and our foundations crack/We will all assemble and we will build them back.~ Closer ~Here~ is one of Browne's classic broken love songs; its sadness echoes long after the album whispers to a close. Standing in the Breach is a back to the basics Browne album, and is all the better for it. He's no longer speaking at anyone, but conversing from the well of his own experience.</p><p>&mdash;<string>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><p>~It's never been that hard to buy a gun/Now they'll sell a Glock 19 to just about anyone,~ muses Jackson Browne midway through ~The Long Way Around,~ balancing America's pursuit of freedom with the notion of consequence. Even in what the singer/songwriter can't embrace, he seeks compassion as piano chords fall like soft rain, ultimately offering, ~With all we disagree about/The passions burn, the heart goes out…~</p><p>Browne has always led a double life: sensitive singer/songwriter and committed activist. During his 40-year career, there's been a tug of war between the romantic poet and the surging outcry. On Standing In The Breach, his first album since 2008's Time The Conqueror, the Southern California soft rock icon seamlessly reconciles the two.</p><p>Drawing on touchstones from his past, most notably The Pretender, Late for the Sky and For Everyman, he embraces his past without getting mired in the temple of who he used to be. His past is vibrant, but the shimmering melodies and tracks' spaciousness lends Breach immediacy.</p><p>Browne also reinvents Lou Reed—taking the changes of ~Sweet Jane~ and writing a forged-by-mingled-lives love song ~Yeah Yeah~—and Bob Dylan—recasting the churning ~Gotta Serve Somebody~ in a more personal reckoning/invitation ~Which Side?~—in far more hopeful terms. He even invokes ~Take It Easy,~ Browne's co-written ‘70s Eagles anthem, with the train-beat rootlessness of ~Leaving Winslow.~</p><p>He understands the chambers and echoes of the heart. The haunted ~Here~ embodies the numb vertigo of a lover's absence, while the mythic ~The Birds of St Marks,~ begun in 1967 and played sporadically live but never recorded, weighs the costs and loss in love from a young man's eye.</p><p>That idealism permeates the twang of ~You Know The Night,~ a song of desire realized through the prism of awareness—drawn from 15 pages of Woody Guthrie's journals. The same ardor infused with seeking a higher world entwines Carlos Varela's ~Windows + Doors,~ Varela providing plangent echo vocals as the song finds a hushed climax.</p><p>Unlike Pete Seeger, Browne's activism never drowned the lover inside. For Breach, the two merge with an intoxicating sense; the personal elevates the political. ~Breach~ delicately offers optimism beneath its reckoning, while ~If I Could Be Anywhere~ tackles hard truth, love and the notion this is where he chooses to make his stand.</p><p>But it's ~The Long Way Around,~ where his misspent youth and our cultural mandates merge in a wake-up call as he name-checks Citizens United and the Gulf oil spill. Here acceptance isn't acquiescence, but the suggestion coming together is the only chance we have. For Browne, Breach is the best of all worlds.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Holly Gleason</strong></p>"

		"biography": "<p><B>John Symon Asher Bruce</B><BR>BORN:  May 14, 1943, Lanarkshire, Scotland<BR><br> Although some may be tempted to call multi-instrumentalist, songwriter and composer Jack Bruce a rock & roll musician, blues and jazz are what this innovative musician really loves. As a result, these two genres are at the base of most of the recorded output from a career that goes back to the beginning of London's blues scene in 1962. In that year, he joined Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated.</p><p>Bruce's most famous songs are, in essence, blues tunes: ~Sunshine of Your Love,~ ~Strange Brew,~ ~Politician,~ and ~White Room.~ Bruce's best-known songs remain those he penned for Cream, the legendary blues rock trio he formed with drummer Ginger Baker and guitarist Eric Clapton in July, 1966. Baker and Bruce played together for five years before Clapton came along, and although their trio only lasted until November 1968, the group is credited with changing the face of rock & roll and bringing blues to a worldwide audience. Through their creative arrangements of classic blues tunes like Robert Johnson's ~Crossroads,~ Skip James's ~I'm So Glad,~ Willie Dixon's ~Spoonful,~ and Albert King's ~Born Under a Bad Sign,~ the group helped popularize blues-rock and led the way for similar groups that came about later on, like Led Zeppelin.</p><p>Bruce was born May 14, 1943, in Lanarkshire, near Glasgow, Scotland. His father was a big jazz fan, and so he credits people like Louis Armstrong and Fats Waller among his earliest influences. He grew up listening to jazz and took up bass and cello as a teen. After three months at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music, he left, disgusted with the politics of music school. After travelling around Europe for a while, he settled into the early blues scene in 1962 in London, where he eventually met drummer Ginger Baker. He played with British blues pioneers Alexis Korner and Graham Bond before leaving in 1965 to join John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, whose guitarist was Eric Clapton. This gave him time to get his chops together without having to practice. With Manfred Mann, who he also played with before forming Cream, Bruce learned about the business of making hit songs. The group's reputation for long, extended blues jams began at the Fillmore in San Francisco at a concert organized by impressario Bill Graham. Bruce later realized that Cream gave him a chance to succeed as a musician, and admitted that if it weren't for that group, he might never have escaped London. After Cream split up in November 1968, Bruce formed Jack Bruce and Friends with drummer Mitch Mitchell and guitarist Larry Coryell. Recording-wise, Bruce took a different tack away from blues and blues-rock, leaning more in a folk-rock direction with his solo albums Songs for a Tailor (1969), Harmony Row (1971) and Out of the Storm (1974).</p><p>In 1970 and 1971, he worked with Tony Williams Lifetime before putting together another power trio with guitarist Leslie West and drummer Corky Laing in 1972, simply called West, Bruce and Laing. After working with Frank Zappa on his album Apostrophe in 1974, Bruce was at it again in '75 with the Jack Bruce Band, where members included keyboardist Carla Bley and guitarist Mick Taylor. Again on the road in 1980 with Jack Bruce and Friends, the latter version of the group included drummer Billy Cobham, keyboardist David Sancious and guitarist Clem Clempson, formerly of Humble Pie. In the early '80s, he formed another trio, B.L.T., this time with guitarist Robin Trower before working with Kip Hanrahan on his three solo albums.</p><p>Through three and a half decades, Bruce has always been a supreme innovator, pushing himself into uncharted waters with his jazz and folk-rock compositions. Bruce's bluesiest albums would have to include all of his work with Cream, the albums B.L.T. and Truce with Robin Trower, some of his West, Bruce and Laing recordings, and several of his albums from the 1980s and early '90s.

Originally touted as a limited-edition double CD upon its release in 1993, the CMP label subsequently witnessed production/distribution problems, yet in 2001 it seemed as though the German fusion/rock record label might commence reissuing some CDs from its impressive back catalog. These two discs intimate an intriguing insight into Bruce's career, other than his well-known affiliation with '60s rock power trio Cream. Here, the artist renders a few soulful ballads, ventures into free jazz territory with saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith and ex-Cream drummer Ginger Baker, and also utilizes a brass section for a sprightly R&B rendition of ~Born Under a Bad Sign.~ An added treat here is the teaming of British guitar hero Gary Moore with Bruce and Baker for a series of hard rock-blues pieces culled from the Cream songbook.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Glenn Astarita</b></p><h4>Tracks</h4><h3>1. Can You Follow </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce; vocals, piano</p><p>The concert starts with just Jack on his piano, and singing of course.</p><hr/><h3>2. Running Thro' Our Hands </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, piano</p><p>Gary Husband: keyboards</p><p>Still a beautiful song.</p><hr/><h3>3. Over The Cliff </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: bass</p><p>Dick Heckstall-Smith: saxophone</p><p>Ginger Baker: drums</p><p>These guys immediately got the atmosphere of that good jazz from ~Things we like~. Really great bass playing by Jack, with that rhytmic power of Ginger Baker backing him up. The quality of Dick Heckstall-Smith needs no further explanation.</p><hr/><h3>4. Statues </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: bass</p><p>Dick Heckstall-Smith: saxophone </p><p>Ginger Baker: drums</p><p>Dick Heckstall-Smith shows that he is still a great saxophone player.</p><hr/><h3>5. First Time I Met The Blues </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: bass, vocals</p><p>Clem Clempson: guitar</p><p>Dick-Heckstall-Smith: saxophone </p><p>Ginger Baker: drums</p><p>Yes, here's the blues. You can sense that these four musicians really enjoy playing together. Some great guitar solos by Clem Clempson. But don't forget they're used to playing together (Clem and Dick in Colosseum and Jack and Ginger in the Cream, and of course Clem and Dick have played together with Jack on several recordings).</p><hr/><h3>6. Smiles And Grins </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: bass, vocals, piano </p><p>Clem Clempson: guitar ;</p><p>Dick-Heckstall-Smith: saxophone </p><p>Art Themen: saxophone ;</p><p>Bernie Worrell: hammond organ </p><p>Malcolm Bruce: synthesizer ;</p><p>Gary Husband: drums</p><p>This version is even better than the original one on the Harmony Row album. Partly because it is such a perfect song to perform live, and partly because of the addition of the saxophones. Besides that, Clem Clempson plays a different style of guitar playing than Chris Spedding. And last but not least, it's Bernie Worrell on the hammond organ!</p><hr/><h3>7. Bird Alone </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: bass, vocals </p><p>Clem Clempson: guitar</p><p>Bernie Worrell: hammond organ, piano </p><p>Gary Husband: drums</p><p>Great up-tempo song, with these driving bass and guitar lines. Jack singing this one real fast. He can hardly keep up with himself. The second part of the song is much slower, but has still so much power.</p><hr/><h3>8. Neighbor, Neighbor </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: bass, vocals</p><p>Clem Clempson: guitar</p><p>Dick Heckstall-Smith: saxophone</p><p>Art Themen: saxophone</p><p>Henry Lowther: trumpet</p><p>John Mumford: trombone</p><p>Bernie Worrell: hammond organ </p><p>Simon Phillips: drums</p><p>As you can see on the line-up, this is a more jazzy song, with a blues feeling to it. I love that saxophone solo in the middle of the song. Lovely guitar solo by Clem Clempson.</p><hr/><h3>9. Born Under A Bad Sign </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: bass, vocals</p><p>Clem Clempson: guitar</p><p>Dick Heckstall-Smith: saxophone </p><p>Art Themen: saxophone</p><p>Henry Lowther: trumpet</p><p>John Mumford: trombone</p><p>Bernie Worrell: hammond organ </p><p>Jason Bruce: piano</p><p>Simon Phillips: drums</p><p>A classical one, that we all know from the Cream. These horns give this song that little extra that makes it different from other performances. Good guitar playing by Clem Clempson (I've always liked the Jack Bruce recordings on which he participates).</p><hr/><h3>10. Ships In The Night </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals</p><p>Maggie Reilly: vocals</p><p>Clem Clempson: acoustic and electric guitar</p><p>Malcolm Bruce: acoustic guitar</p><p>Bernie Worrell: hammond organ</p><p>Gary Husband; piano</p><p>François Garny: bass</p><p>Simon Phillips; drums</p><p>As I stated on the ~Willpower~ review, this is a great song. I do like the studio recording better. An exception i want to make for that beautiful guitar solo by Clem Clempson.</p><hr/><h3>11. Never Tell Your Mother She's Out Of Tune </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals</p><p>Clem Clempson: guitar</p><p>Dick Heckstall-Smith: saxophone</p><p>Art Themen: saxophone</p><p>Henry Lowther: trumpet</p><p>John Mumford: trombone</p><p>François Garny: bass</p><p>Simon Phillips: drums</p><p>One of my all time favorites. They could have played this one a bit faster. it's losing a bit of it's power, that was so typical for this song</p><hr/><h3>12. Theme For An Imaginary Western</h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, piano</p><p>Clem Clempson: guitar</p><p>Bernie Worrell: hammond organ</p><p>François Garny: bass</p><p>Simon Phillips; drums</p><p>Classical Jack Bruce song, performed also by several other bands / performers, such as Colosseum and Leslie West. i repeat myself, but Clem Clempson is doing a real great job in this concert. I love the contrast with the Gary Moore performances in this concert (Clem playing melodious, laid back and Gary playing more heavy).</p><hr/><h3>13. Golden Days </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, piano ;</p><p>Gary ~Mudbone~ Cooper: vocals</p><p>Clem Clempson: acoustic guitar</p><p>Bernie Worrell: hammond organ</p><p>François Garny: bass ;</p><p>Simon Phillips; drums</p><p>Jack and ~Mudbone~ complementing each other perfectly.</p><hr/><h3>14. Life On Earth </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, bass</p><p>Gary Moore: guitar</p><p>Simon Phillips: drums</p><p>From here the concert changes. Only guitar, bass and drums left, together of course with the vocals. I can be wrong, but I had the impression, looking at the concert, that Jack especially liked this part. Until this moment, the concert was good, but from here on it got more powerful, with plenty of room for improvising.</p><hr/><h3>15. NSU </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, bass</p><p>Gary Moore: guitar, vocals</p><p>Ginger Baker; drums</p><p>Ginger Baker joined here. He still knows how to play the drums, and his playing, as always, forms a perfect basis for improvisation. Gary Moore proves an excellent choice for an alternative to Eric Clapton. He feels perfectly how these songs have to be played. great guitar solos combined with bass playing as in the Cream days. The improvisations are extremely good, considering the fact that this is the first time Moore and Bruce play together (except for the fact that Jack has sung one song on the Moore album ~Corridors of Power~.</p><hr/><h3>16. Sitting On Top Of The World </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, bass</p><p>Gary Moore: guitar</p><p>Ginger Baker; drums</p><p>Another blues classic. I always liked this song on live Cream recordings, but I think this performance is even better.</p><hr/><h3>17. Politician </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, bass</p><p>Peter Brown: vocals</p><p>Gary Moore: guitar</p><p>Ginger Baker: drums</p><p>This song has been performed by Jack on several recordings, although this is the first time I hear Pete Brown, the writer of the lyrics, sing it. This performance of the song does not reach the quality / atmosphere as performed by West, Bruce &amp; Laing on their live album.</p><hr/><h3>18. Spoonful </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, bass</p><p>Gary Moore: guitar</p><p>Ginger Baker; drums</p><p>Another classic. Magnificent performance. It's played more ~staccato~ than Cream used to play it, but somehow this song needs that.</p><hr/><h3>19. Sunshine of your love </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, bass</p><p>Gary ~Mudbone~ Cooper</p><p>Clem Clempson: guitar</p><p>Malcolm Bruce; acoustic guitar</p><p>Dick Heckstall-Smith: saxophone</p><p>Art Themen: saxophone</p><p>Henry Lowther: trumpet</p><p>John Mumford: trombone</p><p>Bernie Worrell: hammond organ</p><p>Gary Husband: piano</p><p>Jonas Bruce: synthesizer</p><p>François Garny: bass</p><p>Ginger Baker: drums</p><p>Simon Phillips: drums</p><p>Pete Brown: percussion</p><p>The ~grand finale~ with this all time Cream classic.

		"biography": "<P>Roy Buchanan has long been considered one of the finest, yet criminally overlooked guitarists of the blues rock genre whose lyrical leads and use of harmonics would later influence such guitar greats as Jeff Beck, his one-time student Robbie Robertson, and ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons. Although born in Ozark, AR, on September 23, 1939, Buchanan grew up in the small town of Pixley, CA. His father was both a farmer and Pentecostal preacher, which would bring the youngster his first exposure to gospel music when his family would attend racially mixed revival meetings. But it was when Buchanan came across late-night R&amp;B radio shows that he became smitten by the blues, leading to Buchanan picking up the guitar at the age of seven. First learning steel guitar, he switched to electric guitar by the age of 13, finding the instrument that would one day become his trademark: a Fender Telecaster. By 15, Buchanan knew he wanted to concentrate on music full-time and relocated to Los Angeles, which contained a thriving blues/R&amp;B scene at the time. Shortly after his arrival in L.A., Buchanan was taken under the wing by multi-talented bluesman Johnny Otis, before studying blues with such players as Jimmy Nolen (later with James Brown), Pete Lewis, and Johnny ~Guitar~ Watson. During the mid- to late '50s, Buchanan led his own rock band, the Heartbeats, which soon after began backing rockabilly great Dale (~Suzy Q~) Hawkins.</P><P>By the dawn of the '60s, Buchanan had relocated once more, this time to Canada, where he signed on with rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins. The bass player of Ronnie Hawkins' backing band, the Hawks, studied guitar with Buchanan during his tenure with the band. Upon Buchanan's exit, the bassist-turned-guitarist would become the leader of the group, which would eventually become popular roots rockers the Band: Robbie Robertson. Buchanan spent the '60s as a sideman with obscure acts, as well as working as a session guitarist for such varied artists as pop idol Freddy Cannon, country artist Merle Kilgore, and drummer Bobby Gregg, among others, before Buchanan settled down in the Washington, D.C., area in the mid- to late '60s and founded his own outfit, the Snakestretchers. Despite not having appeared on any recordings of his own, word of Buchanan's exceptional playing skills began to spread among musicians as he received accolades from the likes of John Lennon, Eric Clapton, and Merle Haggard, as well as supposedly being invited to join the Rolling Stones at one point (which he turned down).</P><P>The praise eventually led to an hour-long public television documentary on Buchanan in 1971, the appropriately titled The Best Unknown Guitarist in the World, and a recording contract with Polydor Records shortly thereafter. Buchanan spent the remainder of the decade issuing solo albums, including such guitar classics as his 1972 self-titled debut (which contained one of Buchanan's best-known tracks, ~The Messiah Will Come Again~), 1974's That's What I Am Here For, and 1975's Live Stock, before switching to Atlantic for several releases. But by the '80s, Buchanan had grown disillusioned by the music business due to the record company's attempts to mold the guitarist into a more mainstream artist, which led to a four-year exile from music between 1981 and 1985. </P><P>Luckily, the blues label Alligator convinced Buchanan to begin recording again by the middle of the decade, issuing such solid and critically acclaimed releases as 1985's When a Guitar Plays the Blues, 1986's Dancing on the Edge, and 1987's Hot Wires. But just as his career seemed to be on the upswing once more, tragedy struck on August 14, 1988, when Buchanan was picked up by police in Fairfax, VA, for public intoxication. Shortly after being arrested and placed in a holding cell, a policeman performed a routine check on Buchanan and was shocked to discover that he had hung himself in his cell. Buchanan's stature as one of blues-rock's all-time great guitarist grew even greater after his tragic death, resulting in such posthumous collections as Sweet Dreams: The Anthology, Guitar on Fire: The Atlantic Sessions, Deluxe Edition, and 20th Century Masters.</P><P><B>— Greg Prato</B></P>",

				"review": "<p>The 16-tracks on this compilation are from Roy Buchanan's trio of mid-1970s titles: A Street Called Straight (1976), Loading Zone (1977), and You're Not Alone (1978). After a less than personally (or professionally) satisfying stint earlier in the decade with Polydor Records, Buchanan teamed up with Atlantic, who helped him get out of his pending contract with the former. Under the direction of Arif Mardin, the guitarist assembled the same instrumental support combo he'd used during his concurrent and practically incessant touring — John Harrison (bass), Malcolm Lukens (keyboards), and Byrd Foster (drums/vocals). The core quartet are augmented by all-stars Andy Newmark (drums), Will Lee (bass), Billy Cobham (percussion), the Brecker Brothers horn section, and even backing vocals from former Rascals member Eddie Brigati. The ferocious opening whine of ~Running Out~ is followed by Buchanan's nimble and liquefied tone, which enhances his otherwise bold and unabashed emotive leads. Specifically, the center solo exemplifies his remarkable ability to ably turn from a finely honed and sinister sound, to a divergent string stretching bluesy intonation. The reading of Jimi Hendrix' ~If Six Was Nine~ is nothing short of an inspired augmentation of the original. While Mardin's production on A Street Called Straight has been roundly criticized, there is a distinct progression from his previous studio releases, which were consistently hit-or-miss. Loading Zone is represented on this collection by no less than six of the LPs nine tunes. The effort was overseen by jazz bassist Stanley Clarke, and yields some thoroughly excellent material. Of top priority is the stretched-out Memphis groove on ~Green Onions,~ sporting contributions from Booker T. & the MG's personnel Steve Cropper (guitar) and Donald ~Duck~ Dunn (bass). Of equal note is ~Ramon's Blues,~ which commences this set, with riff upon riff of smouldering rounds of fretwork from Buchanan. You're Not Alone builds upon a spacey motif, right down to the astronaut headgear depicted in the cover artwork. Within the grooves are the languid and restrained ~Fly...Night Bird,~ as well as a pair of diverse cover versions of rock classics ~Turn to Stone~ (Joe Walsh) and ~Down by the River~ (Neil Young). After a blistering take-off, the former disintegrates, thanks to the rather uninspired smooth jazz arrangement, which is highlighted by Buchanan's intense fret board flurries. Vocalist Gary St. Clair fronts the soulful ~Down by the River,~ which is nowhere as essential as the live (and otherwise unavailable) rendering included on the two-disc Sweet Dreams: The Anthology (1992), or the decisive, if not definitive interpretation on Buck & the Snake Stretchers (1971). The ante is significantly raised, however, on the intense ~Supernova,~ which aptly reasserts Buchanan's proficiency. Although there is a bit of overlapping material, Guitar on Fire: The Atlantic Sessions (1993) is a great companion to the aforementioned Sweet Dreams: The Anthology as a worthwhile critical assessment of Roy Buchanan's sadly unrated status, reiterating his moniker as ~The World's Best Unknown Guitarist.~</p> <p><b>&mdash; Lindsay Planer</b></p>"

Sony released this live EP before his first fully produced rock album, Grace, perhaps to attract attention to the raw power of Buckley's greatest gift, his voice. These four songs certainly accomplished that end. Buckley hurdles seemingly unreachable octaves, suspends notes for what seems like minutes, and belts out his falsetto without a scintilla of restraint. That's a positive inasmuch as it allowed him to show off his considerable talent; it's a negative when it sounded like he was showing off. But his ten-minute cover of Van Morrison's ~The Way Young Lovers Do~ is a tour de force of strumming and scatting, and his acoustic ~Eternal Life~ has an electricity that is paradoxically lacking on the plugged-in album version.

				"review": "<p>Live From the Bataclan presents four songs from a 1995 performance in Paris. It captures the magic of an entranced, adoring (and surprisingly large, considering how short a time <i>Grace</i> had been out) audience as they listen to the vocal acrobatizing and seductive voice of Jeff Buckley. Overall, the selections are very quiet and tender — just voice and guitar — but the loud tune (and only one with the band) comes first: a slightly stretched out incarnation of ~Dream Brother,~ and a particularly throat-ripping, emotionally tortured rendition at that. Next comes a galloping 12-minute clap-along version of Van Morrison's ~The Way Young Lovers Do.~ By the time Buckley switches over to French during his delivery of a medley of ~Je N'En Connais Pas la Fin ~ and ~Hymne a L'Amour,~ the crowd erupts at the end of every phrase, catching him off guard with their enthusiasm. It gets to be a bit much, and the crowd almost manages to cut the song short with their enthusiastic approval, but the evident enjoyment of all present will be shared by fans. The last selection is a nearly 10-minute version of Leonard Cohen's ~Hallelujah.~ During it, the crowd momentarily becomes the backing choir, softly chanting ~hallelujah~ while Buckley takes it quieter until the song eventually dwindles out.</p>&mdash; <b>Joslyn Layne</b>"

				"review": "<p>Great artists dying before their time is not new to rock music. But there have been few whose brief career has been such a mystery as Jeff Buckley's -- certainly not in recent history. Maybe the recent release of Elliott Smith's posthumous From a Basement on the Hill will catapult him into the realm of the departed famous. But for now, it is the anti-hero Jeff Buckley who bears the full weight of having his career and its unrealized potential debated by the bored critic everywhere.</p><p>To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the release of his debut album Grace, Columbia Records released a three-disc set, including the original album, 12 outtakes, and a DVD that includes a documentary on the making of Grace and five videos.</p><p>The DVD is certainly interesting, and provides a nice look into the world that Andy Wallace and Jeff Buckley created at Bearsville Studios. Andy Wallace speaks about the recording process with more depth than most producers. It enables a closer look into Jeff Buckley's personality and provides some insight into the dynamic psyche that Buckley used to give birth to the now gigantic songs. Watching the Jeff Buckley interviews are interesting but at the same time disquieting. The entire documentary and all five videos seem permeated by the specter of Jeff Buckley.</p><p>It is not, however, the DVD that raises the most questions about Jeff Buckley's career, but rather the one new track on the disc of outtakes, the bluesy, soulful ~Forget Her.~ The song was ultimately scrapped at the last minute for the ethereal ~So Real~. That ~Forget Her~ has eluded release for as long as it has is surprising. It fully embodies, the feel of Grace, and would have sat nicely on the album. Jeff Buckley's voice and guitar is powerful and heartfelt. Listening to it (over and over) begs the question, ~Why did he decide not to release it as part of the album?~ In the stunningly packaged liner notes, Mary Guibert, offers the lucid explanation: ~It was for personal reasons that Jeff had removed it from the album.~ And herein lies the mystery that will always surround Jeff Buckley.</p><p>~Forget Her~ casts more shadows on his career than has already surrounded it. While it sounds at home on Grace, it seems to fit just as well in the body of songs he had begun work for what may or may not have been Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk. So, what was it going to be? Were we going to see a commercial follow up to Grace? Was it going to be the dark and gnarled guitar of ~Nightmares By the Sea~? It is likely the only answer given (if one were given it all) would be, ~Jeff didn't discuss it for personal reasons.~ Often this comment can be interpreted to mean the artist is cracking up or battling with drugs. With the mercurial Jeff Buckley it means only that he wasn't telling because he was likely going to change his mind.</p><p>The shroud over his career is also a result of such a limited body of work. Jeff Buckley was not a prolific songwriter like many of his idols. Or, if he was, he wasn't telling anyone. It is unfortunate, not because fans jealously hang on every note he sings, but because the Legacy Edition is limited in its ability to truly capture his fragile genius.</p><p>Also contained here are stirring renditions of ~Lost Highway~ by Bob Dylan and Nina Simone's ~The Other Woman~. More impressive is the soulful track ~I Want Someone Badly~, which Buckley performs with the band, Shudder to Think. The cut finds him in '60s R&B territory, and his voice doesn't disappoint.</p><p>Some of the tracks contained on the Legacy Edition are culled from previous compilations and EPs; so many buyers will already have them. However, the intimate lost track ~Forget Her~ and the documentary are worth the purchase alone. Jeff Buckley brought a depth to his music and the world he lived in that is uncommon, to say the least. Colombia has sought to capture it, and does a reasonably good job, even if they fail to shed any new light on the enigma of Jeff Buckley's legacy.</p>&mdash; <b>David Brecheisen</b><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>Jeff Buckley's tragically early death surely did something to immortalize his one and only full-length album, but even so, Grace is without doubt a truly musical monument, spanning time and space and perpetually blowing fresh minds round the globe (and quite possibly somewhere beyond).</p><p>His voice is multi-textured and he uses notes to dramatic effect - the agony and the ecstasy of it hitting you straight in the gut. His music is so extraordinary, in fact, that it's impossible to put this album on in the background without being drawn into its psyche.  Don't just listen - experience, be mesmerized, take a trip.</p></p>This re-mastered Legacy edition of Grace includes a second CD of unreleased material and rarities, plus a DVD of promo videos and an expanded version of the original Grace documentary.  The question is, is it worth having over the original?</p><p>The answer is a definite yes, its main selling point being the fact that the second CD, dare I say it, is practically as good as the first.</p><p>It highlights his interest and accomplishment in diverse genres and consolidates his status as a musical pioneer.</p><p>Out of the 13 songs, highlights include ~Forget Her~, a stunningly beautiful song that sends the emotions tearing and tingling out the ends of your fingers. ~Kanga Roo~ is 14 minutes of abrasive, mind melting insanity, ~Parchman Farm Blues~ which hears Buckley capturing perfectly the meter and pitch of an old blues sound and the thrash rock-ness of ~Eternal Life~.</p><p>So, 10 years after the original release of this seminal album, the legacy edition is indeed a credit to his name.  There is poignancy to watching the man on film and you can't help wondering, as with all artists cut off in their prime, what may have been.</p><p>Listen and be purged.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephanie Barrow</b>"

		"biography": "<p>Few American groups have produced a wealth of talent like that of Buffalo Springfield. The group's formation is the stuff of legend: driving on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, <a href=~/cg/x.dll?p=amg&sql=B5535~>Stephen Stills</a> and Richie Furay spotted a hearse that Stills was sure belonged to <a href=~/cg/x.dll?p=amg&sql=B5896~>Neil Young</a>, a Canadian he had crossed paths with earlier. Indeed it was, and with the addition of fellow hearse passenger and Canadian Bruce Palmer on bass and ex-Dillard Dewey Martin on drums, the cluster of ex-folkies determined, as the Byrds had just done, to become a rock & roll band.</p><p>Over a 19-month period, during 1967 and 1968, Buffalo Springfield released three impressive albums. Their debut, including their sole big hit (Stills' ~For What It's Worth~), established them as the best folk-rock band in the land baring the Byrds, though the Springfield were a bit more folk and country oriented. The second, <a href=~/cg/x.dll?p=amg&sql=A2904~><i>Buffalo Springfield Again</i></a>, is their masterpiece, as the group expanded their folk-rock base into tough hard rock and psychedelic orchestration. Possessing three strong songwriters with distinctly different yet complementary styles -- Stills, Young, and Furay (the last of whom didn't begin writing until the second LP) -- they also had strong and often conflicting egos, particularly Stills and Young. The group, which held almost infinite promise, rearranged their lineup several times, Young leaving the group for periods and Palmer fighting deportation, until disbanding in 1968. Their final album, although it contained some excellent material, clearly shows the group fragmenting into solo directions.</p><p>Even more than the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield's sound was undeniably American, drawing from rock, folk, and country. The intense clash of creative energies, however, finally caused the demise of the band in May of 1968. <a href=~/cg/x.dll?p=amg&sql=B5535~>Stephen Stills</a> went on to <a href=~/cg/x.dll?p=amg&sql=B3996~>Crosby, Stills & Nash</a>. <a href=~/cg/x.dll?p=amg&sql=B5896~>Neil Young</a> joined that group briefly for <a href=~/cg/x.dll?p=amg&sql=A34338~><i>Deja Vu</i></a>, then went on to pursue an erratic solo career with periods of great success and brilliant music. After Springfield, Jim Messina and Richie Furay founded the country-rock group Poco. After Poco, Messina recorded a string of hits during the '70s with Kenny Loggins, as <a href=~/cg/x.dll?p=amg&sql=B4779~>Loggins & Messina</a>.</p><p><b> Rick Clark & Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide</b><br>",

		"artistid": 619,
		"firstname": "The",
		"lastname": "Butterfield Blues Band",
		"name": "The Butterfield Blues Band",
		"biography": "<p>Paul Butterfield was the first white harmonica player to develop a style original and powerful enough to place him in the pantheon of true blues greats. It's impossible to overestimate the importance of the doors Butterfield opened: before he came to prominence, white American musicians treated the blues with cautious respect, afraid of coming off as inauthentic. Not only did Butterfield clear the way for white musicians to build upon blues tradition (instead of merely replicating it), but his storming sound was a major catalyst in bringing electric Chicago blues to white audiences who'd previously considered acoustic Delta blues the only really genuine article. His initial recordings from the mid-'60s -- featuring the legendary, racially integrated first edition of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band -- were eclectic, groundbreaking offerings that fused electric blues with rock & roll, psychedelia, jazz, and even (on the classic East-West) Indian classical music. As members of that band -- which included Michael Bloomfield and Elvin Bishop -- drifted away, the overall impact of Butterfield's music lessened, even if his amplified harp playing was still beyond reproach. He had largely faded from the scene by the mid-'70s, and fell prey to health problems and drug addiction that sadly claimed his life prematurely. Even so, the enormity of Butterfield's initial impact ensured that his legacy was already secure.</p><p>Butterfield was born December 17, 1942, in Chicago and grew up in Hyde Park, a liberal, integrated area on the city's South Side. His father, a lawyer, and mother, a painter, encouraged Butterfield's musical studies from a young age, and he took flute lessons up through high school, with the first-chair flutist in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra serving as his private tutor for a time. By this time, however, Butterfield was growing interested in the blues music that permeated the South Side; he and college-age friend Nick Gravenites (a future singer, guitarist, and songwriter in his own right) began hitting the area blues clubs in 1957. Butterfield was inspired to take up guitar and harmonica, and he and Gravenites began playing together on college campuses around the Midwest. After being forced to turn down a track scholarship to Brown University because of a knee injury, Butterfield entered the University of Illinois-Chicago, where he met a fellow white blues fan in guitarist Elvin Bishop. Butterfield was evolving into a decent singer, and not long after meeting Bishop, he focused all his musical energy on the harmonica, developing his technique (mostly on diatonic harp, not chromatic) and tone; he soon dropped out of college to pursue music full-time.</p><p>After some intense woodshedding, Butterfield and Bishop began making the rounds of the South Side's blues clubs, sitting in whenever they could. They were often the only whites present, but were quickly accepted because of their enthusiasm and skill. In 1963, the North Side club Big John's offered Butterfield's band a residency; he'd already recruited Howlin' Wolf's rhythm section -- bassist Jerome Arnold and drummer Sam Lay -- by offering more money, and replaced original guitarist Smokey Smothers with his friend Bishop. The new quartet made an instant splash with their hard-driving versions of Chicago blues standards. In late 1964, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band was discovered by producer Paul Rothchild, and after adding lead guitarist Michael Bloomfield, they signed to Elektra and recorded several sessions for a debut album, the results of which were later scrapped.</p><p>At first, there was friction between Butterfield and Bloomfield, since the harmonica man patterned his bandleading style after taskmasters like Howlin' Wolf and Little Walter; after a few months, though, their respect for each other's musical skills won out, and they began sitting in together at blues clubs around the city. A song from their aborted first session, the Nick Gravenites-penned ~Born in Chicago,~ was included on the Elektra sampler Folksong '65 and created a strong buzz about the band. In the summer of 1965, they re-entered the studio for a second crack at their debut album, adding organist Mark Naftalin as a permanent sixth member during the sessions. In the meantime, they were booked to play that year's Newport Folk Festival. When Bob Dylan witnessed their well-received performance at an urban blues workshop during the festival, he recruited Butterfield's band to back him for part of his own set later that evening. Roundly booed by acoustic purists, Dylan's plugged-in performance with the Butterfield Band ultimately shook the folk world to its foundations, kickstarting an electric folk-rock movement that effectively spelled the end of the traditionalist folk revival.</p><p>On the heels of their historic performance at Newport, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band released their self-titled debut album later in 1965. Now regarded as a classic, the LP caused quite a stir among white blues fans who had never heard electric Chicago-style blues performed by anyone besides British blues-rock groups. Not only did it sow the seeds of a thousand bar bands, but it also helped introduce more white listeners to the band's influences, especially Muddy Waters and B.B. King. Toward the end of 1965, drummer Sam Lay fell ill and was replaced by the jazz-trained Billy Davenport, whose rhythmic agility and sophistication soon made him a permanent member. He was particularly useful since Butterfield was pushing to expand the band's sound, aided by Bloomfield's growing interest in Eastern music, especially Ravi Shankar. Their growing eclecticism manifested itself on their second album, 1966's East-West, which remains their greatest achievement. The title cut was a lengthy instrumental suite incorporating blues, jazz, rock, psychedelia, and raga; although it became their signature statement, the rest of the album was equally inspired, perhaps due in part to Butterfield's more relaxed, democratic approach to bandleading.<p><p>Unfortunately, Mike Bloomfield left the band at the height of its success in 1967, and formed a new group called the Electric Flag with Nick Gravenites, which aspired to take East-West's eclecticism even further. Bishop moved into the lead guitar slot for the band's third album, 1967's The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw (a reference to Bishop's nickname). Displaying a greater soul influence, the album also featured a new rhythm section in bassist Bugsy Maugh and drummer Phil Wilson, plus a horn section that included a young David Sanborn. Pigboy Crabshaw proved to be the closing point of the Butterfield Band's glory days; the 1968 follow-up, In My Own Dream, was uneven in its songwriting and focus, and both Elvin Bishop and Mark Naftalin left the band before year's end. Still hoping for a breakout commercial hit, Elektra brought in producer/songwriter Jerry Ragovoy, a longtime R&B professional, which marked the first time they'd asserted control over a Butterfield recording. That didn't sit well with Butterfield, who wanted to move in a jazzier direction than Ragovoy's radio-friendly style allowed; the result, 1969's Keep on Moving, was another inconsistent outing, despite the return of Billy Davenport and an injection of energy from the band's new guitarist, 19-year-old Buzzy Feiten. 1969 wasn't a washout for Butterfield, though; his band was still popular enough to make the bill at Woodstock, and he also took part in an all-star Muddy Waters session dubbed Fathers and Sons, which showcased the Chicago giant's influence on the new generation of bluesmen and greatly broadened his audience.</p><p>After 1970's Live and the following year's studio effort Sometimes I Just Feel Like Smilin', Butterfield broke up his band and parted ways with Elektra. Tired of all the touring and personnel turnover, he retreated to the communal atmosphere of Woodstock, still a musicians' haven in the early '70s, and in 1971 formed a new group eventually dubbed Better Days. Guitarist Amos Garrett and drummer Chris Parker were the first to join, and with folk duo Geoff and Maria Muldaur in tow, the band was initially fleshed out by organist Merl Saunders and bassist John Kahn, both from San Francisco. Sans Geoff Muldaur, this aggregation worked on the soundtrack of the film Steelyard Blues, but Saunders and Kahn soon returned to the Bay Area, and were replaced by New Orleans pianist Ronnie Barron and Taj Mahal bassist Billy Rich. This lineup -- with Geoff Muldaur back, plus contributions from singer/songwriter Bobby Charles -- released the group's first album, Better Days, in 1972 on Butterfield manager Albert Grossman's new Bearsville label. While it didn't quite match up to Butterfield's earliest efforts, it did return him to critical favor. A follow-up, It All Comes Back, was released in 1973 to positive response, and in 1975 he backed Muddy Waters once again on The Woodstock Album, the last LP release ever on Chess.</p><p>Butterfield subsequently pursued a solo career, with diminishing returns. His Henry Glover-produced solo debut, Put It in Your Ear, appeared in 1976, but failed to impress many: his harmonica playing was pushed away from the spotlight, and the material was erratic at best. The same year, he appeared in the Band's farewell concert film, The Last Waltz. Over the next few years, Butterfield mostly confined himself to session work; he attempted a comeback in 1981 with legendary Memphis soul producer Willie Mitchell, but the sessions -- released as North-South -- were burdened by synthesizers and weak material. By this time, Butterfield's health was in decline; years of heavy drinking were beginning to catch up to him, and he also contracted peritonitis, a painful intestinal condition. At some point -- none of his friends knew quite when -- Butterfield also developed an addiction to heroin; he'd been stridently opposed to it as a bandleader, leading to speculation that he was trying to ease his peritonitis symptoms. He began to play more gigs in Los Angeles during the early '80s, and eventually relocated there permanently; he also toured on a limited basis during the mid-'80s, and in 1986 released his final album, The Legendary Paul Butterfield Rides Again. However, his addiction was bankrupting him, and in the past half-decade he'd seen Mike Bloomfield, Muddy Waters, and manager Albert Grossman pass away, each loss leaving him shaken. On May 4, 1987, Butterfield himself died of a drug overdose; he was not quite 45 years old.</p>&mdash; <b>Steve Huey</b>",

Hite was nicknamed ~The Bear~ and stalked the stage in the time-honored tradition of <a href=~/cg/x.dll?p=amg&sql=B60993~>Howlin' Wolf</a> and other large-proportioned bluesmen. Wilson was an extraordinary harmonica player, with a fat tone and great vibrato. His work on guitar, especially in open tunings (he played on Son House's rediscovery recordings of the mid-'60s, incidentally) gave the band a depth and texture that most other rhythm players could only aspire to.

After two big chart hits with ~Goin' up the Country~ and an explosive version of Wilbert Harrison's ~Let's Work Together,~ Wilson died under mysterious (probably drug-related) circumstances in 1970, and Hite carried on with various reconstituted versions of the band until his death just before a show in 1981, from a heart seizure.</p><p>Still, the surving members -- led by drummer Adolfo ~Fito~ de la Parra -- continued touring and recording, recruiting new vocalist Walter Trout; he was replaced in 1985 by James Thornbury, who fronted the band for the next decade. After Thornbury exited in 1995, Canned Heat tapped Robert Lucas to assume lead vocal duties; they soon recorded <a href=~/cg/x.dll?p=amg&sql=2THE|CANNED|HEAT|BLUES~><i>The Canned Heat Blues Band</i></a>, which sadly was Vestine's last recording with the group -- he died in Paris in December 1997 in the wake of the band's recent tour. <i>Boogie 2000</i> followed two years later.</p><p><b>Cub Koda & Bruce Eder, All Music Guide</b></p>",

		"firstname": "The",
		"lastname": "Carter Family",
		"name": "The Carter Family",
		"biography": "<p>The Carter Family have become known as country music's first family and are responsible for several songs such as ~Wildwood Flower~ and ~Keep On The Sunny Side~ becoming country standards. The original three members of the Carter Family were A.P. Carter (b. Alvin Pleasant Delaney Carter, 15 April 1891, Maces Springs, Scott County, Virginia, USA, d. 7 November 1960, Maces Springs), his wife Sara Carter (b. Sara Dougherty, 21 July 1898, Flat Woods, Coeburn, Wise County, Virginia, USA, d. 8 January 1979, Lodi, California, USA) and Sara's cousin, Mother Maybelle Carter (b. Maybelle Addington, 10 May 1909, Copper Creek, Nickelsville, Scott County, Virginia, USA, d. 23 October 1978, Nashville, Tennessee, USA). A.P, also known as ~Doc~, Carter began to play the fiddle as a boy and learned many old-time songs from his mother. His father had been a fiddler but gave it up through religious beliefs when he married. As a young man, A.P. sang in a quartet with two uncles and his eldest sister in the local church. Initially, he worked on the railroad in Indiana but became homesick for his Clinch Mountain home in Virginia and in 1911, returned to his native area. He became interested in writing songs and found work travelling, selling fruit trees.</p><p>One day on his travels, he met Sara, who (legend says) was playing the autoharp and singing ~Engine 143~, and on 18 June 1915, they married. Sara had learned to play banjo, guitar and autoharp and, as a child, was regularly singing with Madge and Maybelle Addington and other friends in her local area. They made their home in Maces Springs where A.P. worked on varying jobs, including farming and gardening and began to appear singing and playing together at local church socials and other functions. They auditioned for Brunswick Records, singing such songs as ~Log Cabin By The Sea', but when the record company suggested to A.P. that, performing as Fiddlin' Doc, he only record square dance fiddle songs, he flatly refused because he felt it was against his mother and father's strong religious beliefs. After her marriage in 1926 to A.P.~s brother Ezra J. Carter, Maybelle (Addington) joined with her relatives and the trio began to entertain locally. Like her new sister-in-law, Maybelle was equally competent on guitar, banjo and autoharp and was to become the main instrumentalist of the trio, as she developed her immediately identifiable style of picking out the melody on the bass strings and strumming a backing on the treble (Maybelle may well have been influenced by black guitarist Leslie Riddle, who often accompanied A.P. when he went on his searching-for-songs trips). Sara, often playing chords on the autoharp, usually sang lead vocals, with A.P. providing bass and Maybelle alto harmonies (Sara also yodelled on some of their recordings although this was probably more the instruction of the record company's producer than her own free choice).</p><p>The Carter Family sound was something totally new. Vocals in the early folk and hillbilly music were usually of secondary importance to the instrumental work, whereas the trio, with their simple harmonies, used their instruments to provide a musical accompaniment that never took precedent over their vocal work. In July 1927, their local newspaper reported that Ralph Peer of Victor Records was to audition local artists in Bristol, Tennessee. In spite of the fact that Sara had three children (the youngest only seven months old) and that Maybelle was seven months pregnant with her first, they travelled the 25 miles to Bristol, where on 1 August, they made their first recordings. They recorded six tracks. Peer was impressed and the records proved sufficient sellers for Victor to secure them a recording contract. Between 1928 and 1935, they recorded many tracks for Victor, including the original versions of many of their classics such as ~Keep On The Sunny Side~, ~Wildwood Flower~, ~I'm Thinking Tonight Of My Blue Eyes~, ~Homestead On The Farm~ (aka ~I Wonder How The Old Folks Are At Home~), ~Jimmie Brown The Newsboy~ and ~Wabash Cannonball~.</p><p>By the end of the 20s, the Carter Family was a very well-known act. In 1931 in Louisville, Kentucky, they met and recorded with Jimmie Rodgers. It was at this session that Rodgers made his only valid duet recordings with a female vocalist when he recorded ~Why There's A Tear In My Eye~ and ~The Wonderful City~ with Sara Carter (the latter song also being the only sacred number that Rodgers ever recorded). Combined recordings made at this time between the two acts comprised ~Jimmie Rodgers Visits The Carter Family~ and ~The Carter Family And Jimmie Rodgers In Texas~. The former consisted of duets by Sara and Maybelle on ~My Clinch Mountain Home~ and ~Little Darling Pal Of Mine~, with Jimmie Rodgers and A.P both joining on a quartet version of ~Hot Time In The Old Town Tonight~. The latter featured Jimmie Rodgers with a solo version of ~Yodelling Cowboy~ and Sara joining in with the vocal and yodel on ~T For Texas~. Both also included some talking by the two acts. The Carter Family managed to record, even though the families at times had moved apart. In 1929, A.P. relocated to Detroit to find work and at one time, Maybelle moved to Washington, DC.</p><p>In 1932, Sara and A.P separated; they divorced a few years later, but the trio continued to record and perform together (later, in 1939, Sara married A.P's cousin, Coy Bayes). In 1935 they left Victor and moved to ARC, where they re-recorded some of their popular earlier songs, though often using different arrangements, as well as recording new numbers. They signed to Decca Records in 1936 and later recorded for Columbia Records (formerly ARC). Their previous reluctance to perform outside of Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina ended in 1938, when they accepted the opportunity to work on the powerful Border Radio stations XERA, XEG and XENT on the Mexican/Texas border at Del Rio and San Antonio. Here the Carter's children began to make appearances with the family; first, Sara's daughter Janette and Maybelle's daughter Anita Carter, followed soon afterwards by her sisters Helen Carter and Valerie June Carter (b. 23 June 1929, Maces Spring, Virginia, USA, d. 15 May 2003).</p><p>Apart from their normal studio recordings, they recorded radio transcription discs at this time, which were used on various stations and helped to increase their popularity. They remained in Texas until 1941, when they relocated to WBT Charlotte, North Carolina. In 14 October 1941, after rejoining Victor, the trio made their final recordings together; in 1943, while still at WBT, Sara decided to retire and the original Carter Family broke up. During their career, they recorded almost three hundred songs, never once varying from their traditional sound. A.P. claimed to have written many of them and the arguments still persist as to just how many were his own compositions and how many were traditional numbers that he had learned as a boy or found on his many song-searching trips. Sara Carter was undeniably a vocalist of great talent and could easily have become a successful solo artist. Maybelle Carter, apart from her instrumental abilities, was also a fine vocalist. A.P, who possessed a deep bass voice, was a very nervous man who suffered with palsy for many years. Some people believe this accounted for the tremolo on his voice at times and for the fact that he was often either late with his vocal, or failed to sing at all.</p><p>The influence of the Carter Family can be seen in the work of a great many artists and their songs have been recorded by the likes of Johnny Cash, Louvin Brothers, Emmylou Harris, Mac Wiseman, Flatt And Scruggs, Bill Monroe and Stonewall Jackson. They recorded the ~Wabash Cannonball~ seven years before Roy Acuff first sang it; this and many other Carter songs have become standards and have been recorded by many artists. Many of their numbers were beautifully descriptive of their native state, such as ~Mid The Green Fields Of Virginia~, ~My Clinch Mountain Home~ and ~My Little Home In Tennessee~. Several of Woody Guthrie's best-known songs used Carter Family tunes including ~This Land Is Your Land~ (~When The World's On Fire~) and ~Reuben James~ (~Wildwood Flower~). He also regularly performed ~It Takes A Worried Man~, which the Carters sang as ~Worried Man Blues~. Other folk artists influenced by their music include Joan Baez, who recorded many of their songs such as ~Little Darling Pal Of Mine~ and ~Will The Circle Be Unbroken~. After the break-up of the original trio, Maybelle and her three daughters began to perform on the Old Dominion Barn Dance on WRVA Richmond. They appeared as Mother Maybelle and The Carter Sisters and were a popular act between 1943 and 1948.</p><p>After spells at WNOX Knoxville and KWTO Springfield, they moved to WSM Nashville and joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1950, taking with them a young guitarist called Chet Atkins. During the 50s, Helen and Anita left to marry and pursue their own careers and June became a solo act. Maybelle remained a featured star of the Grand Ole Opry until 1967, when she was rejoined by Helen and Anita. In 1961, Maybelle even recorded an album of Carter Family songs with Flatt And Scruggs and in 1963, she appeared at the Newport Folk Festival. After June married singer Johnny Cash in 1968, Maybelle, Helen and Anita became regular members of the Johnny Cash Show. They had begun to make appearances with Cash the previous year. A.P retired to Maces Springs, where he opened a country store and lived with his daughter Gladys. Sara and her husband moved to Angel's Camp, California, where she withdrew from active participation in the music scene.</p><p>In 1952, seemingly at the request of her ex-husband, she was persuaded to record once more. Between 1952 and 1956, the A.P. Carter Family, consisting of Sara, A.P. and their son and daughter Joe Carter (b. 27 February 1927, Maces Springs, Virginia, USA) and Janette Carter (b. 2 July 1923, Maces Springs, Virginia, USA), recorded almost 100 tracks for Acme Records. These included a 1956 recording made with Mrs. Jimmie Rodgers, which consisted of talk and a version of ~In The Sweet Bye And Bye~. Although these recordings never matched the work of the original trio, they did maintain traditional standards, whereas Maybelle and her daughters moved to a more modern country sound. In 1953, A.P. opened his ~Summer Park~ in his beloved Clinch Mountains, near the home of Joe and Janette, and held concerts that featured such artists as the Stanley Brothers. A.P. Carter died at his home in Maces Springs on 7 November 1960. After A.P's death record companies began to release their material on album for the first time. In 1967 Sara was persuaded to appear with Maybelle at the Newport Folk Festival; the same year she and Maybelle, with Joe Carter taking his late father's bass part, recorded their classic An Historic Reunion album, which included their rather nostalgic ~Happiest Days Of All~. It was recorded in Nashville. The trio surprised the recording engineers by recording 12 tracks in just over four hours - an unusual event. It was the first time the two had recorded together for 25 years (in 1991, Bear Family Records reissued these recordings, plus a version of ~No More Goodbyes~ that had not been released by Columbia, on a compact disc; it also contained a reissue of Mother Maybelle's 1966 album A Living Legend, and a further previously unissued recording of her instrumental ~Mama's Irish Jig~).</p><p>In 1970, Sara and Maybelle were both present when the Original Carter Family became the first group ever to be elected to the Country Music Hall Of Fame And Museum. Their plaque stated that the Carter Family are ~regarded by many as the epitome of country greatness and originators of a much copied style~. Maybelle Carter, a most respected member of the country music world, continued to perform until her death in Nashville on 23 October 1978. Sara Carter died in Lodi, California, after a long illness, on 8 January 1979. June Carter died in May 2003 just a few months before her husband Johnny Cash died. The Carter Family inspired other groups to reproduce their sound, notably the Phipps Family of Kentucky, who among their many albums recorded tributes to the Carters such as Echoes Of The Carter Family and Most Requested Sacred Songs Of The Carter Family. Further afield, the Canadian Romaniuk Family also showed their ability to recapture the Carter Family sound with albums such as Country Carter Style.</p>",

		"firstname": "Martin",
		"lastname": "Carthy",
		"name": "Martin Carthy",
		"biography": "<p>If the English folk revival of the 1960s had a single ~father~ and guiding spirit, then Martin Carthy was it. Carthy's influence transcends his abilities, formidable though those are -- apart from being one of the most talented acoustic guitarists, mandolinists, and general multi-instrumentalists working the folk clubs in the 1960s, he was also a powerful singer with no pretensions or affectations, and was an even more prodigious arranger and editor, with an excellent ear for traditional compositions. In particular, he was as much a scholar as a performer, and frequently went back to the notes and notebooks of folk song collectors such as Percy Grainger, scouring them for fragments that could be made whole in performance -- no ~second hander,~ he used the earliest known transcriptions and recordings of many of the oldest folk songs known in England as his source, and worked from there. By 1966, at the time he was cutting his first two albums, Carthy was already an influence on Bob Dylan and Paul Simon, and by the end of the 1960s was de facto mentor to virtually every serious aspiring folk musician in England. At least three major English folk-rock bands, Fairport Convention, Steeleye Span, and the Albion Band, were formed either directly or indirectly with his help and influence.</p><p>Surprisingly given his musical prowess, Carthy didn't initially set out to be a musician. Upon leaving school, he served as an assistant stage manager for different theatrical companies, and only gradually drifted into performing in the coffeehouses springing up around London during the late '50s and early '60s, as skiffle, with its heavy American influence, was supplanted by more specifically British material. He joined Redd Sullivan, Marion Gray, and Pete Maynard in a group called the Thameside Four, and sang with them for three years, until his reputation had grown sufficiently, and the demand from the clubs in London was such that he began making solo appearances. He became the resident singer at a folk club called the Troubadour in London, and during that time he recorded a four-song extended-play single for Topic Records that got lost somewhere between the studio and the pressing plant.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/mc-wednesday.jpg~ alt=~Wednesday Morning, 3 AM~><p>Still, he had an audience, and among those listening was a pair of Americans who happened to be in England at the time. One who heard Carthy perform his arrangement of the traditional song ~Scarborough Fair~ was Paul Simon, who was trying for a folksinging career in London following the failure of the very first Simon & Garfunkel album (Wednesday Morning, 3 AM) back in America. Carthy gave Simon his arrangement, chords, and words for the song, and it became the basis for Simon's own version when he returned to the United States. Another American working around London in 1965 was Bob Dylan, in London appearing in a television play called Madhouse on Castle Street (wherein a teenager named Duncan Brown heard his guitar playing and decided to become a musician, recording one classic '60s album). Dylan heard Carthy's version of ~Lord Franklin~ and transformed the melody into ~Bob Dylan's Dream~ for the album Freewheelin', which also mentions Carthy in the liner notes.</p><p>Carthy made his recording debut on the English Decca anthology album Hootenanny, but neither song was really representative of Carthy's work. ~My Baby Has Gorn Dahn the Plug 'Ole~ and ~The End of My Old Cigar~ provided what he later referred to as comic relief amid the earnestness of the rest of the compilation. His big influences, in addition to the expected folk song collectors and arrangers such as A.L. Lloyd, included Ravi Shankar (Carthy had attended the latter's first London performance in 1957) and Davy Graham, whose version of ~She Moved Through the Fair~ encouraged his interest in Indian music. By the mid-'60s, Carthy was a musical polymath, drawing inspiration from music all over the map, although his repertoire came entirely from the British Isles.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/mc-martin-carthy.jpg~ alt=~Martin Carthy~><p>In 1965, Carthy was signed to Fontana Records and recorded his debut album, Martin Carthy, that same year, which contained his arrangement of ~Scarborough Fair~ and featured contributions from fiddler Dave Swarbrick as a performer and co-arranger. From the very first, Carthy's records became songbooks for thousands of lesser performers and less ambitious would-be folk musicians -- he literally was the Bob Dylan of the English folk revival, without the feigned anger or the affectations, but with all of the skill and depth. That first album was also the first manifestation of what eventually became a more formal partnership with Swarbrick. That didn't begin, however, until March of 1966, when the violinist found himself turned back by Dutch customs officials while traveling to Denmark -- Carthy offered to team up with Swarbrick on an upcoming tour with a 50/50 split of the proceeds. Their recording situation was more complicated, due to the fact that Carthy was signed to Fontana as a solo artist, and the record company wouldn't modify the contract -- they were never able to split the revenues of their recordings during the 1960s, a situation that never hurt their working relationship. The two ended up recording six long-players and an extended-play single between 1966 and 1969 (at around that time, Swarbrick went off to join Fairport Convention). Their records, all carefully programmed and recorded (each new song was a surprise: a solo number by Carthy might be followed by a work featuring the two of them, followed by an a cappella number by Carthy), sold well among folk enthusiasts, and put both Carthy and Swarbrick on the map nationally.</p><p>Carthy became not only one of the most popular folksingers in England but, more than that, a musical resource. Unlike most of his rivals, Carthy respected original -- or at least the earliest known -- versions of the songs he performed, and where possible he would go back to field recordings done early in the 20th century. One of Carthy's specialties was finding and completing fragments of songs that didn't exist in complete versions -- not only did this add dozens of songs to the repertoire (usually played and heard by people who had no inkling of the editorial and musical skills that had gone into making the songs ~whole~), but it gave Carthy a starting point very far from the superficial commercial folk-rock that was typical of the 1960s. His use of primary sources allowed him to pick up nuances from the songs that most of his rivals never guessed were there. Additionally, he was open to recording original material, if it were the right material under the right circumstances, and several of his 1960s albums feature songs by his friend, songwriter Leon Rosselson. Coupled with his vocal and guitar skills, all of this made Carthy perhaps the most important folksinger in England, as a source of inspiration, a conduit for songs, and a model for how to approach the music.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/mc-battle.jpg~ alt=~Battle of the Field~><p>By 1970, however, a modern group beckoned Carthy in the form of Steeleye Span, which had been formed by Ashley Hutchings, Tim Hart, and Maddy Prior in the wake of Hutchings' exit from Fairport Convention. Unlike Fairport Convention, which freely mixed original and traditional material, Steeleye Span played traditional folk music, albeit on a mix of electric and acoustic instruments (they didn't have a drummer at this time), and Carthy became something of their resident sage and musicologist -- the group inherited and adopted many songs that he had recorded during the 1960s. By 1972, he was out of Steeleye Span and recording on his own again. That same year, he married Norma Waterson and became a member of her family's folksinging group, the Watersons, of which he has remained an active member. He also became a member of the Albion Band, the group formed by Hutchings in the early '70s, working with them on the album Battle of the Field. During the 1970s, Carthy also began doing theater work, which led to the formation of the group Brass Monkey in the early '80s.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/mc-skin-Bone.jpg~ alt=~Skin & Bone~><p>Carthy revived his partnership with Dave Swarbrick again in the 1980s, and the two have continued to perform and record together in the ensuing decades, issuing Skin & Bone in 1992 and Straws in the Wind in 2006, both on the Topic label. The Carthy solo efforts Right of Passage (1988), Signs of Life (1999), and Waiting for Angels (2004) were released on Topic as well. All of Martin Carthy's classic albums on Topic and Fontana are available on compact disc.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>",

Also here is ~Two Magicians,~ a song that later entered the repertory Steeleye Span, and ~Lovely Joan,~ a folk song that is most familiar to classical listeners as the source of the counter-melody to Ralph Vaughan Williams' ~Fantasia on Greensleeves.~ The playing and the interpretations are somewhat less ambitious and rather rougher than subsequent efforts, with Dave Swarbrick guesting on fiddle on about half the tracks, and Carthy's guitar covering all but the acapella tracks.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

The results are less spontaneous than their earlier work, but also show a level of professionalism that few folk albums of the era ever demonstrated. The differences lie in the careful nuances, and the sophistication of the paired voice and instruments, which are much more studied than anything previously heard. The music is glorious in its own unassuming way--Carthy's acapella performance on the haunting ~Brigg Fair~ (a Lincolnshire tune originally collected by Percy Grainger, and which was the basis for a classical piece by Frederick Delius), the interweaving of Carthy's voice and Swarbrick's violin on ~The Bloody Gardener,~ the dazzling title track, and maybe the best version of ~John Barleycorn~ ever recorded, are among 14 of the most prized songs in their careers.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

		"name": "Nick Cave",
		"biography": "<p>After goth pioneers the Birthday Party called it quits in 1983, singer/songwriter Nick Cave assembled the Bad Seeds, a post-punk supergroup featuring former Birthday Party guitarist Mick Harvey on drums, ex-Magazine bassist Barry Adamson, and Einstürzende Neubauten guitarist Blixa Bargeld. With the Bad Seeds, Cave continued to explore his obsessions with religion, death, love, America, and violence with a bizarre, sometimes self-consciously eclectic hybrid of blues, gospel, rock, and arty post-punk, although in a more subdued fashion than his work with the Birthday Party. Cave also allowed his literary aspirations to come to the forefront; the lyrics are narrative prose, heavy on literary allusions and myth-making, and take some inspiration from Leonard Cohen. Cave's gloomy lyrics, dark musical arrangements, and deep baritone voice recall the albums of Scott Walker, who also obsessed over death and love with a frightening passion. However, Cave brings a hefty amount of post-punk experimentalism to Walker's epic dark pop.</p><p>Cave released his first album with the Bad Seeds, From Her to Eternity, in 1984, which contained a noteworthy cover of Elvis Presley's ~In the Ghetto,~ foreshadowing much of Cave's style and subject matter on the follow-up The Firstborn Is Dead. Kicking Against the Pricks, an all-covers album, broke the band in England with the help of ~The Singer,~ which hit number one on the U.K. independent charts. The album also strengthened Cave's reputation as an original interpreter and a vocal stylist of note.</p><p>Following 1986's Your Funeral...My Trial, Cave took a two-year hiatus from recording, partially to appear in Wim Wenders' 1987 film Wings of Desire, and then returned with Tender Prey, which featured Cramps guitarist Kid Congo Powers and Cave's strongest vocal performance up to that point. Cave's productivity picked up immensely over the next two years after he kicked a heroin habit. He had two books (1988's King Ink, a collection of lyrics, plays, and prose, and 1989's And the Ass Saw the Angel, a novel) published; appeared in the 1989 Australian film Ghosts...of the Civil Dead as a prisoner; recorded a soundtrack to the film with Harvey and Bargeld; and released 1990's The Good Son, his most relaxed, quiet album. Cave received his due as one of the leading figures in alternative rock when he was invited to perform on the 1994 edition of the Lollapalooza tour to promote his Let Love In album. Early in 1996, he released Murder Ballads, a collection of songs about murder. Murder Ballads became Cave's most commercially successful album to date, and, with typical perversity, he followed it with the introspective and personal The Boatman's Call in early 1997. A spoken word release, Secret Life of the Love Song, followed in 1999. Two years later, a rejuvenated Cave teamed up with the Bad Seeds once again for the piano-laden No More Shall We Part. Nocturama was released in 2003, and the double-album Abbatoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus followed by the end of 2004.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine & Steve Huey</b> ",

				"review": "<p>It is truly sad when artists with great vision and imagination, whose work is filled with power and beauty, just kind of lose it all at once. This could be the first record Nick Cave has made that feels like he is just doing it because it is his job to make records and be Nick Cave. Everything is predictable and sounds like something Cave has done before. The Bad Seeds' edges are smoothed over by the too-slick production; Cave's lyrics are not provocative or funny or much of anything worth hearing. ~He Wants You~ is a smooth and tired-sounding love song, ~Still in Love~ is a gothic love song with cheesy lyrics and some sickly singing, and ~Wonderful Life~ has a nice, slinky beat and a memorable melody that is ruined by generic lyrics. There are also a few surprises of an unpleasant nature on Nocturama: ~Bring It On~ sounds like alternative rock by-the-numbers; without Cave's vocals it could be the Wallflowers.</p> <p>This could be the first Bad Seeds track to sport a depressingly standard guitar solo over the fade. Longtime Cave fans may need to reach for the smelling salts after hearing it. There are also a couple of songs that revisit the old storm-and-bang days of the Birthday Party and early Bad Seeds. One might say these forays into noisy, aggressive post-punk are commendable or one could say he is treading water he puked out 20 years ago. Add to that the fact that the racing tempos, jagged guitars, and shouted vocals of ~Dead Man in My Bed~ and the seemingly endless ~Babe, I'm on Fire~ break up the somnambulant mood of the rest of the record. Actually, while it may be derivative of his glorious past, ~Babe, I'm on Fire~ is a welcome blast of energy; he should have made it 30 minutes long instead of ten and called it his new record. Apart from that track, Cave sounds like a writer on his 15th book with nothing much left to say, nothing left to do but go through the motions, phoning his performance in with a yawn. His fans should send him a message by leaving Nocturama (his worst record title ever) to gather dust on record store and warehouse shelves. His laziness and weak effort should not be rewarded with your hard-earned cash.</p>&mdash; <b>Tim Sendra</b>"

		"firstname": "Ray",
		"lastname": "Charles",
		"name": "Ray Charles",
		"biography": "<p>Ray Charles was the musician most responsible for developing soul music. Singers like Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson also did a great deal to pioneer the form, but Charles did even more to devise a new form of black pop by merging '50s R&B with gospel-powered vocals, adding plenty of flavor from contemporary jazz, blues, and (in the '60s) country. Then there was his singing; his style was among the most emotional and easily identifiable of any 20th-century performer, up there with the likes of Elvis and Billie Holiday. He was also a superb keyboard player, arranger, and bandleader. The brilliance of his 1950s and '60s work, however, can't obscure the fact that he made few classic tracks after the mid-'60s, though he recorded often and performed until the year before his death.</p><p>Blind since the age of six (from glaucoma), Charles studied composition and learned many instruments at the St. Augustine School for the Deaf and the Blind. His parents had died by his early teens, and he worked as a musician in Florida for a while before using his savings to move to Seattle in 1947. By the late '40s, he was recording in a smooth pop/R&B style derivative of Nat ~King~ Cole and Charles Brown. He got his first Top Ten R&B hit with ~Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand~ in 1951. Charles' first recordings came in for their fair share of criticism, as they were much milder and less original than the classics that would follow, although they're actually fairly enjoyable, showing strong hints of the skills that were to flower in a few years.</p><p>In the early '50s, Charles' sound started to toughen as he toured with Lowell Fulson, went to New Orleans to work with Guitar Slim (playing piano on and arranging Slim's huge R&B hit, ~The Things That I Used to Do~), and got a band together for R&B star Ruth Brown. It was at Atlantic Records that Ray Charles truly found his voice, consolidating the gains of recent years and then some with ~I Got a Woman,~ a number-two R&B hit in 1955. This is the song most frequently singled out as his pivotal performance, on which Charles first truly let go with his unmistakable gospel-ish moan, backed by a tight, bouncy horn-driven arrangement.</p><p>Throughout the '50s, Charles ran off a series of R&B hits that, although they weren't called ~soul~ at the time, did a lot to pave the way for soul by presenting a form of R&B that was sophisticated without sacrificing any emotional grit. ~This Little Girl of Mine,~ ~Drown in My Own Tears,~ ~Hallelujah I Love Her So,~ ~Lonely Avenue,~ and ~The Right Time~ were all big hits. But Charles didn't really capture the pop audience until ~What'd I Say,~ which caught the fervor of the church with its pleading vocals, as well as the spirit of rock & roll with its classic electric piano line. It was his first Top Ten pop hit, and one of his final Atlantic singles, as he left the label at the end of the '50s for ABC.</p><p>One of the chief attractions of the ABC deal for Charles was a much greater degree of artistic control of his recordings. He put it to good use on early-'60s hits like ~Unchain My Heart~ and ~Hit the Road Jack,~ which solidified his pop stardom with only a modicum of polish attached to the R&B he had perfected at Atlantic. In 1962, he surprised the pop world by turning his attention to country & western music, topping the charts with the ~I Can't Stop Loving You~ single, and making a hugely popular album (in an era in which R&B/soul LPs rarely scored high on the charts) with Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music. Perhaps it shouldn't have been so surprising; Charles had always been eclectic, recording quite a bit of straight jazz at Atlantic, with noted jazz musicians like David ~Fathead~ Newman and Milt Jackson.</p><p>Charles remained extremely popular through the mid-'60s, scoring big hits like ~Busted,~ ~You Are My Sunshine,~ ~Take These Chains From My Heart,~ and ~Crying Time,~ although his momentum was slowed by a 1965 bust for heroin. This led to a year-long absence from performing, but he picked up where he left off with ~Let's Go Get Stoned~ in 1966. Yet by this time Charles was focusing increasingly less on rock and soul, in favor of pop tunes, often with string arrangements, that seemed aimed more at the easy listening audience than anyone else. Charles' influence on the rock mainstream was as apparent as ever; Joe Cocker and Steve Winwood in particular owe a great deal of their style to him, and echoes of his phrasing can be heard more subtly in the work of greats like Van Morrison.</p><p>One approaches sweeping criticism of Charles with hesitation; he was an American institution, after all, and his vocal powers barely diminished over his half-century career. The fact remains, though, that his work after the late '60s on record was very disappointing. Millions of listeners yearned for a return to the all-out soul of his 1955-1965 classics, but Charles had actually never been committed to soul above all else. Like Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley, his focus was more upon all-around pop than many realize; his love of jazz, country, and pop standards was evident, even if his more earthy offerings were the ones that truly broke ground and will stand the test of time. He dented the charts (sometimes the country ones) occasionally, and commanded devoted international concert audiences whenever he felt like it. For good or ill, he ensured his imprint upon the American mass consciousness in the 1990s by singing several ads for Diet Pepsi. He also recorded three albums during the '90s for Warner Bros., but remained most popular as a concert draw. In 2002, he released Thanks for Bringing Love Around Again on his own Crossover imprint, and the following year began recording an album of duets featuring B.B. King, Willie Nelson, Michael McDonald, and James Taylor. After hip replacement surgery in 2003, he scheduled a tour for the following summer, but was forced to cancel an appearance in March 2004. Three months later, on June 10, 2004, Ray Charles succumbed to liver disease at his home in Beverly Hills, CA.</p>&mdash; by <b>Richie Unterberger</b>",

Fine moments abound--you can hear his delight even in the rather stiff company of Diana Krall and Natalie Cole. His voice sounds a bit frayed by ill health at times, but it also allows for great performances (the slyness behind the ache in his version of the old soul hit ~Hey Girl~ with Michael McDonald; a grand ~Crazy Love~ with Van Morrison). Potently, he and Gladys Knight also remind us of the continued timeliness of Stevie Wonder's ~Heaven Help Us All.~ Its best moments make Company one more essential purchase for Ray Charles fans.</p>&mdash; Rickey Wright"

There were plenty of flashy players, but nothing along the lines of Clapton, who rocketed to fame in the 1960s as the guitarist for the Yardbirds, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, and Cream. Clapton eased into a solo career in 1970, but he was so reticent to step to the front of the stage he adopted the pseudonym Derek & the Dominos for the album, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. By the end of the '70s, he had finally embraced his role as the preeminent guitarist of his generation, and also tempered his virtuosity with pretty ballads. That sensitive side shone on his biggest hit, 1992's MTV Unplugged, which also reconnected him with the blues roots upon which his entire career lay.</p><p>By the time Eric Clapton launched his solo career with the release of his self-titled debut album in mid-1970, he was long established as one of the world's major rock stars due to his group affiliations -- the Yardbirds, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Cream, Blind Faith -- all of which had demonstrated his claim to being the best rock guitarist of his generation. The fact that it took Clapton so long to go out on his own, however, was evidence of a degree of reticence unusual for someone of his stature. And his debut album, though it spawned the Top 40 hit ~After Midnight,~ was typical of his self-effacing approach: it was, in effect, an album by the group he had lately been featured in, Delaney & Bonnie & Friends.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/ec-rainbow.jpg~ alt=~Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert~><p>Not surprisingly, before his solo debut had even been released, Clapton had retreated from his solo stance, assembling from the D&B&F ranks the personnel for a group, Derek & the Dominos, with whom he played for most of 1970 and recorded the landmark album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. Clapton was largely inactive in 1971 and 1972, due to heroin addiction, but he performed a comeback concert at the Rainbow Theatre in London on January 13, 1973, resulting in the album Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert (September 1973). But Clapton did not launch a sustained solo career until July 1974, when he released 461 Ocean Boulevard, which topped the charts and spawned the number one single ~I Shot the Sheriff.~</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/ec-one-in-every-crowd.jpg~ alt=~There's One in Every Crowd~><p>The persona Clapton established over the next decade was less that of guitar hero than arena rock star with a weakness for ballads. The follow-ups to 461 Ocean Boulevard, There's One in Every Crowd (March 1975), the live E.C. Was Here (August 1975), and No Reason to Cry (August 1976), were less successful. But Slowhand (November 1977), which featured both the powerful ~Cocaine~ (written by J.J. Cale, who had also written ~After Midnight~) and the hit singles ~Lay Down Sally~ and ~Wonderful Tonight,~ was a million-seller. Its follow-ups, Backless (November 1978), featuring the Top Ten hit ~Promises,~ the live Just One Night (April 1980), and Another Ticket (February 1981), featuring the Top Ten hit ~I Can't Stand It,~ were all big sellers.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/ec-money.jpg~ alt=~Money and Cigarettes~><p>Clapton's popularity waned somewhat in the first half of the '80s, as the albums Money and Cigarettes (February 1983), Behind the Sun (March 1985), and August (November 1986) indicated a certain career stasis. But he was buoyed up by the release of the box set retrospective Crossroads (April 1988), which seemed to remind his fans of how great he was. Journeyman (November 1989) was a return to form. It would be his last new studio album for nearly five years, though in the interim he would suffer greatly and enjoy surprising triumph. On March 20, 1991, Clapton's four-year-old son was killed in a fall. While he mourned, he released a live album, 24 Nights (October 1991), culled from his annual concert series at Royal Albert Hall in London, and prepared a movie soundtrack, Rush (January 1992). The soundtrack featured a song written for his son, ~Tears in Heaven,~ that became a massive hit single.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/ec-from-the-cradle.jpg~ alt=~From the Cradle~><p>In March 1992, Clapton recorded a concert for MTV Unplugged which, when released on an album in August, became his biggest-selling record ever. Two years later, Clapton returned with a blues album, From the Cradle, which became one of his most successful albums, both commercially and critically. Crossroads, Vol. 2: Live in the Seventies, a box set chronicling his live work from the '70s, was released to mixed reviews. In early 1997, Clapton, billing himself by the pseudonym ~X-Sample,~ collaborated with keyboardist/producer Simon Climie as the ambient new age and trip-hop duo T.D.F. The duo released Retail Therapy to mixed reviews in early 1997.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/ec-pilgrim.jpg~ alt=~Pilgrim~><p>Clapton retained Climie as his collaborator for Pilgrim, his first album of new material since 1989's Journeyman. Pilgrim was greeted with decidedly mixed reviews upon its spring 1998 release, but the album debuted at number four and stayed in the Top Ten for several weeks on the success of the single ~My Father's Eyes.~ In 2000, Clapton teamed up with old friend B.B. King on Riding with the King, a set of blues standards and material from contemporary singer/songwriters. Another solo outing, entitled Reptile, followed in early 2001. Three years later, Clapton issued Me and Mr. Johnson, a collection of tunes honoring the Mississippi-born bluesman Robert Johnson. Released in 2005, Back Home, Clapton's 14th album of original material, reflected his ease with fatherhood. Also in 2005, Clapton unexpectedly teamed with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker for a Cream reunion that included May concerts at London's Royal Albert Hall and shows at New York's Madison Square Garden in October, with the former being compiled for a live release that fall.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/ec-the-road-to-escondido.jpg~ alt=~The Road to Escondido~><p>This turned out to be the first of many reunions and looks back for Clapton. In 2006, he elevated the profile of his latter-day idol J.J. Cale by recording an album-long duet, The Road to Escondido. The following year he released his autobiography -- accompanied by a new career compilation called The Complete Clapton -- which focused more on his trials with addiction and subsequent recovery than his musical career. In 2008, Clapton began playing regular shows with his old Blind Faith partner Steve Winwood, gigs that were captured on the 2009 double-live set Live from Madison Square Garden. Winwood also appeared on Clapton's next studio album, 2010's Clapton, which was a collaboration-heavy affair also featuring Cale, Sheryl Crow, Allen Toussaint, and Wynton Marsalis. In 2011, Clapton returned the favor to Marsalis by collaborating on the live concert album Play the Blues: Live from Jazz at Lincoln Center.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/ec-old-sock.jpg~ alt=~Old Sock~><p>Clapton parted ways with Warner after Clapton, and he chose to set up his own Bushbranch imprint on independent label Surfdog. His first album for the label was Old Sock, largely a collection of old songs the guitarist loved. It reached the Top Ten in the U.S. and Great Britain. In the fall of 2013, Warner Bros. released Crossroads Guitar Festival 2013, and his Unplugged album was expanded and remastered by Rhino. Early the following year, Clapton announced that a new album, The Breeze: An Appreciation of J.J. Cale, would be issued in July, one year on from the passing of his key inspiration. The tribute album included contributions from artists such as Willie Nelson, John Mayer, Tom Petty, and Mark Knopfler. A collection of his Warner recordings called Forever Man saw a spring 2015 release. Clapton returned in May of 2016 with I Still Do, his third album for Surfdog. It found him reuniting with Slowhand producer Glyn Johns; the album debuted at six on the Billboard Top 200. Later that year, Clapton released Live in San Diego, a double-disc album featuring a 2007 concert with J.J. Cale. In 2018, Clapton released his first holiday album, Happy Xmas.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>",

Maybe it was that the once reclusive Clapton was now spitting out new albums every six months, but E.C. Was Here did not achieve the renown it deserved upon release, and Clapton, who had been reluctant to put out a straight blues album to begin with, didn't try anything similar again for almost 20 years, instead making sure to keep his records within a pop framework that usually diluted their effectiveness. In its CD reissue, with ~Drifting Blues~ extended out to its full 11 1 / 2 minutes, the album is even more impressive. </p><br><br>- - William Ruhlmann<br>"

Clapton did earn a Top Ten hit with Richard Feldman and Roger Linn's understated pop shuffle ~Promises,~ but it was not one of his more memorable recordings. Of course, Clapton's blues playing on the lone obligatory blues cut, ~Early in the Morning~ (presented in its full eight - minute version on the CD reissue), was stellar.

Spanning four discs and consisting almost entirely of live material (there are a handful of studio outtakes), this is music that will only enthrall completists and archivists. For those listeners, there is a wealth of fascinating, compelling performances here, as well as a fair share of mediocre, uninspired tracks.</p><p>The key word for the entire album is detail - - it is an album for studying the intricacies of Clapton's playing and how it evolved. For example, it's easy to hear the differences and progressions between the four versions of Robert Johnson's ~Rambling On My Mind.~ And it is Clapton that evolves, not his supporting band - - although they are proficient, they are hardly exciting. However, they're static, professional support provides a nice bed to chart Slowhand's growth over the course of the decade, simply because he is always the focal point. Crossroads 2 may only be for a collector, but for those collectors, it is a treasure, even if some of the tracks are fool's gold.</p><br><br>- - Stephen Thomas Erlewine<br>"

Best of all, Clapton had taken the time to write some songs - - he's credited on six of the nine selections - - and tunes such as the title track and ~I Can't Stand It~ held up well.

When he sings, Clapton loses that sense of originality, choosing to mimic the vocals of the original recordings. At times, his overemotive singing is painful; he doesn't have the strength to pull off Howlin' Wolf's growl or the confidence to replicate Muddy Waters' assured phrasing. Yet, whenever he plays, it's easier to forget his vocal shortcomings.

				"review": "<p>Not to be confused with the 1980s vintage concert video Eric Clapton & Friends, Live in Hyde Park is a first-rate showcase for the guitar legend's playing, offering him ample room to work out on acoustic as well as electric guitar and a fine display of his oft-overlooked vocal skills. Opening up with an acoustic rendition of ~Layla,~ the performance starts off on a subtle note before plunging into the higher-wattage straits of ~Badge~ and other songs — working alongside Clapton are Dave Bronze on bass, Andy Fairweather-Low on guitar, Chris Stainton on keyboards, Steve Gadd on drums, Jerry Portnoy on harmonica, Roddy Lorimer, Simon Clarke, and Tim Sanders on horns, plus a girl vocal duo and a gospel choir singing backup. Interestingly, in addition to the expected numbers associated directly with Clapton and his idols — including ~Hoochie Coochie Man,~ ~I Shot the Sheriff,~ ~Five Long Years,~ and ~Have You Ever Loved a Woman~ — he also performs ~White Room,~ a number written by and much more closely associated with (and, indeed, still in the repertory of) Jack Bruce. The latter is transformed into something much more lyrical and upbeat than the Cream original. The sound, which offers a selection of stereo, DTS, and 5.1 Surround, is impeccable, and the full-screen (1.33-to-1) image is even better, with lively, mobile camera work, and coupled with the fact that the 89-minute program captured Clapton on what looks like an especially ~on~ gig, this is a purchase that any fan, dedicated or casual, can make with confidence. The disc opens automatically on an easy-to-use menu with the ~play~ option in the default position.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Bruce Eder</b></p>"

				"review": "<p>It appears that Eric Clapton had more Robert Johnson in his blood than he thought -- or perhaps it was planned this way. This DVD/CD set (and really, it's not the other way around despite the packaging), showcases Clapton mining the Robert Johnson vein ever more deeply in no less than four different settings. The DVD features 19 acoustic and electric performances recorded in rehearsal spaces in Dallas and in England, as well as in the 508 Park Ave. in Dallas, a studio Johnson himself recorded in, in 1937. There is one more segment, a recorded solo acoustic in a hotel room in California. The band that joins Clapton in the rehearsal studios is comprised of guitar master Doyle Bramhall, organist Billy Preston, Steve Gadd on drums, pianist Chris Stainton and Nathan East on bass. The electric performances, particularly ~Milkcow's Calf 's Blues,~ ~Stop Breakin' Down Blues,~ and especially ~I Wish I Had Possession Over Judgment Day,~ have some real life and stomp in them. Of the acoustic tracks, ~Terraplane Blues~ works best. The DVD also contains a selection of behind-the-scenes footage that will be of interest only to those fans who need to see everything. The CD contains 11 cuts culled from the DVD and the sequencing is in some ways preferable.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

				"review": "<p>Live from Madison Square Garden, the double live album (and DVDs) compiled from Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood’s reunion concerts, was released on May 19th, 2009. Until the concerts, which took place at New York City’s historic venue from February 25th to the 28th of 2008, the two rocks legends and longtime friends had yet to perform a full concert together for nearly 40 years. Clapton and Winwood had first worked together in the 1966 blink-and-you-missed it supergroup Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse. The two would join forces yet again for another supergroup in 1969, the acclaimed Blind Faith. Unfortunately, due to a number of issues, the group dissolved within a year of its creation and Blind Faith’s final performance took place in Hawaii on August 24th of 1969. The idea for a reunion concert would arise from the 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival where Clapton and Winwood took the stage together to perform a small number of songs.</p><p>Live from Madison Square Garden compiled the cream of the performances taken from those the concerts to showcase this historic reunion of rock and roll royalty. With the help of Chris Stainton on keyboards, Ian Thomas on drums, and Willie Weeks on bass, Winwood and Clapton beautifully performed songs from each other’s lengthy musical careers in addition to a number of classic blues and rock covers. As expected, a healthy dose of Blind Faith’s one and only album graced both the stage and recorded releases, with “Had To Cry Today”, “Presence of the Lord”, and “Can’t Find My Way Home” shinning the brightest. A number of songs from Winwood’s breakthrough group, Traffic, such as “Dear Mr. Fantasy”, “Glad”, and “Pearly Queen”, made appearances. Clapton brought with him his chart-topping “Forever Man” as well as his beloved renditions of J.J. Cales’ “After Midnight” and “Cocaine”. The music of Jimi Hendrix was also celebrated as “Little Wing”, the Band of Gypsys piece “Them Changes”, and, the quintessential example of psychedelic blues, “Voodoo Chile” were all brilliantly brought to life. Months before the live album was even released, Clapton and Winwood announced a 14 date tour of the United States that would kick off on June 10th, 2009, and would follow that tour with others in the following years. Live from Madison Square Garden went on to be quite the success and is truly a treat for a fan of either Clapton or Winwood. Hands down, it should not be missed!</p>"

		"biography": "<P>Australian singer/songwriter Richard Clapton played with several bands during the late '60s and '70s as he traveled across Europe before returning to Australia in 1972 to begin his solo career.</p><P>His debut single, ~Last Train to Marseilles,~ released in October 1972, was not commercially successful and he joined the jazz-rock band Sun for a six-week stint. His debut album, Prussian Blue, was released in November 1973, but his first chart success was with the single ~Girls on the Avenue,~ which reached number two nationally in March 1975. He released the Girls on the Avenue album followed by the album Main Street Jive in July 1976. A European tour followed at the end of the year. Clapton's contribution to the 1977 Highway One soundtrack album, ~Capricorn Dancer,~ peaked at number 20.</p><P>Clapton's third album, Goodbye Tiger, was released in August 1977 and is considered one of his finest works. It peaked at number five nationally during November. The next year was spent touring and recording in Los Angeles. Two tracks from the American sessions, ~Steppin' Across the Line~ and ~When the Heat's Off,~ appeared on the compilation album Past Hits and Previews, released in November 1978. Clapton's American-recorded album Hearts on the Nightline peaked at number 17 and kicked off a national tour. Dark Spaces was released in 1980 and was dedicated to his rhythm guitarist, Andrew Durant, who died in June. Clapton sang three tracks on the Andrew Durant Memorial Concert album of 1981.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/rc-the-great-escape.jpg~ alt=~The Great Escape~><P>A new record deal with WEA in 1982 produced The Great Escape, which peaked at number seven in March. The single, ~I Am an Island,~ peaked at number 20 while the compilation album, The Very Best of Richard Clapton, peaked at number 15 during the same time. Another national tour followed which included bassist Garry Gary Beers and drummer Jon Farriss from INXS as part of his backing band; an association that began when Clapton produced their 1981 album, Underneath the Colours. In 1983, Clapton joined the Party Boys for a short time and appeared on their Greatest Hits (of Other People) album. In 1984, Clapton released his next solo album, Solidarity, and again toured the country. Glory Road followed in 1987, produced by Jon Farriss in return for Clapton's work on Underneath the Colours.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/rc-best-years-of-our-lives.jpg~ alt=~The Best Years Of Our Lives~><P>In September 1989, The Best Years of Our Lives, a live album recorded on April 16, 1989, was issued. The next four years were spent undergoing contractual difficulties until Clapton signed a five-album deal with Sony. Between record deals, Clapton remained popular on the touring circuit and went on to release Distant Thunder in 1993 and Angeltown in 1996.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Brendan Swift</strong></p>",

An artist can improvise in the studio, certainly, but in concert a musician can ignore time limits and stretch creative possibilities. This is especially true of all-star collaborations; they can seem contrived or forced, but when chemistry exists between the players, the result is jazz in its purest, most exciting form. Such is the case on this disc, which features five contemporary giants: Clarke, Larry Carlton, Najee, Deron Johnson, and Billy Cobham. Seventy minutes for seven songs allows the players to interact and solo at length, stretching originals and Miles and Mingus covers to their limit. While each member is a monster improvisor, all base their musings on a definite wave of melodic brilliance. Najee is the real surprise here, as Clarke says in his liner notes. While the others are respected as top fusion cats, the saxman has always faced criticism for the commercialism of his albums; here, Najee proves he can blow with the best of them, getting the energy flowing on tracks like his own ~Buenos Aires.~ Other highlights include the light intro ~Minute By Minute,~ which L.C. popularized as an instrumental; Cobham's explosive ~Stratus~; Carlton's simmering ~Her Favorite Song~; and the final piece, an increasingly frenetic, 22-minute explosion of Clarke's classic ~School Days.~</p>&mdash; <b>Jonathan Widran</b>"

		"biography": "<p>Immensely popular in his native Canada, singer/songwriter Bruce Cockburn has found only cult success south of the border, in spite of a rich, varied body of work and considerable critical nods. He has won numerous Juno Awards and has kept the quality control on most of his albums at a high level.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/bc-dancing.jpg~ alt=~Dancing In The Dragon's Jaw~><p>Cockburn's first decade of work (1970-1979) is largely literate, singer/songwriter folk-rock, often with a strong Christian tone and mystical, devotional lyrics. In 1979, Cockburn had his only major U.S. single, ~Wondering Where the Lions Are,~ which peaked at number 21. The accompanying album, Dancing in the Dragon's Jaw, saw him augmenting his music with worldbeat rhythms, an approach he would continue over his next few albums. Cockburn toned down his Christian viewpoint for much of the '80s, partially as a way of disconnecting himself from the American religious right, which he found antithetical to his own spiritual beliefs, and partially to concentrate on more humanitarian, political subject matter. In 1984, Cockburn produced an AOR hit, ~If I Had a Rocket Launcher,~ whose accompanying video depicted conditions in war-torn Central America and gained a fair amount of MTV play.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/bc-never-seen.jpg~ alt=~You've Never Seen Everything~><p>Cockburn's later '80s work took on a more streamlined rock sound, and his political agenda was weighted toward environmental concerns, as well as oppression. In the '90s, he returned to the more introspective feel recalling his earlier work, and moved toward a more global and political perspective with issues of the angry and polemical for You've Never Seen Everything in 2003. 2005's Speechless was an all-instrumental affair, showing off the artist's skill on guitar, while the next year's Life Short Call Now showed an artist at the prime of his musical maturity. A live set, Slice o Life: Bruce Cockburn Live Solo, arrived in 2009. After a brief tour, Cockburn returned to the studio in 2010, where he finished work on a new collection entitled Small Source of Comfort, which was released in early 2011; it is an intimate set of songs and guitar-based instrumentals (including the live but never recorded Cockburn standard ~The Gift~). The album was produced by Colin Linden and features violinist Jenny Scheinman. After the birth of his daughter Iona that year, Cockburn faded into the backdrop to focus on family and writing his autobiography. He also assembled the 11-disc career-spanning box set, Rumours of Glory, which was issued in 2014. His memoir of the same title was published in 2016. Inspired by a book of poems by 20th century Canadian poet Al Purdy, Cockburn set to work writing new material and entered a California studio with Linden as producer/guitarist, his road band, and guests including cornetist Ron Miles and Mary Gauthier. The finished album, Bone on Bone (his 33rd) was issued by True North on September 15, 2017, a week before Cockburn was inducted -- along with Neil Young, Beau Dommage, and Stéphane Venne, into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Steve Huey</strong></p>",

And since this was 1970, the album also comes equipped with some of those quaint excesses of the period; try the nasal tone poem gracing ~The Bicycle Trip.~ ~Musical Friends~ remains a lively, happy-go-lucky classic with piano signature lifted from Paul McCartney's playbook; it's difficult to picture the dour Cockburn of more recent years ever having this much fun. In contrast, ~Thoughts on a Rainy Afternoon~ offers a trance-like, introspective atmosphere reminiscent of British folkie legend Nick Drake.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Roch Parisien</strong></p>"

There's the ragtime blues of ~Happy Good Morning Blues,~ the ambitious minor-key troubadour folk of ~Love Song,~ and the slide guitar country of ~One Day I Walk~ to kick things off. And over the album's original ten songs it just becomes more ambitious. ~Golden Serpent Blues,~ with its poignant and percussive piano lines, is something out of a Western Canadian barrelhouse where the piano player has heard and loved ~Lady Madonna.~ Overall, however, this album -- like Sunwheel Dance that follows it -- presents a far more mystical Cockburn.

				"review": "<p>Released shortly after the transitional In the Falling Dark, Circles in the Stream seemed to serve as the final chapter in Bruce Cockburn's promising yet inconsistent early career. Recorded live in Toronto, the record brings together some of Cockburn's best songs from this period, including the beautiful meditation ~All the Diamonds in the World,~ the bluesy ~Mama Just Wants to Barrelhouse All Night Long,~ and ~Lord of the Starfields~ from his previous release. And while there isn't anything drastically different here, many of the tracks are more assured and fully realized than their studio counterparts, with Cockburn's guitar and voice front and center -- solo or backed by subtle bass, percussion, and piano or marimba. There are also a scattering of new tunes that mix nicely with the older material, with the Native American tribute ~Red Brother, Red Sister~ and the instrumental ~Deer Dancing Round a Broken Mirror~ the true standouts. Strong performances and a good selection of songs help Circles in the Stream succeed not only as a good live album, but also as a decent retrospective of Cockburn's first seven years.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Long regarded as Bruce Cockburn's finest moment on record, Humans, issued in 1980, is easily the most revealing of his tomes as well. This Rounder reissue is fully remastered and contains one bonus track, a live reading of the album's opener, ~Grim Travellers.~ Cockburn's marriage had fallen apart, he'd moved from the country to a gritty inner-city section of Toronto called Cabbagetown, and he'd begun to explore in earnest the reggae rhythms that had underscored his hit single ~Wondering Where the Lions Are~ from Dancing in the Dragon's Jaws. The record of a restless travelogue that has become his stock in trade as a wandering observer, activist, and minstrel with deep wanderlust, Humans is the result of great turmoil and pain, and reveals Cockburn's musical, spiritual, and emotional worldview as all in flux. The record opens with the hard truth of global mercenaries in ~Grim Travellers,~ a shimmering beauty of a song with a dubby bassline and jazzed-out Fender Rhodes piano. This is Cockburn's first issued song in his documentary style, complete with rich metaphorical images of horror and truth and the beauty on their nether sides. ~Rumours of Glory~ is straight-up reggae. It grooves and rocks steady, with a bubbling bassline punching up the front line. Lyrically the song offers a new kind of mystical attraction for Cockburn, one rooted in the crust of everyday life: ~You see the extremes of what humans can be/In that distance/Some tensions are born/Energy surging, like a storm/You plunge your hand in/You draw it back, scorched/Beneath, it's shining like gold/But better....~ A beautiful backing chorus that sounds like the I-Threes croons the tune to a close.</p><p>There is real darkness and anguish here, too. On ~You Get Bigger as You Go,~ a relationship separates as the world comes apart in front of the protagonist's eyes as he looks out the window; acoustic guitars, violins, and tom-toms usher in the tough truth of a new day. The album's best travel song, ~How I Spent My Fall Vacation,~ talks about the tensions of traveling in a beautiful but dangerous world; it's followed by ~Tokyo,~ a darkly ironic account of a terrible accident witnessed by the protagonist while visiting. The album closes with a low-key manifesto in ~The Rose Above the Sky.~ It's an affirmation of faith in the darkness, of waiting for God in the heart of loss and uncertainty. Graced by acoustic guitars fingerpicked softly and painted by keyboard washes, it grows in tension and texture, becoming an anthem by its end. Humans is universal in its confusion and hard-won willingness to endure without seeking creature comforts or easy answers. Its musical and lyrical adventure would be a watermark for any artist; for Cockburn it became the first step to musical and poetic freedom. It sounds as harrowing, beautiful, and ethereal 20-plus years later as it did when it was first issued, and offers a uniquely universal message for seekers of personal, social, and spiritual truth. This is the one to start with. It is also the one to end with.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

Furthermore, like that record, there's an uneasiness that runs throughout, from the jazz-tinged opener, ~You Pay Your Money and You Take Your Chance,~ to the disquieting ~Loner,~ which closes the album. Even a love song like ~Wanna Go Walking,~ one of the most straightforward rockers he's ever recorded, reflects the weight of the outside world. Only the jazzy instrumental ~Radio Shoes~ and the joyful ~And We Dance~ remain free of this underlying tension. Musically, moody synths, violin, and woodwinds on Inner City Front underscore the dark, reflective nature of the material, which like its predecessor, deals with the ~paradox and contrast~ in the human condition, from personal relationships to world affairs. Also, for the second consecutive recording, Cockburn eschews the folkier, acoustic leanings of his '70s work and places both feet squarely into the jazz and worldbeat rock that dominated the majority of Humans. One track, ~The Strong One,~ is even given a slow, brooding, techno treatment. Since the release of In the Falling Dark, Cockburn was gaining creative momentum with each release, and Inner City Front continues that trend.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

And while he had touched on similar musical themes on earlier recordings, the eclectic blend of folk, rock, and world music here is much more defined and realized. The use of synths, electric guitar, violin, and Chapman Stick, along with the occasional keyboard and drum sequences, complement the weighty, ominous nature of his lyrical concerns, which seem to paint a picture of a world, though teetering on the edge, still filled with beauty (~Hoop Dancer~), hope (~Put Our Hearts Together~), and contentment (~Waiting for the Moon to Show~). Amidst the ~chaos~ and ~fashionable fascism,~ Cockburn's message, though cloaked in frustration and cynicism, and not nearly as overt as it has been in the past, is still one of faith and love. There is the tendency to get heavy-handed at times, but still, The Trouble With Normal contains some of Cockburn's most beautifully imagistic writing to date and is another strong effort. The U.S. release contains an alternate, yet inferior take of the title track, which makes the Canadian (True North) version preferable.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>After visiting Central America, Bruce Cockburn recorded Stealing Fire, part of which passionately and eloquently details what he'd seen while in Nicaragua and Guatemala. With the opening track, the terse rocker ~Lovers in a Dangerous Time,~ Cockburn conveys both a sense of urgency and uncertainty. There's a brief calm as the second half begins, before a triad of songs written about his time spent in Central America brings the record to a sober conclusion. These three tunes, which, like the majority of the album, sport a tight, worldbeat, folk and rock flavor, are the true highlights of Stealing Fire, and Cockburn at his very best. The first, ~Nicaragua,~ is part observation, part commentary, and part tribute to the Sandinista-led revolution in that country. ~If I Had a Rocket Launcher~ follows, and is arguably Cockburn's most powerful merging of personal and political feelings. Written after witnessing Guatemalan refugees being chased across the border by gun-wielding helicopters, ~Rocket Launcher~ evokes not only the pain and suffering of the people, but the conflict between Cockburn's pacifist leanings, and the vengeful anger and hatred incited by such a horrific sight. The Nicaraguan, road-inspired ~Dust and Diesel~ closes the record with a portrait of a country whose daily contrast of beauty and violence is summed up by the images of people who are proud, hopeful, passionate, afraid, and tired. Stealing Fire, despite a few less than compelling tracks, is the work of an artist at his peak. It also contains some of the most intensely significant material by a singer/songwriter in the 1980s.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

It was a move away from the somewhat dated, overblown sound of his previous World of Wonders, toward a leaner, more guitar-dominated sound. Budgeting for album art seemed to be a little low, but luckily the collection of songs was of consistent high quality. As with most Cockburn albums, this is a mix of socially conscious, spiritual, and reflective songs. Cockburn had spent time in Nepal in 1987 and what he saw there found its way into some songs, including ~Tibetan Side of Town~ and ~Understanding Nothing.~ Time spent in Germany soon after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union inspired ~Radium Rain,~ while deforestation of the globe inspired ~If a Tree Falls,~ the first single from the album. Cockburn is equally at home writing about matters of the heart, though his lyrics take a much more unconventional turn in ~Don't Feel Your Touch,~ with lines such as ~the night grows sharp and hollow as a junkie's craving vein~ and ~the night grows clear and empty as a lake of acid rain.~ Elsewhere on the album, in ~Gospel of Bondage~ he takes pains to differentiate himself from right-wing Christianity and express his different view of the faith. Unusually for Cockburn, he ends the album on a slightly humorous (albeit dark humor) note with ~Anything Can Happen,~ a look at the temporariness of life, where ~anything can happen~ at any time ~to put out the light.~</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Rob Caldwell</strong></p>"

Fronting a tight three-piece unit, which sounds bigger thanks to Fergus Marsh's stick, Michael Sloski's eloquent drumming, and his own fingerstyle guitar work, Cockburn delivers a nice overview of his career, dating back as far as the record's opener, ~Silver Wheels,~ from 1976. Amid his usual elements of spirituality and state-of-the-world messages, there's also a lightness and even a sense of humor that is rarely, if ever, seen in his studio work. His choice to close with ~Always Look on the Bright Side of Life~ from the crucifixion scene in Monty Python's Life of Brian is both funny and inspired, while ~Rumours of Glory,~ with its playful harmonica, gains a joyful bounce, and his lone Top 40 U.S. hit, ~Wondering Where the Lions Are,~ becomes a crowd-pleasing singalong. Elsewhere Cockburn gives a new look to old tunes, whether it's solo performances of ~After the Rain~ and ~Call It Democracy,~ the stark power of the bodhran, vocal rendition of ~Stolen Land,~ or the more palatable, jumping blues treatment of ~Maybe the Poet.~ Even though there are no songs, with the exception of ~Always Look on the Bright Side of Life,~ that are not available elsewhere, there's enough personality in these live versions to recommend the record on its own merit, and not just as a souvenir of a successful tour.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

Throughout, Burnett's production is understated, allowing Cockburn's voice, guitar, and songs to lead the way over a solid foundation of bass, drums, and tasteful organ by Booker T. Jones. This sort of sympathetic production brings out the best in Cockburn and his material, which is consistently strong. Songs such as ~Kit Carson,~ ~Mighty Trucks of Midnight,~ and ~Indian Wars~ continue the weightier concerns of his work of the past decade, but the majority of the record takes on a more personal, introspective tone. ~One of the Best Ones~ and ~Great Big Love~ are winning affirmations of love and life, while the retelling of the nativity, ~Cry of a Tiny Babe,~ is as beautiful and moving a contemporary Christmas song as you're likely to hear. Cockburn also decides to include a rare cover, his excellent reading of the Blind Willie Johnson gospel-blues ~Soul of a Man,~ which fits nicely in the whole of the album. Though it may lack the immediate power, Nothing but a Burning Light is Bruce Cockburn's best since his 1984 release Stealing Fire.

The opening track, ~Listen for the Laugh,~ a horn-driven rocker that wouldn't have been out of place on many of his recordings during the '80s, and the almost joyful finality of ~Tie Me at the Crossroads,~ bookend what is primarily more subdued material, including the tender second track, ~All the Ways I Want You,~ which more suitably sets the tone for the album. And though it may not possess the intensity or power of his early-'80s output, Dart to the Heart comes with nearly a quarter century of experience behind it, bringing an insight, depth, and maturity to Cockburn's ventures into love and the mystic. Still, there's just enough outrage and frustration to keep things interesting. Musically, T-Bone Burnett's sympathetic production tastefully and engagingly frames the songs, placing Cockburn's vocal and characteristically superb guitar at center stage. Those who may have found his overtly political, worldbeat and jazz-inflected rock a bit strident in the past should find his approach here more inviting. And while he may have revisited this familiar ground from time to time throughout his career, Dart to the Heart is a convincing reminder of a gentler, more reflective Bruce Cockburn.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>At once a departure and a return, The Charity of Night represents a change from the folk rock stylings of his previous two albums, having more in common with earlier jazz-inflected works such as Night Vision. Shades of light and shadow play through the album's theme of reflection and memory: Cockburn recalls many events of his past, taking stock and coming to grips with them. It's a very cohesive album in subject, with only the anti-land mine ~Mines of Mozambique~ seeming out of place (though it's a worthwhile song on its own). The centerpiece of the album is the title song, a realization that facing the past can be more difficult when memories are exposed in the cold hard light of day, but the refuge and peace darkness can provide is ~the charity of night.~ In fact, most of the album's events happen at night and this theme is echoed in the haunting booklet artwork by Bill Sienkiewicz, graphic novel illustrator for comics such as The Sandman. Musically the sound is very organic, with solid bass and drums provided by Rob Wasserman and Gary Craig. Guest Gary Burton provides shimmering vibraphone on three of the cuts, adding to the jazz texture. Other guests include Bonnie Raitt, Ani DiFranco, Jonatha Brooke, and Patty Larkin. The album culminates with ~Strange Waters,~ a summation of Cockburn's life-long spiritual search, where he asks the question ~if I loose my grip, will I take flight?~ Acclaimed by fans and critics alike, this album is an essential part of the Cockburn catalog.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Rob Caldwell</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Breakfast in New Orleans Dinner in Timbuktu is Bruce Cockburn's 20th studio album. Lyrically, Cockburn doesn't stray from the impressionist poetic lyrics that he's honed over the years, nor does he stray from his favored topics: travelogs, including those drawn from his trips to Third World nations that emphasize his social concerns; reflections on the dynamics of relationships between men and women; and a spiritual mysticism rooted in Christianity. Musically, too, there's a consistency to his folk-jazz-rock amalgam. The album features the vocal contributions of a rotating cast of three women who appear throughout the album. Jonell Mosser sings on two songs, including the single ~Last Night of the World.~ Margo Timmins of Cowboy Junkies lends her breathy pipes to two songs: the sultry ~Mango~ and a cover of the Fats Domino nugget ~Blueberry Hill~ that turns up the ~rock~ and de-emphasizes the ~roll.~ Most important, Lucinda Williams appears on four tracks. The standout track on the album is ~Isn't That What Friends Are For.~ This tender song of friendship is made more poignant by Williams' voice, which always manages to convey a deep sense of hurt. While the lyrics are sure to be enjoyed by those who are willing to listen and think, fans of Cockburn's guitar playing won't be disappointed, either.</p><p>There are two instrumental pieces, both band efforts, which feature Cockburn's acoustic guitar. ~Down to the Delta~ is an up-tempo tune, while ~Deep Lake~ is a quiet, more reflective piece that is close to the impressionistic style of Michael Hedges -- except, of course, that Cockburn has been playing this sort of thing since 1971's High Winds White Sky.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Martin Monkman</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>It feels weird to be writing that Bruce Cockburn has just issued his 27th album, but that's what You've Never Seen Everything is. It's been a quite a ride since 1970; the changes lyrically and musically have been enormous, and the world view of the artist — politically, spiritually, and psychologically — has evolved consciously and extensively. Of his many gifts, two of his most developed are his journalistic eye for detail, and having one ear always to the ground. This time out, the view is sharply contrasting from one song to the next. Politically, this is Cockburn's angriest record since World of Wonders or Stealing Fire. A listen to the hypnotic vibe of ~All Our Dark Tomorrows,~ with its spooky, Malian/Ali Farka Toure guitar vibe, points directly at the root of all human evil: greed. ~Trickle Down,~ an over-the-top jazz tune with Brazilian percussion and fine solos by Cockburn and pianist Andy Milne, reveals that by peeling away layer after layer, there are people who actually get paid to keep greed accumulating. But for Cockburn, righteous anger and indignant rage are never the whole picture. ~Put It in Your Heart~ is about the fierceness of love in the face of fear, both individual and collective, while ~Don't Forget About Delight,~ with its floating violin (Hugh Marsh) and harmonica (Gregoire Maret) lines entwining across the plaintive mix, is an exhortation to keep seeing the beauty with the inner eye despite the outward conditions and single-mindedness in this pursuit.</p><p>Sarah Harmer, Sam Phillips, Emmylou Harris, and Jackson Browne also help out on the vocal chores, and Cockburn borrowed Tom Waits' rhythm section of Larry Taylor and Stephen Hodges for balancing the wild musical ride this album is texturally and compositionally. The title track is among the most forward-thinking and sonically adventurous tracks he's ever recorded. Hand percussion and drum loops are interlaced with minimal piano and harmonica riffs shimmering on the fringes; the long, spoken (maybe even preachy) word travelog, full of horrific images and expressionistic electronica, gives way to a sung refrain that transcends the lyric but leaves the listener unsettled. ~Postcards From Cambodia~ is another one, full of detailed explications of conditions caused by other conditions that have come before, and on the refrain he concedes: ~This is too big for anger, too big for blame/We stumble through history, so humanly lame/So I bow down my head and say a prayer for us all/That we don't fear the spirit when it comes to call.~ Ultimately, this is the hinge track on the album, because Cockburn, despite the barely concealed fury that is contained within him, sees only a spiritual — and no, not necessarily ~Christian~ — solution to all of it, from the injustices to the anger and hatred he feels in his own heart for the perpetrators. Cockburn seems to be saying — and this is only this writer's interpretation of a very complex, wondrously intricate, and musically adventurous work — not to hate those whose actions cause suffering, but to root out the hatred in our own hearts so as not to become them. Action must come from compassion, not merely from anger, or it becomes nothing more than a mirror image of the cause of suffering itself. It is pointless to place this record in a pecking order with Cockburn's other work; that it adds to that body of work immeasurably is compliment enough. However, to say that it is necessary because it can cause self- and world-examination in any listener who plays it through is as high a compliment as can be offered.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

				"review": "<p>Bruce Cockburn displayed his aesthetic restlessness with his instrumental album Speechless in 2005. Those who have followed his career over the past four decades wondered where he would go next, or indeed if there was anywhere he could go. The question has been answered in spades on Life Short Call Now. Along with his regular band, Cockburn has employed an orchestral 27-piece string section to expressionistically color a good number of these 12 songs with help from producer Jon Goldsmith. Lyrically, Cockburn has returned to the terrain he alone inhabits: intimate observations of the personal, the spiritual, the sociopolitical and environmental concerns. As is also his wont, there are no sloganeering anthems in these songs. Form the title track that opens the album he looks across the Montreal landscape and observes it, not in a journalistic way, but as someone inside it, and he asks poignantly. ~Can one man fit in a normal life?~ The solitary person in the midst of unions, holy and unholy, can find no way to properly say goodbye or welcome.</p> <p>Ani DiFranco sings backing vocals on ~See You Tomorrow,~ where Cockburn turns the tables on himself as he observes a mercenary, and though he understands the man's empty soul he envies his freedom from guilt to accomplish his task. Isolation in the midst of watching women walk mirrors the pain of sin and of loneliness for the beloved and seeks wholeness which he expresses that beyond ~these chains of flesh~ there is completion. The gentleness of his approach is also notable. Cockburn isn't raging here, he's expressing the hidden, the unseen, the unspeakable. Check the lovely, languid folk song ~Mystery,~ where he embraces what is unknowable infinitely despite his fear and his hunger for it. A four-piece horn section adorns the mix on the outside, underscoring the questions in the grain of the singer's voice. What happens as the record unfolds is the work of a poet who happens to be a brilliant musician, who has refined his craft not as an aesthete, but as a hands-dirtied participant not only in the process, but in its realization: check the gorgeous falsetto that croons above the swell of strings in ~Beautiful Creatures.~ He asks straight up, from the gut: ~When the skin is peeled off it/What is there to say?~ And then says it: The beautiful creatures are/going away...~</p><p>In many ways, there is a tenderness here that Cockburn's listeners haven't encountered since ~Humans,~ where fear, desire, shock, awe and boundless love poured from his songs. And they do so here, too, tempered by a bloody but unbowed veteran of love, despair, spiritual hunger, desolation and the acknowledgement of community. Always a guitar to accompany that voice, always six strings whispering through the singer and carrying him through not only emotions, but scenes, places, times, encounters, to be able to speak clearly and directly, yet softly, with one exception: ~This Is Baghdad.~ Here the observer battles the brokenness inside himself as he observes -- Cockburn spent part of 2004 there -- the mindless destruction for the sake of nothing whatsoever. The display of might by American troops under the guidance of a fearful leader is revealed for what it is: the display of power for its own sake, which is for the sake of nothing. The deep end of the string section hovers around his 12-string, and the hypnotic pulse of Gary Craig's drums.</p></p>There are three fine instrumentals here as well. ~Peace March,~ is driven by that now-trademark fluid guitar kissed with a brushed snare, a tempered bassline which reveals the refined texture of a master painter. ~Jerusalem Poker~ with its handclapped percussion is a jazz tune with its syncopated guitar and muted flugelhorn. The album's final cut, too, named for Marcel Duchamp's infamous ~Nude Descending a Staircase~ is introduced by radio static, and then seamlessly flows into a guitar drive jazz tune with Cockburn playing a Byrdland electric guitar doing his best Wes Montgomery as strings shimmer and spiral down and a muted trumpet pushes down on the proceeding as more found sounds carry it out before the final cocking of what seems like a gun before the silence abruptly drapes the entire proceeding. Life Short Call Now is absent of metonymy or metaphor; it reports from the inside what is, and what should never be with equal wait, all the yearning for a convergence and a dusty grace to cover it all. Life Short Call Now reveals a seasoned artist at the absolute height of his powers lyrically and musically.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Speechless is proof in the pudding that you can teach an old dog new tricks. Old dog? Take a look at Bruce Cockburn's photo in the CD booklet. Speechless is the singer/songwriter's first foray into completely instrumental territory. There are 15 tracks here, the vast majority of which are redos of tracks from Cockburn's catalog. But given their treatment -- many of them done as solo guitar pieces -- the dearth of new material doesn't even matter. In fact, one could venture to say that these feel like altogether new pieces. Cockburn is a master guitarist; he often interweaves jazz, blues, country, and folk styles into his cross-genre songs. Here he shines, pure and simple. ~Train in the Rain~ (anyone notice how many of his songs are about trains and travel?) touches on Leo Kottke and Peter Lang; ~Water into Wine~ utilizes flamenco stylings while crossing into Gypsy jazz chords à la Charlie Byrd. A new work, ~Elegy,~ kisses the modalities of ~Greensleeves~ while creating itself as a piece that evokes both absence and memory. ~Rouler Sa Bosse~ from Salt, Sun and Time juxtaposes Cockburn's six-string against Jack Zaza's clarinet, and becomes a straight-up gently swinging jazz tune. The set also includes ~Rise and Fall,~ a sought-after trio track that was previously available only in Japan. Cockburn's steel-string is accented by his playing of bells, George Koller on bass, and drummer, Ben Riley! The new version of ~When It's Gone, It's Gone~ showcases an entire band that includes Booker T. Jones on organ and Edgar Meyer on bass, and is the only electric tune on the set. Another new work, ~The End of All Rivers,~ is a multi-tracked tune that has Cockburn playing not only guitar but Tibetan bowl, a Navajo flute, and a baritone guitar, which are all threaded though the melody as a digital delay marks time with his standard acoustic. It's spooky, elegiac, and utterly beguiling. The set ends with a down-home solo read of the title track from Sunwheel Dance. The most remarkable thing about Speechless is that, although it lies firmly in its own subcategory in Cockburn's catalog, it remains, despite the improvisation and textures, a recording of songs. The composer's need to establish that fact even in abstraction and extrapolation is commendable. Speechless is not only accessible -- it's downright beautiful, poetic, and seductive.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So pronounced is Bruce Cockburn's reputation as a celebrated singer-songwriter that it's easy to overlook the fact that Cockburn is also an exceptional guitarist. Speechless should change all that. A collection of previously recorded and brand new instrumental tracks, the album puts the spotlight squarely on Cockburn's brilliant acoustic guitar playing. Despite its absence of words, Speechless is highly expressive. Ranging from some of his earliest numbers to three recent compositions, the album showcases the breadth of Cockburn's eclectic guitar style. There's a strong cinematic quality to much of the album, whether it's in pieces from the 1970s like the haunting ~Islands in a Black Sky~ and the cascading ~Water into Wine,~ or else in 1990s instrumentals such as the emotional ~When It's Gone It's Gone~ and the ambient ~Mistress of Storms.~</p>&mdash; <b>Amazon</b>"

While the acoustic element has always been a primary part of his stage persona, fans — and the merely curious — have never had access to an official live document of those proceedings, until now. This double-disc set is a generous offering of 25 songs from all different stages of Cockburn's career, taped during May 2008. There were ten shows, and all of them have been sampled here, though the double-disc package has been edited to flow like a single performance in hopes of maintaining the flavor of a given concert. What's more, Cockburn and producer Colin Linden went a step further and added three tunes from the various soundchecks that took place before the gigs as a sort of encore. Along with Cockburn's stellar collection of songs, such as ~World of Wonders,~ ~Lovers in a Dangerous Time,~ ~How I Spent My Fall Vacation,~ ~Wondering Where the Lions Are,~ ~If I Had a Rocket Launcher,~ and ~Tie Me at the Crossroads,~ are beautiful instrumental interludes within tunes — and on the final disc as an intro to the soundcheck performances — that offer his mastery of the guitar as well. Among the final performances is a fine version of his early classic ~Mama Just Wants to Barrelhouse All Night Long.~ While it's true that there is nothing new here, that doesn't diminish the sense of creativity and spontaneity Cockburn is capable of in concert, making this a deeply rewarding purchase for longtime fans.</p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong>"

		"firstname": "Leonard",
		"lastname": "Cohen",
		"name": "Leonard Cohen",
		"biography": "<p>One of the most fascinating and enigmatic -- if not the most successful -- singer/songwriters of the late '60s, Leonard Cohen retained an audience across six decades of music-making, interrupted by various digressions into personal and creative exploration, all of which have only added to the mystique surrounding him. Second only to Bob Dylan (and perhaps Paul Simon), he commanded the attention of critics and younger musicians more firmly than any other musical figure from the '60s who continued to work in the 21st century, which is all the more remarkable an achievement for someone who didn't even aspire to a musical career until he was in his thirties.</p><p>Cohen was born in 1934, a year before Elvis Presley, and his background -- personal, social, and intellectual -- couldn't have been more different from those of the rock or folk stars of any generation. Though he knew some country music and played it a bit as a boy, he didn't start performing on even a semi-regular basis, much less recording, until after he had already written several books -- and as an established novelist and poet, his literary accomplishments far exceeded those of Bob Dylan or most anyone else who one cares to mention in music.</p><p>He was born Leonard Norman Cohen into a middle-class Jewish family in the Montreal suburb of Westmount. His father, a clothing merchant (who also held a degree in engineering), died in 1943, when Cohen was nine years old. It was his mother who encouraged Cohen as a writer, especially of poetry, during his childhood. This fit in with the progressive intellectual environment in which he was raised, which allowed him free inquiry into a vast range of pursuits. His relationship to music was more tentative. He took up the guitar at age 13, initially as a way to impress a girl, but was good enough to play country & western songs at local cafes, and he subsequently formed a group called the Buckskin Boys. At 17, he enrolled in McGill University as an English major. By this time, he was writing poetry in earnest and became part of the university's tiny underground ~bohemian~ community. Cohen only earned average grades, but was good enough as a writer to earn the McNaughton Prize in creative writing by the time he graduated in 1955. A year later, the ink barely dry on his degree, he published his first book of poetry, Let Us Compare Mythologies (1956), which got great reviews but didn't sell especially well.</p><p>He was already beyond the age that rock & roll was aimed at. Bob Dylan, by contrast, was still Robert Zimmerman, still in his teens, and young enough to become a devotee of Buddy Holly when the latter emerged. In 1961, Cohen published his second book of poetry, The Spice Box of Earth, which became an international success critically and commercially, and established Cohen as a major new literary figure. Meanwhile, he tried to join the family business and spent some time at Columbia University in New York, writing all the time. Between the modest royalties from sales of his second book, literary grants from the Canadian government, and a family legacy, he was able to live comfortably and travel around the world, partaking of much of what it had to offer -- including some use of LSD when it was still legal -- and ultimately settling for an extended period in Greece, on the isle of Hydra in the Aegean Sea. He continued to publish, issuing a pair of novels, The Favorite Game (1963) and Beautiful Losers (1966), with a pair of poetry collections, Flowers for Hitler (1964) and Parasites of Heaven (1966). The Favorite Game was a very personal work about his early life in Montreal, but it was Beautiful Losers that proved another breakthrough, earning the kind of reviews that authors dare not even hope for. (Cohen found himself compared to James Joyce in the pages of The Boston Globe, and across the years, the book has enjoyed sales totaling well into six figures.)</p><p>It was around this time that he also started writing music again, songs being a natural extension of his poetry. His relative isolation on Hydra, coupled with his highly mobile lifestyle when he left the island, his own natural iconoclastic nature, and the fact that he'd avoided being overwhelmed (or even touched too seriously) by the currents running through popular music since the '40s, combined to give Cohen a unique voice as a composer. Though he did settle in Nashville for a short time in the mid-'60s, he didn't write quite like anyone else in the country music mecca or anywhere else. This might have been an impediment, but for the intervention of Judy Collins, a folksinger who had just moved to the front rank of that field. Collins had a voice just special enough to move her beyond the relatively emaciated ranks of remaining popular folk performers after Dylan shifted to electric music; she was still getting heard, and not just by the purists left behind in Dylan's wake. She added Cohen's ~Suzanne~ to her repertoire and put it on her album In My Life, a record that was controversial enough in folk circles (because of her cover of the Beatles song that gave the LP its title) to pull in a lot of listeners and get a wide airing. The LP's ~Suzanne~ received a considerable amount of radio airplay, and Cohen was also represented on the album by ~Dress Rehearsal Rag.~</p><p>It was Collins who persuaded Cohen to return to performing for the first time since his teens. He made his debut during the summer of 1967 at the Newport Folk Festival, followed by a pair of sold-out concerts in New York City and an appearance singing his songs and reciting his poems on the CBS network television show Camera Three, in a show entitled ~Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Leonard Cohen.~ It was around the same time that actor/singer Noel Harrison brought ~Suzanne~ onto the pop charts with a recording of his own. One of those who saw Cohen perform at Newport was John Hammond, Sr., the legendary producer whose career went back to the '30s and the likes of Billie Holiday, Benny Goodman, and Count Basie, and extended up through Bob Dylan and, ultimately, to Bruce Springsteen. Hammond got Cohen signed to Columbia Records and he created The Songs of Leonard Cohen, which was released just before Christmas of 1967. Producer John Simon was able to find a restrained yet appealing approach to recording Cohen's voice, which might have been described as an appealingly sensitive near-monotone; yet that voice was perfectly suited to the material at hand, all of which, written in a very personal language, seemed drenched in downbeat images and a spirit of discovery as a path to unsettling revelation.</p><p>Despite its spare production and melancholy subject matter -- or, very possibly because of it -- the album was an immediate hit by the standards of the folk music world and the budding singer/songwriter community. In an era in which millions of listeners hung on the next albums of Bob Dylan and Simon & Garfunkel -- whose own latest album had ended with a minor-key rendition of ~Silent Night~ set against a radio news account of the death of Lenny Bruce -- Cohen's music quickly found a small but dedicated following. College students by the thousands bought it; in its second year of release, the record sold over 100,000 copies. The Songs of Leonard Cohen was as close as Cohen ever got to mass audience success.</p><p>Amid all of this sudden musical activity, he hardly neglected his other writing -- in 1968, he released a new volume, Selected Poems: 1956-1968, which included both old and newly published work, and earned him the Governor General's Award, Canada's highest literary honor, which he proceeded to decline. By this time, he was actually almost more a part of the rock scene, residing for a time in New York's Chelsea Hotel, where his neighbors included Janis Joplin and other performing luminaries, some of whom influenced his songs very directly.</p><p>His next album, Songs from a Room (1969), was characterized by an even greater spirit of melancholy -- even the relatively spirited ~A Bunch of Lonesome Heroes~ was steeped in such depressing sensibilities, and the one song not written by Cohen, ~The Partisan,~ was a grim narrative about the reasons for and consequences of resistance to tyranny that included lines like ~She died without a whisper~ and included images of wind blowing past graves. Joan Baez subsequently recorded the song, and in her hands it was a bit more upbeat and inspiring to the listener; Cohen's rendition made it much more difficult to get past the costs presented by the singer's persona. On the other hand, ~Seems So Long Ago, Nancy,~ although as downbeat as anything else here, did present Cohen in his most expressive and commercial voice, a nasal but affecting and finely nuanced performance.</p><p>In all, however, Songs from a Room was less well-received commercially and critically. Bob Johnston's restrained, almost minimalist production made it less overtly appealing than the subtly commercial trappings of his debut, though the album did have a pair of tracks, ~Bird on the Wire~ and ~The Story of Isaac,~ that became standards rivaling ~Suzanne.~ ~The Story of Isaac,~ a musical parable woven around biblical imagery about Vietnam, was one of the most savage and piercing songs to come out of the antiwar movement, and showed a level of sophistication in its music and lyrics that put it in a whole separate realm of composition; it received an even better airing on the Live Songs album, in a performance recorded in Berlin during 1972.</p><p>Cohen may not have been a widely popular performer or recording artist, but his unique voice and sound, and the power of his writing and its influence, helped him gain entry to the front rank of rock performers, an odd status for the then 35-year-old author/composer. He appeared at the 1970 Isle of Wight festival in England, a post-Woodstock gathering of stars and superstars, including late appearances by such soon-to-die-or-disband legends as Jimi Hendrix and the Doors. Looking nearly as awkward as his fellow Canadian Joni Mitchell, Cohen strummed his acoustic guitar backed by a pair of female singers in front of an audience of 600,000 (~It's a large nation, but still weak~), comprising equal portions of fans, freaks, and belligerent gatecrashers, but the mere fact that he was there -- sandwiched somewhere between Miles Davis and Emerson, Lake & Palmer -- was a clear statement of the status (if not the popular success) he'd achieved. (Cohen's performance of ~Suzanne~ was one of the highlights of Murray Lerner's long-delayed 1996 documentary Message to Love: The Isle of Wight Festival, and his full set was reissued in 2009, both on audio and video formats.)</p><p>Already, he had carved out a unique place for himself in music, as much author as performer and recording artist, letting his songs develop and evolve across years -- his distinctly non-commercial voice became part of his appeal to the audience he found, giving him a unique corner of the music audience comprising listeners descended from the same people who had embraced Bob Dylan's early work before he'd become a mass-media phenomenon in 1964. In a sense, Cohen embodied a phenomenon vaguely similar to what Dylan enjoyed before his early-'70s tour with the Band -- people bought his albums by the tens and, occasionally, hundreds of thousands, but seemed to hear him in uniquely personal terms. He earned his audience seemingly one listener at a time, by word of mouth more than by the radio, which, in any case (especially on the AM dial), was mostly friendly to covers of Cohen's songs by other artists.</p><p>Cohen's third album, Songs of Love and Hate (1971), was one of his most powerful works, brimming with piercing lyrics and music as poignantly affecting as it was minimalist in its approach -- arranger Paul Buckmaster's work on strings was peculiarly muted, and the children's chorus that showed up on ~Last Year's Man~ was spare in its presence. Balancing them was Cohen's most effective vocalizing to date, brilliantly expressive around such acclaimed songs as ~Joan of Arc,~ ~Dress Rehearsal Rag~ (which had been recorded by Judy Collins five years before), and ~Famous Blue Raincoat.~ The bleakness of the tone and subject matter ensured that he would never become a ~pop~ performer; even the beat-driven ~Diamonds in the Mine~ -- catchy children's chorus accompaniment and all, with a twangy electric guitar accompaniment to boot -- was as dark and venomous a song as Columbia Records put out in 1971. And the most compelling moments -- among an embarrassment of riches -- came on lyrics like ~Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc/As she came riding through the dark/No moon to keep her armor bright/No man to get her through this night....~ Songs of Love and Hate, coupled with the earlier hit versions of ~Suzanne,~ etc., earned Cohen a large international cult following. He also found himself in demand in the world of commercial filmmaking, as director Robert Altman used his music in his 1971 feature film McCabe and Mrs. Miller, starring Warren Beatty and Julie Christie, a revisionist period film set at the turn of the 19th century that was savaged by the critics (and, by some accounts, sabotaged by its own studio) but went on to become one of the director's best-loved movies. The following year, he also published a new poetry collection, The Energy of Slaves.</p><p>As was his wont, Cohen spent years between albums, and in 1973 he seemed to take stock of himself as a performer by issuing Leonard Cohen: Live Songs. Not a conventional live album, it was a compendium of performances from various venues across several years and focused on highlights of his output from 1969 onward. It showcased his writing as much as his performing, but also gave a good account of his appeal to his most serious fans -- those still uncertain of where they stood in relation to his music who could get past the epic-length ~Please Don't Pass Me By~ knew for certain they were ready to ~join~ the inner circle of his legion of devotees after that, while others who only appreciated ~Bird on the Wire~ or ~The Story of Isaac~ could stay comfortably in an outer ring.</p><p>Meanwhile, in 1973, his music became the basis for a theatrical production called Sisters of Mercy, conceived by Gene Lesser and loosely based on Cohen's life, or at least a fantasy version of his life. A three-year lag ensued between Songs of Love and Hate and Cohen's next album, and most critics and fans just assumed he'd hit a dry spell, with the live album covering the gap. He was busy performing, however, in the United States and Europe in 1971 and 1972, and extended his appearances into Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. It was during this period that he also began working with pianist and arranger John Lissauer, whom he engaged as producer of his next album, New Skin for the Old Ceremony (1974). That album seemed to justify his fans' continued faith in his work, presenting Cohen in a more lavish musical environment. He proved capable of holding his own in a pop environment, even if the songs were mostly still depressing and bleak.</p><p>The following year, Columbia Records released The Best of Leonard Cohen, featuring a dozen of his best-known songs -- principally hits in the hands of other performers -- from his previous four LPs (though it left out ~Dress Rehearsal Rag~). It was also during the mid-'70s that Cohen first crossed paths professionally with Jennifer Warnes, appearing on the same bill with the singer at numerous shows, which would lead to a series of key collaborations in the ensuing decade. By this time, he was a somewhat less mysterious persona, having toured extensively and gotten considerable exposure -- among many other attributes, Cohen became known for his uncanny attractiveness to women, which seemed to go hand in glove with the romantic subjects of most of his songs.</p><p>In 1977, Cohen reappeared with the ironically titled Death of a Ladies' Man, the most controversial album of his career, produced by Phil Spector. The notion of pairing Spector -- known variously as a Svengali-like presence to his female singers and artists and the most unrepentant (and often justified) over-producer in the field of pop music -- with Cohen must have seemed like a good one to someone at some point, but apparently Cohen himself had misgivings about many of the resulting tracks that Spector never addressed, having mixed the record completely on his own. The resulting LP suffered from the worst attributes of Cohen's and Spector's work, overly dense and self-consciously imposing in its sound, and virtually bathing the listener in Cohen's depressive persona, but showing his limited vocal abilities to disadvantage, owing to Spector's use of ~scratch~ (i.e. guide) vocals and his unwillingness to permit the artist to redo some of his weaker moments on those takes. For the first (and only) time in Cohen's career, his near-monotone delivery of this period wasn't a positive attribute. Cohen's unhappiness with the album was widely known among fans, who mostly bought it with that caveat in mind, so it didn't harm his reputation. A year after its release, Cohen also published a new literary collection using the slightly different title Death of a Lady's Man.</p><p>Cohen's next album, Recent Songs (1979), returned him to the spare settings of his early-'70s work and showed his singing to some of its best advantage. Working with veteran producer Henry Lewy (best known for his work with Joni Mitchell), the album showed Cohen's singing as attractive and expressive in its quiet way, and songs such as ~The Guests~ seeming downright pretty. He still wrote about life and love, and especially relationships, in stark terms, but he seemed to be moving into a pop mode on numbers such as ~Humbled in Love.~ Frank Sinatra never needed to look over his shoulder at Cohen (at least, as a singer), but he did seem to be trying for a slicker pop sound at moments on his record.</p><p>Then came 1984, and two key new works in Cohen's output -- the poetic/religious volume The Book of Mercy and the album Various Positions (1984). The latter, recorded with Jennifer Warnes, is arguably the most accessible album of his entire career up to that time -- Cohen's voice, now a peculiarly expressive baritone instrument, found a beautiful pairing with Warnes, and the songs were as fine as ever, steeped in spirituality and sexuality, with ~Dance Me to the End of Love~ a killer opener: a wry, doom-laden yet impassioned pop-style ballad that is impossible to forget. Those efforts overlapped with some ventures by the composer/singer into other creative realms, including an award-winning short film that he wrote, directed, and scored, entitled I Am a Hotel, and the score for the 1985 conceptual film Night Magic, which earned a Juno Award in Canada for Best Movie Score.</p><p>Sad to say, Various Positions went relatively unnoticed, and was followed by another extended sabbatical from recording, which ended with I'm Your Man (1988). But during his hiatus, Warnes had released her album of Cohen-authored material, entitled Famous Blue Raincoat, which had sold extremely well and introduced Cohen to a new generation of listeners. So when I'm Your Man did appear, with its electronic production (albeit still rather spare) and songs that added humor (albeit dark humor) to his mix of pessimistic and poetic conceits, the result was his best-selling record in more than a decade. The result, in 1991, was the release of I'm Your Fan: The Songs of Leonard Cohen, a CD of recordings of his songs by the likes of R.E.M., the Pixies, Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds, and John Cale, which put Cohen as a songwriter pushing age 60 right back on center stage for the '90s. He rose to the occasion, releasing The Future, an album that dwelt on the many threats facing mankind in the coming years and decades, a year later. Not the stuff of pop charts or MTV heavy rotation, it attracted Cohen's usual coterie of fans, and enough press interest as well as sufficient sales, to justify the release in 1994 of his second concert album, Cohen Live, derived from his two most recent tours. A year later came another tribute album, Tower of Song, featuring Cohen's songs as interpreted by Billy Joel, Willie Nelson, et al.</p><p>In the midst of all of this new activity surrounding his writing and compositions, Cohen embarked on a new phase of his life. Religious concerns were never too far from his thinking and work, even when he was making a name for himself writing songs about love, and he had focused even more on this side of life since Various Positions. He spent time at the Mt. Baldy Zen Center, a Buddhist retreat in California, and eventually became a full-time resident, and a Buddhist monk in the late '90s. When he re-emerged in 1999, Cohen had many dozens of new compositions in hand, songs and poems alike. His new collaborations were with singer/songwriter/musician Sharon Robinson, who also ended up producing the resulting album, Ten New Songs (2001) -- there also emerged during this period a release called Field Commander Cohen: Tour of 1979, comprised of live recordings from his tour 22 years earlier.</p><p>In 2004, the year he turned 70, Cohen released one of the most controversial albums of his career, Dear Heather. It revealed his voice anew, in this phase of his career, as a deep baritone more limited in range than on any previous recording, but it overcame this change in vocal timbre by facing it head-on, just as Cohen had done with his singing throughout his career. It also contained a number of songs for which Cohen wrote music but not lyrics, a decided change of pace for a man who'd started out as a poet. And it was as personal a record as Cohen had ever issued. His return to recording was one of the more positive aspects of Cohen's resumption of his music activities. On another note, in 2005, he filed suit against his longtime business manager and his financial advisor over the alleged theft of more than five million dollars, at least some of which took place during his years at the Buddhist retreat.</p><p>Five decades after he emerged as a public literary figure and then a performer, Cohen remained one of the most compelling and enigmatic musical figures of his era, and one of the very few of that era who commanded as much respect and attention, and probably as large an audience, in the 21st century as he did in the '60s. As much as any survivor of that decade, Cohen held onto his original audience and saw it grow across generations, in keeping with a truly timeless and ageless body of music. In 2006, his enduring influence seemed to be acknowledged in Lions Gate Films' release of Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man, director Lian Lunson's concert/portrait of Cohen's work and career. A performance set, Live in London, was released in 2009. In 2010, the combined video and audio package Songs from the Road was issued, documenting his 2008 world tour (which actually lasted until late 2010), revisiting songs from each part of his career. The tour covered 84 dates and sold over 700,000 tickets worldwide.</p><p>Cohen didn't rest long, however: in early 2011 he began to craft what would become Old Ideas, his first album of new material in seven years. The sessions took place with producers Ed Sanders (renowned poet and leader of the Fugs), Patrick Leonard, Cohen's saxophonist Dino Soldo, and his partner, singer and songwriter Anjani Thomas. Old Ideas contained ten new songs dealing with spirituality, mortality, sexuality, loss, and acceptance, similar in sound and texture to Dear Heather. The tracks ~Lullaby~ and ~Darkness~ were staples of the world tour, while the cut ~Show Me the Place~ was pre-released in late 2011. Old Ideas was released at the end of January 2012. It was a tremendous success, debuting inside the Top Five in the U.S. and U.K., as well as reaching number one in Canada. Cohen's success in Europe was more impressive; Old Ideas reached number one in almost ten countries.</p><p>After yet another world tour that brought him universal accolades, Cohen, uncharacteristically, returned quickly to the studio with producer (and co-writer) Patrick Leonard, emerging with nine new songs, at least one of which -- ~Born in Chains~ -- had origins that dated back 40 years. Popular Problems was released in September of 2014 to positive reviews and chart success. (Just like its predecessor, it hit number one across Europe as well as Canada.) Cohen continued to tour internationally with impressive vigor, and in December 2014 he released Live in Dublin, his third live album since returning to the road. The album had been recorded in September 2013, during a concert at Dublin's O2 Arena, and a high-definition video release appeared in tandem with the audio edition. Yet another concert document, Can't Forget: A Souvenir of the Grand Tour, appeared in May 2015, with the album drawn from live takes as well as pre-show rehearsals at soundchecks. Cohen went right back to work on new material although he was in declining health. On September 21, 2016, his 82nd birthday, ~You Want It Darker,~ the eerie, mortality-themed title track of a new studio album, appeared on the Internet. The full-length, produced by his son Adam, was issued on October 21. The record was his goodbye; Cohen passed away less than three weeks later, on November 7, 2016. </p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>At a time when a growing number of pop songwriters were embracing a more explicitly poetic approach in their lyrics, the 1967 debut album from Leonard Cohen introduced a songwriter who, rather than being inspired by ~serious~ literature, took up music after establishing himself as a published author and poet. The ten songs on Songs of Leonard Cohen were certainly beautifully constructed, artful in a way few (if any) other lyricists would approach for some time, but what's most striking about these songs isn't Cohen's technique, superb as it is, so much as his portraits of a world dominated by love and lust, rage and need, compassion and betrayal. While the relationship between men and women was often the framework for Cohen's songs (he didn't earn the nickname ~the master of erotic despair~ for nothing), he didn't write about love; rather, Cohen used the never-ending thrust and parry between the sexes as a jumping off point for his obsessive investigation of humanity's occasional kindness and frequent atrocities (both emotional and physical).</p><p>Cohen's world view would be heady stuff at nearly any time and place, but coming in a year when pop music was only just beginning to be taken seriously, Songs of Leonard Cohen was a truly audacious achievement, as bold a challenge to pop music conventions as the other great debut of the year, The Velvet Underground & Nico, and a nearly perfectly realized product of his creative imagination. Producer John Simon added a touch of polish to Cohen's songs with his arrangements (originally Cohen wanted no accompaniment other than his guitar), though the results don't detract from his dry but emotive vocals; instead, they complement his lyrics with a thoughtful beauty and give the songs even greater strength. And a number of Cohen's finest songs appeared here, including the luminous ~Suzanne,~ the subtly venomous ~Master Song~ and ~Sisters of Mercy,~ which would later be used to memorable effect in Robert Altman's film McCabe and Mrs. Miller. Many artists work their whole career to create a work as singular and accomplished as Songs of Leonard Cohen, and Cohen worked this alchemy the first time he entered a recording studio; few musicians have ever created a more remarkable or enduring debut.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Leonard Cohen's first album was an unqualified triumph which announced the arrival of a bold and singular talent, and many who heard it must have wondered what Cohen could do for an encore. By comparison, Cohen's second album, 1969's Songs from a Room, was something of a letdown. While it's a fine LP, it ultimately feels neither as striking nor as assured as Songs of Leonard Cohen. Bob Johnston stepped in as producer for Songs from a Room, and his arrangements are simpler than those John Simon crafted for the debut, but they're also full of puzzling accents, such as the jew's harp that punctuates several tracks, the churchy organ line in ~The Old Revolution,~ and the harsh synthesizer flourishes on ~A Bunch of Lonesome Heroes.~ Johnston also had trouble coaxing strong vocal performances from Cohen; his singing here sounds tentative and his meter is uncertain, which regardless of how one feels about Cohen's much-debated vocal prowess is not the case with his other work. And finally, the quality of the songs on Songs from a Room is less consistent than on Songs of Leonard Cohen; as fine as ~Bird on a Wire,~ ~You Know Who I Am,~ ~The Story of Isaac~ and ~Seems So Long Ago, Nancy~ may be, ~The Butcher~ and ~A Bunch of Lonesome Heroes~ simply aren't up to his usual standards. Despite the album's flaws, Songs from a Room's strongest moments convey a naked intimacy and fearless emotional honesty that's every bit as powerful as the debut, and it left no doubt that Cohen was a major creative force in contemporary songwriting.</p><p><strong>&mdash; Mark Deming</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Difficult to find and seemingly assembled from spare parts, Live Songs is the shabby orphan in Leonard Cohen's catalog. It is also one of his most thrilling releases. Culled from a series of 1972 concerts (except for ~Tonight Will Be Fine~ from the Isle of Wight festival), the album consists of compositions from 1969's Songs From a Room and a handful of otherwise unavailable material. Those familiar with Songs From a Room will find that the live versions improve upon their studio counterparts, which sound like they were recorded down a well. The spirited hoedown rendition of ~Tonight Will Be Fine~ includes two extra verses, and the lovely, restrained performance of ~Bird on the Wire~ may be definitive. As for the oddities, Dick Blakeslee's spry political allegory, ~Passing Through,~ suits Cohen's dry delivery, and the hypnotic instrumental ~Improvisation~ reveals a rarely seen side of his musical personality. Curiously enough, the haunting prologue and the poem-as-dirge ~Queen Victoria~ don't seem to have been recorded live at all. The centerpiece of the album, however, is ~Please Don't Pass Me By,~ a monstrous 12-minute rant, both outrageous and deadly serious, apparently half written, half made up on the spot. Cohen dedicates the song to a host of outcasts, including ~the cripples, the maimed, the freaks...the burned, the burning...the Jews and the gypsies~ killed in the Holocaust, ~the children of England,~ and ~a savior with no one to save,~ then goes on to beg some unspecified addressee (the listener?) to get naked for him. Before the song is over, he declares that he can't stand himself and instructs the members of the audience to ~go home with someone else.~ Only a daredevil artist could freak out so totally and articulately before a crowd of paying customers. Cohen fanatics will know they've hit the jackpot when they hear Live Songs. Anyone who cares about poetry and raw emotional honesty in popular music should at least find it interesting.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Daniel Browne</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Few artists have maintained such a devoted fan base for so long outside the mainstream as Leonard Cohen. With such a rich catalog, any compilation of his material is bound to invite discussion. Cohen Live opts to balance earlier material with work from his late-'80s/early-'90s period culled from two different tours. The newer songs include the lovely ~Dance Me to the End of Love,~ the ominous ~Everybody Knows,~ and ~I'm Your Man.~ Cohen classics such as ~Bird on a Wire,~ ~Who By Fire?,~ and ~Suzanne~ are among the older songs. Backed by strong musicians, Cohen delivers the songs in his monotone rasp that is distinctly him. The renditions are fairly faithful to the studio versions, although the added warmth of the live performers provides an interesting contrast with Cohen's baleful persona. Cohen Live isn't necessarily essential, but fans will enjoy hearing one of the more original and enduring voices from the '60s in a different setting.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Tom Demalon</strong></p>"

		"biography": "<p>Coldplay never intended to become England's favorite rock & roll sons when their signature rock melodies ruled the charts throughout 2000. The Brit-rock quartet -- composed of Chris Martin (vocals/piano), Jon Buckland (guitar), Will Champion (drums), and Guy Berryman (bass) -- yearned to mess around a bit, plucking their own acoustics for fun while attending the University College of London. All had been playing instruments since their early teens and had been influenced by the likes of Bob Dylan, the Stone Roses, Neil Young, and My Bloody Valentine.</p><p>They never imagined taking reign of the U.K.'s ever-changing rock scene. Each member had come from solid households of working-class parents that encouraged music to be played. Martin, the eldest of five, began playing the piano as a young child. He started playing in bands around age 15 and sought solace in the words of Tom Waits. Buckland, on the other hand, was into the heavy guitar work of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix and was playing guitar by age 11. Scotland native Berryman was into funk instead of indie rock, therefore leaving him to play bass. The multi-instrumentalist, Champion, didn't plan to be a drummer until he joined Coldplay. He favored playing guitar, bass, and the tin whistle, but caught on to playing percussion when the band became official.</p><p>Coldplay was heart-rending like Travis, passionate like Jeff Buckley, and as fresh as Oasis when they first burst onto the scene, so it was ideal for the press and public to praise them. They played their first gig at a festival for unsigned bands in Manchester, and The Safety EP was issued shortly thereafter. The Brothers and Sisters EP was issued by Fierce Panda and released a year later. Both releases saw only 500 pressings. Their sweet melodies and swooning lyrics landed Coldplay a U.K. deal with Parlophone in April 1999, and the limited-edition five-track, The <i>Blue Room</i> EP, followed that fall. With endearing nods from the media, the dream pop foursome were hailed as the next Travis thanks to their simplistic acoustics and charming personas. Two more EPs, <i>Shiver</i> and <i>Yellow</i>, arrived in spring 2000.</p><p>Their full-length debut <i>Parachutes</i>, which earned the band a Mercury Music Prize nomination, was released in the U.K. In November 2000, <i>Parachutes</i> saw a U.S. release with Nettwerk; a month later, ~Yellow~ was chosen as the theme song for all promo spots for ABC. The well-received hype surrounding the band continued throughout 2001 as well, taking on three Brit Awards nominations and a sold-out ten-date tour of the U.S. in February. Rumors of a split consumed most of the U.S. tour. Martin frequently battled nasty colds and voice exhaustion, which led Coldplay to cancel a series of American dates and scrap a European tour. With all gossip aside, Coldplay resumed playing in summer 2001 and earned additional success with second single ~Trouble.~</p><p>By fall, they headed into the studio for a second album. Rumor had it that it might be Coldplay's last album, for the band felt they might not capture such brilliance again. <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i> was released in August 2002.</p>&mdash; <b>MacKenzie Wilson</b> ",

Not as heavy as Radiohead or snobbish as Oasis, Coldplay is a band of young musicians who are still honing their sweet harmonies on the debut release <i>Parachutes</i>. Combining bits of distorted guitar riffs and swishing percussion, <i>Parachutes</i> is a delightful introduction and also quickly indicates the reason why this album earned Coldplay a Mercury Music Prize nomination in fall 2000.</p><p>Frontman Chris Martin's lyrical wordplay is feministic in the manner of Geneva's Andrew Montgomery, but far more withered. The imagery captured on <i>Parachutes</i> is exquisitely dark and artistically abrasive, and the entire composition is tractable thanks to gauzy acoustics and airy percussion. Coldplay's indie rock inclinations are also obvious, especially on songs such as ~Don't Panic~ and ~Shiver,~ but it's the dream pop soundscapes captured on ~High Speed~ and ~We Never Change~ that illustrate the band's dynamic passion. This basic pop is surely a refreshing effort in the face of big productions like the Spice Girls and Westlife. <i>Parachutes</i> deserves the accolades it has received because it follows the general rule when introducing decent pop songs: keep the emotion genuine and real. And Coldplay has done that without hesitation.</p><p>— <b>MacKenzie Wilson</b></p>"

				"review": "<p>After touring in support of their debut album, <i>Parachutes</i>, Coldplay was personally and professionally exhausted. Frontman Chris Martin insisted he was dry; by the time they closed their European tour in summer 2001, he hadn't written a song in months. The U.K. music press immediately pounced on the idea of Coldplay calling it quits, but somewhere lurked the beauty of ~In My Place.~ The spirit and soul of this ballad allowed Coldplay to pull it together to make a second album. What came from such anguish and inquisition was <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i>. Coldplay has surely let it all go on this record. Acoustics are drowned out by Jon Buckland's riveting guitar work, and vocally, Martin has sharpened his falsetto, refining his haunting delivery. It's a strong album; you can feel, hear, and touch the blood, sweat, and tears behind each song, and that's exactly what Coldplay was going for. Co-producer Ken Nelson and mixer Mark Pythain (the team behind the blissful beauty of <i>Parachutes</i>) allowed Coldplay to make an album that's initially inaccessible, but that's what makes it intriguing. Lush melodies and a heartbreak behind the songs are there, but also a newfound confidence.</p><p>From the delicate, shimmery classic ~In My Place~ to the piano surge of ~The Scientist,~ Coldplay exudes an honest passion. The disco haze of ~Daylight~ and the lovedrunk ballad ~Green Eyes~ are divine examples of solid lyrical arrangements, but ~Politik~ and the stunning guitar-driven ~God Put a Smile Upon Your Face~ project a nervy edge to the band. Echoes of early post-punk showcase Coldplay's ballsy musicianship. Don't fret — it's not exactly rock &amp; roll, but Radiohead, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, and The Smiths aren't exactly rock &amp; roll either, and they're well-loved. ~Yellow~ didn't follow the rock formula, but it sold well, and similarly <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i> might not instantly grab listeners, but it's not tailored that way. It pushes you to look beyond dreamy vocals for a musical inner core. Regardless of the band still being in their mid-twenties, they've made an amazing record, and if it ends up being their last, <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i> didn't sugar coat anything. It's a bittersweet design no matter what.</p> — <b> MacKenzie Wilson</b>"

				"review": "<p>After Radiohead stubbornly refused to accept the mantle of world's biggest and most important rock band by releasing the willfully strange rocktronica fusion Kid A in 2000, Coldplay stepped up to the plate with their debut, Parachutes. Tasteful, earnest, introspective, anthemic, and grounded in guitars, the British quartet was everything Radiohead weren't but what the public wanted them to be, and benefited from the Oxford quintet's decision to abandon rock stardom for arcane art rock. Parachutes became was a transatlantic hit and 2002's sequel, A Rush of Blood to the Head, consolidated their success by being bigger and better than Parachutes, positioning Coldplay to not be just the new Radiohead, but the new U2: a band that belongs to the world but whose fans believe that the music is for them alone. To that end, Coldplay's third album, X&Y -- slightly delayed so it follows Rush of Blood by nearly three years, but that's no longer than the time separating OK Computer and Kid A, or The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree -- is designed to be the record that elevates Coldplay to the major leagues, where they are at once the biggest and most important band in the world. It's deliberate and sleek, cinematic and pristine, hip enough to sample Kraftwerk and blend in fashionable retro-'80s post-punk allusions without altering the band's core. Indeed, X&Y is hardly a bold step forward but rather a consolidation of Coldplay's strengths, particularly their skill at crafting surging, widescreen epics. But if X&Y highlights their attributes it also brings Coldplay's weaknesses into sharp relief. Forget the fact that they, by any stretch of the imagination, do not rock -- rocking is simply against their nature. They are a meditative band, reflecting on their emotions instead of letting them go in a cathartic blast of noise and rhythm. This isn't a problem -- after all, there have been plenty of great bands that do not rock & roll -- but their terminal politeness does cripple their music, preventing it from being as majestic as its aspirations. Coldplay is well scrubbed and well behaved, possessing a textbook education in classic rock and the good sense to never stretch any farther than needed. They are the perfect middlebrow rock band -- clean, pristine, and rational, seemingly smart since they never succumb to pounding, primal riffs, but also not weird enough to be genuine art rock. It's ambitious, yet its ambitions are modest, not risky, so their ambitions can be fulfilled without breaking a sweat. And since their sweeping yet subdued theatricality does recall the more majestic moments of Radiohead and U2, they have won millions of fans, but another crucial reason that Coldplay have a broad appeal is that lead singer/songwriter Chris Martin never tackles any large issues, preferring to endlessly examine his feelings. Like on Parachutes and Rush of Blood, all the songs on X&Y are ruminations on Martin's doubts, fears, hopes, and loves. His words are earnest and vague, so listeners can identify with the underlying themes in the songs, and his plain, everyman voice, sighing as sweet as a schoolboy, is unthreatening and unassuming, so it's all the easier for listeners to project their own emotions into the song. But for as impeccable as X&Y is -- and, make no mistake, it's a good record, crisp, professional, and assured, a sonically satisfying sequel to A Rush of Blood to the Head -- it does reveal that Martin's solipsism is a dead-end, diminishing the stature of the band. Where U2 is big in sound, scope, ambition, and intent, Coldplay is ultimately big music about small things, and even if X&Y is a strong, accomplished album, its limited, narcissistic point of view is what prevents the quartet from inheriting the title of the biggest and most important band in the world.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<p>When Coldplay sampled Kraftwerk on their third album, X&Y, it was a signifier for the British band, telegraphing their classicist good taste while signaling how they prefer the eternally hip to the truly adventurous; it was stylish window dressing for soft arena rock. Hiring Brian Eno to produce the bulk of their fourth album, Viva la Vida, is another matter entirely. Eno pushes them, not necessarily to experiment but rather to focus and refine, to not leave their comfort zone but to find some tremulous discomfort within it. In his hands, this most staid of bands looks to shake things up, albeit politely, but such good manners are so inherent to Coldplay's DNA that they remain courteous even when they experiment. With his big-budget production, Eno has a knack for amplifying an artist's personality, as he allows bands to be just as risky as they want to be — which is quite a lot in the case of U2 and James and even Paul Simon, but not quite so much with Coldplay. And yet this gentle encouragement — he's almost a kindly uncle giving his nephews permission to rummage through his study — pays great dividends for Coldplay, as it winds up changing the specifics without altering the core. They wind up with the same self-styled grandiosity; they've just found a more interesting way to get to the same point.</p><p>Gone are Chris Martin's piano recitals and gone are the washes of meticulously majestic guitar, replaced by orchestrations of sound, sometimes literally consisting of strings but usually a tapestry of synthesizers, percussion, organs, electronics, and guitars that avoid playing riffs. Gone too are simpering schoolboy ballads like ~Fix You,~ and along with them the soaring melodies designed to fill arenas. In fact, there are no insistent hooks to be found anywhere on Viva la Vida, and there are no clear singles in this collection of insinuatingly ingratiating songs. This reliance on elliptical melodies isn't off-putting — alienation is alien to Coldplay — and this is where Eno's guidance pays off, as he helps sculpt Viva la Vida to work as a musical whole, where there are long stretches of instrumentals and where only ~Strawberry Swing,~ with its light, gently infectious melody and insistent rhythmic pulse, breaks from the album's appealingly meditative murk. Whatever iciness there is to the sound of Viva la Vida is warmed by Martin's voice, but the music is by design an heir to the earnest British art rock of '80s Peter Gabriel and U2 — arty enough to convey sober intelligence without seeming snobby, the kind of album that deserves to take its title from Frida Kahlo and album art from Eugene Delacroix. That Delacroix painting depicts the French Revolution, so it does fit that Martin tones down his relentless self-obsession — the songs aren't heavy on lyrics and some are shockingly written in character — which is a development as welcome as the expanded sonic palette. Martin's refined writing topics may be outpaced by the band's guided adventure, but they're both indicative that Coldplay are desperate to not just strive for the title of great band — a title they seem to believe that they're to the manor born — but to actually burrow into the explorative work of creating music. And so the greatest thing Coldplay may have learned from Eno is his work ethic, as they demonstrate a focused concentration throughout this tight album — it's only 47 minutes yet covers more ground than X&Y and arguably A Rush of Blood to the Head — that turns Viva la Vida into something quietly satisfying.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"firstname": "John",
		"lastname": "Coltrane",
		"name": "John Coltrane",
		"biography": "<p>Despite a relatively brief career (he first came to notice as a sideman at age 29 in 1955, formally launched a solo career at 33 in 1960, and was dead at 40 in 1967), saxophonist John Coltrane was among the most important, and most controversial, figures in jazz. It seems amazing that his period of greatest activity was so short, not only because he recorded prolifically, but also because, taking advantage of his fame, the record companies that recorded him as a sideman in the 1950s frequently reissued those recordings under his name and there has been a wealth of posthumously released material as well. Since Coltrane was a protean player who changed his style radically over the course of his career, this has made for much confusion in his discography and in appreciations of his playing. There remains a critical divide between the adherents of his earlier, more conventional (if still highly imaginative) work and his later, more experimental work. No one, however, questions Coltrane's almost religious commitment to jazz or doubts his significance in the history of the music.</p> <P>Coltrane was the son of John R. Coltrane, a tailor and amateur musician, and Alice (Blair) Coltrane. Two months after his birth, his maternal grandfather, the Reverend William Blair, was promoted to presiding elder in the A.M.E. Zion Church and moved his family, including his infant grandson, to High Point, NC, where Coltrane grew up. Shortly after he graduated from grammar school in 1939, his father, his grandparents, and his uncle died, leaving him to be raised in a family consisting of his mother, his aunt, and his cousin. His mother worked as a domestic to support the family. The same year, he joined a community band in which he played clarinet and E flat alto horn; he took up the alto saxophone in his high school band. During World War II, his mother, aunt, and cousin moved north to New Jersey to seek work, leaving him with family friends; in 1943, when he graduated from high school, he too headed north, settling in Philadelphia. Eventually, the family was reunited there.</p> <P>While taking jobs outside music, Coltrane briefly attended the Ornstein School of Music and studied at Granoff Studios. He also began playing in local clubs. In 1945, he was drafted into the navy and stationed in Hawaii. He never saw combat, but he continued to play music and, in fact, made his first recording with a quartet of other sailors on July 13, 1946. A performance of Tadd Dameron's ~Hot House,~ it was released in 1993 on the Rhino Records anthology <I>The Last Giant</I>. Coltrane was discharged in the summer of 1946 and returned to Philadelphia. That fall, he began playing inthe Joe Webb Band. In early 1947, he switched to the King Kolax Band. During the year, he switched from alto to tenor saxophone. One account claims that this was as the result of encountering alto saxophonist Charlie Parker and feeling the better-known musician had exhausted the possibilities on the instrument; another says that the switch occurred simply because Coltrane next joined a band led by Eddie ~Cleanhead~ Vinson, who was an alto player, forcing Coltrane to play tenor. He moved on to Jimmy Heath's band in mid-1948, staying with the band, which evolved into the Howard McGhee All Stars until early 1949, when he returned to Philadelphia. That fall, he joined a big band led by Dizzy Gillespie, remaining until the spring of 1951, by which time the band had been trimmed to a septet. On March 1, 1951, he took his first solo on record during a performance of ~We Love to Boogie~ with Gillespie.</p> <P>At some point during this period, Coltrane became a heroin addict, which made him more difficult to employ. He played with various bands, mostly around Philadelphia, during the early '50s, his next important job coming in the spring of 1954, when Johnny Hodges, temporarily out of the <A href=~javascript:z('Be3de4jo70wau')~>Duke Ellington</A> band, hired him. But he was fired because of his addiction in September 1954. He returned to Philadelphia, where he was playing, when he was hired by <A href=~javascript:z('B081gtq7ztu48')~>Miles Davis</A> a year later. His association with Davis was the big break that finally established him as an important jazz musician. Davis, a former drug addict himself, had kicked his habit and gained recognition at the Newport Jazz Festival in July 1955, resulting in a contract with Columbia Records and the opportunity to organize a permanent band, which, in addition to him and Coltrane, consisted of pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer ~Philly~ Joe Jones. This unit immediately began to record extensively, not only because of the Columbia contract, but also because Davis had signed with the major label before fulfilling a deal with jazz independent Prestige Records that still had five albums to run. The trumpeter's Columbia debut, <I>'Round About Midnight</I>, which he immediately commenced recording, did not appear until March 1957. The first fruits of his association with Coltrane came in April 1956 with the release of <I>The New Miles Davis Quintet</I> (aka <I>Miles</I>), recorded for Prestige on November 16, 1955. During 1956, in addition to his recordings for Columbia, Davis held two marathon sessions for Prestige to fulfill his obligation to the label, which released the material over a period of time under the titles <I>Cookin'</I> (1957), <I>Relaxin'</I> (1957), <I>Workin'</I> (1958), and <I>Steamin'</I> (1961).</p> <P>Coltrane's association with Davis inaugurated a period when he began to frequently record as a sideman. Davis may have been trying to end his association Prestige, but Coltrane began appearing on many of the label's sessions. After he became better known in the 1960s, Prestige and other labels began to repackage this work under his name, as if he had been the leader, a process that has continued to the present day. (Prestige was acquired by Fantasy Records in 1972, and many of the recordings in which Coltrane participated have been reissued on Fantasy's Original Jazz Classics [OJC] imprint.)</p> <P>Coltrane tried and failed to kick heroin in the summer of 1956, and in October, Davis fired him, though the trumpeter had relented and taken him back by the end of November. Early in 1957, Coltrane formally signed with Prestige as a solo artist, though he remained in the Davis band and also continued to record as a sideman for other labels. In April, Davis fired him again. This may have given him the impetus finally to kick his drug habit, and freed of the necessity of playing gigs with Davis, he began to record even more frequently. On May 31, 1957, he finally made his recording debut as a leader, putting together a pickup band consisting of trumpeter Johnny Splawn, baritone saxophonist Sahib Shihab, pianists Mal Waldron and Red Garland (on different tracks), bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Al ~Tootie~ Heath. They cut an album Prestige titled simply Coltrane upon release in September 1957. (It has since been reissued under the title <I>First Trane</I>.)</p> <P>In June 1957, Coltrane joined the Thelonious Monk Quartet, consisting of Monk on piano, Wilbur Ware on bass, and <A href=~javascript:z('Bqmxuak1kgm3p')~>Shadow Wilson</A> on drums. During this period, he developed a technique of playing several notes at once, and his solos began to go on longer. In August, he recorded material belatedly released on the Prestige albums <I>Lush Life</I> (1960) and <I>The Last Trane</I> (1965), as well as the material for <I>John Coltrane With the Red Garland Trio</I>, released later in the year. (It was later reissued under the title <I>Traneing In</I>.) But Coltrane's second album to be recorded and released contemporaneously under his name alone was cut in September for Blue Note Records. This was <I>Blue Train</I>, featuring trumpeter Lee Morgan, trombonist Curtis Fuller, pianist Kenny Drew, and the Miles Davis rhythm section of Chambers and ~Philly~ Joe Jones; it was released in December 1957. That month, Coltrane rejoined Davis, playing in what was now a sextet that also featured Cannonball Adderley. In January 1958, he led a recording session for Prestige that produced tracks later released on <I>Lush Life</I>, <I>The Last Trane</I>, and <I>The Believer</I> (1964). In February and March, he recorded Davis' album <I>Milestones...</I>, released later in 1958. In between the sessions, he cut his third album to be released under his name alone, <I>Soultrane</I>, issued in September by Prestige. Also in March 1958, he cut tracks as a leader that would be released later on the Prestige collection <I>Settin' the Pace</I> (1961). In May, he again recorded for Prestige as a leader, though the results would not be heard until the release of <I>Black Pearls</I> in 1964.</p> <P>Coltrane appeared as part of the Miles Davis group at the Newport Jazz Festival in July 1958. The band's set was recorded and released in 1964 on an LP also featuring a performance by <A href=~javascript:z('B369as36ya3xg')~>Thelonious Monk</A> as <I>Miles &amp; Monk at Newport</I>. In 1988, Columbia reissued the material on an album called <I>Miles &amp; Coltrane</I>. The performance inspired a review in Down Beat, the leading jazz magazine, that was an early indication of the differing opinions on Coltrane that would be expressed throughout the rest of his career and long after his death. The review referred to his ~angry tenor,~ which, it said, hampered the solidarity of the Davis band. The review led directly to an article published in the magazine on October 16, 1958, in which critic Ira Gitler defended the saxophonist and coined the much-repeated phrase ~sheets of sound~ to describe his playing.</p><P>Coltrane's next Prestige session as a leader occurred later in July 1958 and resulted in tracks later released on the albums <I>Standard Coltrane</I> (1962), <I>Stardust</I> (1963), and <I>Bahia</I> (1965). All of these tracks were later compiled on a reissue called <I>The Stardust Session</I>. He did a final session for Prestige in December 1958, recording tracks later released on <I>The Believer</I>, <I>Stardust</I>, and <I>Bahia</I>. This completed his commitment to the label, and he signed to Atlantic Records, doing his first recording for his new employers on January 15, 1959, with a session on which he was co-billed with vibes player Milt Jackson, though it did not appear until 1961 with the LP <I>Bags and Trane</I>.</p> <P>In March and April 1959, Coltrane participated with the Davis group on the album <A class=a href=~javascript:z('A3ifrxqegld0e')~><I>Kind of Blue</I></A>. Released on August 17, 1959, this landmark album known for its ~modal~ playing (improvisations based on scales or ~modes,~ rather than chords) became one of the best-selling and most-acclaimed recordings in the history of jazz. In between the sessions for the album, Coltrane began recording what would be his Atlantic Records debut, <A class=a href=~javascript:z('Aktsqoaeayijm')~><I>Giant Steps</I></A>, released in early 1960. The album, consisting entirely of Coltrane compositions, in a sense marked his real debut as a leading jazz performer, even though the 33-year-old musician had released three previous solo albums and made numerous other recordings. His next Atlantic album, <I>Coltrane Jazz</I>, was mostly recorded in November and December 1959 and released in February 1961. In April 1960, he finally left the Davis band and formally launched his solo career, beginning an engagement at the Jazz Gallery in New York, accompanied by pianist Steve Kuhn (soon replaced by McCoy Tyner), bassist Steve Davis, and drummer Pete La Roca (later replaced by Billy Higgins and then Elvin Jones). During this period, he increasingly played soprano saxophone as well as tenor.</p> <P>In October 1960, Coltrane recorded a series of sessions for Atlantic that would produce material for several albums, including a final track used on <I>Coltrane Jazz</I> and tunes used on <A class=a href=~javascript:z('Alk9as36ya3dg')~><I>My Favorite Things</I></A> (March 1961), <I>Coltrane Plays the Blues</I> (July 1962), and <I>Coltrane's Sound</I> (June 1964). His soprano version of ~My Favorite Things,~ from the Richard Rodgers/Oscar Hammerstein II musical The Sound of Music, would become a signature song for him. During the winter of 1960-1961, bassist Reggie Workman replaced Steve Davis in his band and saxophone and flute player Eric Dolphy, gradually became a member of the group.</p><P>In the wake of the commercial success of ~My Favorite Things,~ Coltrane's star rose, and he was signed away from Atlantic as the flagship artist of the newly formed Impulse! Records label, an imprint of ABC-Paramount, though in May he cut a final album for Atlantic, <I>Olé</I> (February 1962). The following month, he completed his Impulse! debut, <I>Africa/Brass</I>. By this time, his playing was frequently in a style alternately dubbed ~avant-garde,~ ~free,~ or ~The New Thing.~ Like Ornette Coleman, he played seemingly formless, extended solos that some listeners found tremendously impressive, and others decried as noise. In November 1961, John Tynan, writing in Down Beat, referred to Coltrane's playing as ~anti-jazz.~ That month, however, Coltrane recorded one of his most celebrated albums, <A class=a href=~javascript:z('Ao6jteau24xh7')~><I>Live at the Village Vanguard</I></A>, an LP paced by the 16-minute improvisation ~Chasin' the Trane.~</p> <P>Between April and June 1962, Coltrane cut his next Impulse! studio album, another release called simply Coltrane when it appeared later in the year. Working with producer Bob Thiele, he began to do extensive studio sessions, far more than Impulse! could profitably release at the time, especially with Prestige and Atlantic still putting out their own archival albums. But the material would serve the label well after the saxophonist's untimely death. Thiele acknowledged that Coltrane's next three Impulse! albums to be released, <I>Ballads</I>, <I>Duke Ellington and John Coltrane</I>, and <I>John Coltrane with Johnny Hartman</I> (all 1963), were recorded at his behest to quiet the critics of Coltrane's more extreme playing. <I>Impressions</I> (1963), drawn from live and studio recordings made in 1962 and 1963, was a more representative effort, as was 1964's <I>Live at Birdland</I>, also a combination of live and studio tracks, despite its title. But <I>Crescent</I>, also released in 1964, seemed to find a middle ground between traditional and free playing, and was welcomed by critics. This trend was continued with 1965's <A class=a href=~javascript:z('A1mkxu3iganxk')~><I>A Love Supreme</I></A>, one of Coltrane's best-loved albums, which earned him two Grammy nominations, for jazz composition and performance, and became his biggest-selling record. Also during the year, Impulse! released the standards collection <I>The John Coltrane Quartet Plays...</I> and another album of ~free~ playing, <I>Ascension</I>, as well as <I>New Thing at Newport</I>, a live album consisting of one side by Coltrane and the other by Archie Shepp.</p>  <P>1966 saw the release of the albums <I>Kulu Se Mama</I> and <I>Meditations</I>, Coltrane's last recordings to appear during his lifetime, though he had finished and approved release for his next album, <I>Expression</I>, the Friday before his death in July 1967. He died suddenly of liver cancer, entering the hospital on a Sunday and expiring in the early morning hours of the next day. He had left behind a considerable body of unreleased work that came out in subsequent years, including <I>~Live~ at the Village Vanguard Again!</I> (1967), <I>Om</I> (1967), <I>Cosmic Music</I> (1968), <I>Selflessness</I> (1969), <I>Transition</I> (1969), <I>Sun Ship</I> (1971), <I>Africa/Brass, Vol. 2</I> (1974), <I>Interstellar Space</I> (1974), and <I>First Meditations (For Quartet)</I> (1977), all on Impulse! Compilations and releases of archival live recordings brought him a series of Grammy nominations, including Best Jazz Performance for the Atlantic album <I>The Coltrane Legacy</I> in 1970; Best Jazz Performance, Group, and Best Jazz Performance, Soloist, for ~Giant Steps~ from the Atlantic album <I>Alternate Takes</I> in 1974; and Best Jazz Performance, Group, and Best Jazz Performance, Soloist, for <I>Afro Blue Impressions</I> in 1977. He won the 1981 Grammy for Best Jazz Performance, Soloist, for <I>Bye Bye Blackbird</I>, an album of recordings made live in Europe in 1962, and he was given the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992, 25 years after his death.</p>  <P>John Coltrane is sometimes described as one of jazz's most influential musicians, but one is hard put to find followers who actually play in his style. Rather, he is influential by example, inspiring musicians to experiment, take chances, and devote themselves to their craft. The controversy about his work has never died down, but partially as a result, his name lives on and his recordings continue to remain available and to be reissued frequently.</p> ",

				"review": "<p>History will undoubtedly enshrine this disc as a watershed the likes of which may never truly be appreciated. Giant Steps bore the double-edged sword of furthering the cause of the music as well as delivering it to an increasingly mainstream audience. Although this was John Coltrane's debut for Atlantic, he was concurrently performing and recording with Miles Davis. Within the space of less than three weeks, Coltrane would complete his work with Davis and company on another genre-defining disc, Kind of Blue, before commencing his efforts on this one. Coltrane (tenor sax) is flanked by essentially two different trios. Recording commenced in early May of 1959 with a pair of sessions that featured Tommy Flanagan (piano) and Art Taylor (drums), as well as Paul Chambers -- who was the only bandmember other than Coltrane to have performed on every date. When recording resumed in December of that year, Wynton Kelly (piano) and Jimmy Cobb (drums) were instated -- replicating the lineup featured on Kind of Blue, sans Miles Davis of course. At the heart of these recordings, however, is the laser-beam focus of Coltrane's tenor solos. All seven pieces issued on the original Giant Steps are likewise Coltrane compositions. He was, in essence, beginning to rewrite the jazz canon with material that would be centered on solos -- the 180-degree antithesis of the art form up to that point. These arrangements would create a place for the solo to become infinitely more compelling. This would culminate in a frenetic performance style that noted jazz journalist Ira Gitler accurately dubbed ~sheets of sound.~ Coltrane's polytonal torrents extricate the amicable and otherwise cordial solos that had begun decaying the very exigency of the genre -- turning it into the equivalent of easy listening. He wastes no time as the disc's title track immediately indicates a progression from which there would be no looking back. Line upon line of highly cerebral improvisation snake between the melody and solos, practically fusing the two. The resolute intensity of ~Countdown~ does more to modernize jazz in 141 seconds than many artists do in their entire careers. Tellingly, the contrasting and ultimately pastoral ~Naima~ was the last tune to be recorded, and is the only track on the original long-player to feature the Kind of Blue quartet. What is lost in tempo is more than recouped in intrinsic melodic beauty. Both Giant Steps [Deluxe Edition] and the seven-disc Heavyweight Champion: The Complete Atlantic Recordings offer more comprehensive presentations of these sessions.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>This 1960 recording was a landmark album in John Coltrane's career, the first to introduce his quartet with pianist McCoy Tyner and drummer Elvin Jones and the first release on which he played soprano saxophone. It also provided him with a signature hit, as his new group conception came together wonderfully on the title track. It's an extended modal reworking in 6/4 time that brought the hypnotic pulsating quality of Indian music into jazz for the first time, with Coltrane's soprano wailing over the oscillating piano chords and pulsing drums. The unusual up-tempo version of Gershwin's ~Summertime~is a heated example of Coltrane's ~sheets of sound~ approach to conventional changes, while ~But Not for Me~ receives a radical harmonic makeover. This is an excellent introduction to Coltrane's work.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stuart Broomer - Spotlight Reviews</strong></p><p>Although seemingly impossible to comprehend, this landmark jazz recording was made in less than three days. All the more remarkable is that the same sessions which yielded <em>My Favorite Things</em> would also inform a majority of the albums <em>Coltrane Plays the Blues</em>, <em>Coltrane's Sound</em>, and <em>Coltrane Legacy</em>. It is easy to understand the appeal that these sides continue to hold. The unforced, practically casual soloing styles of the assembled quartet — which includes Coltrane (soprano/tenor sax), McCoy Tyner (piano), Steve Davis (bass), and Elvin Jones (drums) — allow for tastefully executed passages à la the Miles Davis Quintet, a trait Coltrane no doubt honed during his tenure in that band. Each track of this album is a joy to revisit. The ultimate listenability may reside in this quartet's capacity to not be overwhelmed by the soloist. Likewise, they are able to push the grooves along surreptitiously and unfettered. For instance, the support that the trio — most notably Tyner — gives to Coltrane on the title track winds the melody in and around itself. However, instead of becoming entangled and directionless, these musicalsidebars simultaneously define the direction the song is taking. Asa soloist, the definitive soprano sax runs during the Cole Porter standard ~Everytime We Say Goodbye~ and tenor solos on ~But Not for Me~easily establish Coltrane as a pioneer of both instruments.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

Focusing on 'Trane's influential Atlantic output of the late '50s and early '60s, this CD shouldn't be confused with previous Best of John Coltrane collections from Pablo/Fantasy (Pablo 2405-417) or Atlantic (Atlantic 1541), although everything Atlantic chose for the latter can also be found on this collection, including ~My Favorite Things,~ ~Equinox,~ ~Giant Steps,~ ~Naima,~ ~Cousin Mary,~ and ~Central Park West.~ This CD, however, is more generous and also includes such gems as ~Summertime~ from My Favorite Things, ~Mr. Syms~ from Coltrane Sings the Blues, ~My Shining Hour~ from Coltrane Jazz, and ~Body and Soul~ from Coltrane's Sound. Seasoned Coltrane fans will already be familiar with these essential 1959 and 1960 recordings, so the person that Rhino obviously had in mind when it released this disc was the casual listener. All of Coltrane's Atlantic output is worth owning, and most of it is truly essential. But for those who have yet to experience the joys of Coltrane's Atlantic period and need a course in Introductory Coltrane 101, this CD would be a very rewarding and logical starting point.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Alex Henderson</strong></p>"

Recorded over two days in December 1964, Trane's classic quartet--Elvin Jones, McCoy Tyner, and Jimmy Garrison-- stepped into the studio and created one of the most the most thought-provoking, concise, and technically pleasing albums of their bountiful relationship. From the undulatory (and classic) bassline at the intro to the last breathy notes, Trane is at the peak of his logical and emotionally varied soloing, while the rest of the group is completely atttuned to his spiritual vibe. Composed of four parts, each has a thematic progression. ~Acknowledgement~ is the awakening to a spiritual life from the darkness of the world; it trails off with the saxophonist chanting the suite's title. ~Resolution~ is an amazingly beautiful, somewhat turbulent segment. It portrays the dedication required for discovery on the path toward spiritual understanding. ~Pursuance~ searches deeply for that experience, while ~Psalm~ portrays that discovery and the realization of enlightenment with humility. Although sometimes aggressive and dissonant, this isn't Coltrane at his most furious or adventurous. His recordings following this period--studio and live-- become progressively untethered and extremely spirited. A Love Supreme not only attempts but realizes the ambitious undertaking of Coltrane's concept; his emotional, searching, sometimes prayerful journey is made abundantly clear. Clocking in at 33 minutes; A Love Supreme conveys much without overstatement. It is almost impossible to imagine any jazz collection without it.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Sam Samuelson</strong></p>"

This 1998 single CD has the five performances that the great saxophonist had agreed to have released during his lifetime: three numbers from the original Live at the Village Vanguard LP (~Spiritual,~ ~Softly as in a Morning Sunrise,~ and ~Chasin' the Trane~) and two songs that appeared on Impressions (the title cut and ~India~). Although branded as ~anti-jazz~ by John S. Wilson (an attack that was seconded by Leonard Feather), the music is actually quite coherent and would even be thought of as moderately conservative today, particularly ~Spiritual~ and the boppish rendition of ~Softly.~ Coltrane does stretch out quite a bit on the raging ~Chasin' the Trane~ and ~Impressions,~ but compared to what he would be playing in 1965, this should not scare anyone away. Obviously this CD (which also has Eric Dolphy's bass clarinet on two songs, pianist McCoy Tyner, Reggie Workman and/or Jimmy Garrison on bass, and drummer Elvin Jones) is primarily recommended to listeners not wanting to invest in the more complete box.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Scott Yanow</strong></p><hr/><p>Original album review</p><p>This set documents the four-night stand by John Coltrane (sax) and his quintet at the Village Vanguard in New York City, November 1 -- 5, 1961. Although these are not newly discovered tapes -- as the majority of the selections have turned up on no less than five separate releases -- their restoration is significant in assessing motifs in Coltrane's [read: multi-show] live appearances. Coltrane is accompanied by an all-star ensemble of Eric Dolphy (alto sax/bass clarinet), Garvin Bushell (oboe/contrabassoon), Ahmed Abdul-Malik (oud), McCoy Tyner (piano), Jimmy Garrison (bass), Reggie Workman (bass), Elvin Jones (drums), and Roy Haynes (drums). Their presence is as equally vital as Coltrane's -- inspiring as well as informing the dimensions of improvisation. With the knowledge that the entire run was being documented to create some sort of retail document, Coltrane chose nine specific compositions to concentrate on. The choice of material likewise had a tremendous impact on the personnel of the band -- evidenced by Bushnell's contributions during ~Spiritual~ and Abdul-Malik's within the context of the extended ~India.~ Each set bears its own distinctive shading and emphasis. Parties wishing to hear the run in its entirety are encouraged to check out the multi-disc Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings (1997) as there are multiple takes of the same songs. This allows even the most unsophisticated jazz consumer the opportunity to note the difference in the various versions, while contrasting the player's widely diverse performance styles. The highly recommended box set also includes a nine-panel fold out poster, 48-page liner notes booklet -- with a complete discography for the included material -- and other ephemera, such as rarely published photographs.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

The job must have seemed pretty easy since just about everything he recorded for the label could be considered in the spiritual order. The real problem, therefore, became deciding which pieces to leave off the compilation as opposed to which ones to include. For instance, ~Acknowledgement,~ the first movement from the landmark <em>A Love Supreme</em> is in tow, but taken out of context it feels secluded and unsupported, thereby relegating the rest of <em>A Love Supreme</em> (which is arguably even more spirited) inconsequential. There are certainly some beautiful works here: ~Song of Praise~ (an odd, but delightful choice), and ~Dear Lord~ typify this compilation -- in fact there's not a dud in the group. It's just not possible to capture or do justice to Trane's spiritually themed Impulse! output onto one disc. For the seasoned Coltrane fan this compilation will prove useless. For those beginning their journey into Coltrane's formidable catalog, <em>Spiritual</em> is a mediocre representation of some magnificent records.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jack Isles</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>John Coltrane spent little more than a decade of his career in the public eye before his death in 1967, but during that time his work was in a state of constant, often turbulent change. In the process, he would create one of the most influential bodies of work in jazz. Many of Coltrane's greatest recordings were long, and it's no easy task to create a single CD that reflects his creative range. However, this remarkably good selection manages to include several extended performances, while charting his work's moments of both profound meditative beauty and creative onslaught. On ~Giant Steps,~ Coltrane pressed the boundaries of chordal improvisation, creating a high-speed maze of harmonic extensions. In perhaps his most famous vehicle, he recrafted ~My Favorite Things~ in the image of Indian music, spinning scalar improvisations on his soprano saxophone over a repeating piano figure and the molten drums of Elvin Jones. ~Chasin' the Trane,~ from his great 1961 Village Vanguard recordings, uses simple blues to launch an extended solo that tests the tenor's expressive limits. ~Jupiter,~ a duet with drummer Rashied Ali recorded in the final months of Coltrane's life, finds the same intensity still burning within him, his tone compressed to a tight vibrato and his circular lines spinning in still fresh directions. Along the way are those serene islands that always marked Coltrane's work, some of the most beautiful and direct ballad and blues playing in jazz, from his own ~Naima~ to an ethereal version of ~In a Sentimental Mood~ with its composer, Duke Ellington, at the piano.</p> &mdash; <b>Stuart Broomer</b>"

		"biography": "<div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/rc-paris.jpg~ alt=~Paris Texas~><p>Whether serving as a session musician, solo artist, or soundtrack composer, Ry Cooder's chameleon-like fretted instrument virtuosity, songwriting, and choice of material encompass an incredibly eclectic range of North American musical styles, including rock & roll, blues, reggae, Tex-Mex, Hawaiian, Dixieland jazz, country, folk, R&B, gospel, and vaudeville. In addition to his American music bona fides, Cooder is an unofficial American cultural ambassador: He was partially responsible for bringing together the Cuban musicians known globally as the Buena Vista Social Club, recording with Ali Farka Toure, Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, and Manuel Galban, to name scant few. During the '80s and '90s he was a celebrated film composer, scoring works such as Walter Hill's The Long Riders, Wim Wenders' Paris, Texas and The End of Violence, and Tony Richardson's The Border. Since 1989, he has won six Grammy Awards and been nominated for many more in genres ranging from children's music and folk, to Latin (pop and traditional), Americana, and world music. Among his most notable albums in the 21st century were the conceptual albums Chavez Ravine, about an LA neighborhood bulldozed to make way for bringing the Dodgers baseball team to Los Angeles, and San Patricio with the Chieftains, about a band of immigrant Irish soldiers that deserted the American Army during the Mexican-American War to fight for the other side.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/rc-beefhart.jpg~ alt=~Captain Beefhart - Safe As Milk~><p>The 16-year-old Cooder began his career in 1963 in a blues band with Jackie DeShannon and then formed the short-lived Rising Sons in 1965 with Taj Mahal and Spirit drummer Ed Cassidy. Cooder met producer Terry Melcher through the Rising Sons and was invited to perform at several sessions with Paul Revere & the Raiders. During his subsequent career as a session musician, Cooder's trademark slide guitar work graced the recordings of such artists as Captain Beefheart (Safe as Milk), Randy Newman, Little Feat, Van Dyke Parks, the Rolling Stones (Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers), Taj Mahal, and Gordon Lightfoot. He also appeared on the soundtracks of Candy and Performance.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/rc-purple.jpg~ alt=~Into The Purple Valley~><p>Cooder made his debut as a solo artist in 1970 with a self-titled album featuring songs by Leadbelly, Blind Willie Johnson, Sleepy John Estes, and Woody Guthrie. The follow-up, Into the Purple Valley, introduced longtime cohorts Jim Keltner on drums and Jim Dickinson on bass, and it and Boomer's Story largely repeated and refined the syncopated style and mood of the first. In 1974, Cooder produced what is generally regarded as his best album, Paradise and Lunch, and its follow-up, Chicken Skin Music, showcased a potent blend of Tex-Mex, Hawaiian, gospel, and soul, and featured contributions from Flaco Jimenez and Gabby Pahinui. In 1979, Bop til You Drop was the first major-label album to be recorded digitally. In the early '80s, Cooder began to augment his solo output with soundtrack work on such films as Blue Collar, The Long Riders, and The Border; he has gone on to compose music for films such as Paris, Texas, Streets of Fire, Alamo Bay, Blue City, Crossroads, Cocktail, Johnny Handsome, and Steel Magnolias, among others. Music by Ry Cooder (1995) compiled two discs' worth of highlights from Cooder's film work.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/rc-bring.jpg~ alt=~John Hiatt - Bring The Family~><p>In 1992, Cooder joined Keltner, John Hiatt, and renowned British tunesmith Nick Lowe, all of whom had played on Hiatt's Bring the Family, to form Little Village, which toured and recorded one album. Cooder turned his attention to world music, recording the album A Meeting by the River with Indian musician V.M. Bhatt. Cooder's next project, a duet album with renowned African guitarist Ali Farka Touré titled Talking Timbuktu, won the 1994 Grammy for Best World Music Recording.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/rc-buena.jpg~ alt=~Buena Vista Social Club~><p>His next world crossover would become one of the most popular musical rediscoveries of the 20th century. In 1997, Cooder traveled to Cuba to produce and play with a group of son musicians who had little exposure outside of their homeland. The resulting album, Buena Vista Social Club, was a platinum-selling international success that made stars of Compay Segundo, Ibrahim Ferrer, and Rubén González, and earned Cooder another Grammy. He continued to work on projects with his Buena Vista bandmates, including a collaboration with Manuel Galbán in 2003 titled Mambo Sinuendo. His other work in the 2000s included sessions with James Taylor, Aaron Neville, Warren Zevon, and Spanish diva Luz Casal.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/rc-rhythm.jpg~ alt=~Get Rhythm~><p>In 2005, Cooder released Chavez Ravine, his first solo album since 1987's Get Rhythm; the album was the first entry in a trilogy of recordings about the disappearance of Los Angeles' cultural history as a result of gentrification. Chavez Ravine was followed by My Name Is Buddy in 2007, and the final chapter in the saga I, Flathead in 2009. In 2010, Cooder was approached by Paddy Moloney of the Chieftains to produce an album. Moloney had been obsessed with an historical account of the San Patricios, a band of immigrant Irish soldiers who deserted the American Army during the Mexican-American War in 1846 to fight for the other side, against the Manifest Destiny ideology of James Polk's America. Cooder agreed and the result was San Patricio, which brings this fascinatingly complex tale to life. In early 2011, Cooder was taken by a headline about bankers and other moneyed citizens who'd actually profited from the bank bailouts and resulting mortgage and economic crisis, and wrote the song ~No Banker Left Behind,~ which became the first song on 2011's Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, an album that reached all the way back to his earliest recordings for musical inspiration while telling topical stories about corruption -- political and social -- the erasure and the rewriting of American history, and an emerging class war. A month after its release, Beat poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti's fabled City Lights publishing house issued Cooder's first collection of short fiction entitled Los Angeles Stories. He continued to follow his socio-political muse with Election Special, released in the summer of 2012, and in 2013 released Live in San Francisco, his first live album in 35 years, with Corridos Famosos (son Joachim on percussion, Flaco Jimenez on accordion, Robert Francis on bass, and vocalists Terry Evans, Arnold McCuller, and Juliette Commagere). The ten-piece Mexican brass band La Banda Juvenil also guested. In 2014, Rhino Records offered an epic-scale look at Cooder's work in film scoring with Soundtracks, a seven-disc box set compiled from his movie music of the '80s and '90s.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/rc-prodigal.jpg~ alt=~Prodigal Son~><p>After playing mainly bluegrass and country gospel songs with Ricky Skaggs in 2017, Cooder's percussionist son Joachim convinced his dad to cut an album of country and blues-gospel songs. The younger Cooder arranged the 11-song set and the guitarist fleshed them out for a band. Entitled The Prodigal Son, it comprising eight covers including songs by the Pilgrim Travelers, Blind Willie Johnson, Carter Stanley, and three originals. In late March, Cooder released a preview video of an arrangement of the title track recorded live in studio. The Prodigal Son was issued in May 2018 and followed by his first American tour in 15 years; he was backed by his own band (with Joachim on drums and percussion) with backing vocals by the Hamiltones. </p><p>&mdash;<strong>Steve Huey</strong></p>",

Released the following year, Cooder's eponymous debut creates an intriguing fusion of blues, folk, rock & roll, and pop, filtered through his own intricate, syncopated guitar; Van Dyke Parks and Lenny Waronker's idiosyncratic production; and Parks and Kirby Johnson's string arrangements. And while he's still finding his feet as a singer, Cooder puts this unique blend across with a combination of terrific songs, virtuosic playing, and quirky, yet imaginative, arrangements. For material, Cooder, the son of folklorist parents, unearths ten gems -- spanning six decades dating back to the 1920s -- by legends such as Woody Guthrie, Blind Blake, Sleepy John Estes, and Leadbelly, as well as a current Randy Newman composition. Still, as great as his outside choices are, it's the exuberant charm of his own instrumental ~Available Space~ that nearly steals the show. Its joyful interplay between Cooder's slide, Van Dyke Parks' music hall piano, and the street-corner drumming creates a piece that is both loose and sophisticated. If ~Available Space~ is the record's most playful moment, its closer, ~Dark Is the Night,~ is the converse, with Cooder's stark, acoustic slide extracting every ounce of torment from Blind Willie Johnson's mournful masterpiece. Some of the eccentric arrangements may prove to be a bit much for both purists and pop audiences alike, but still, Cooder's need to stretch, tempered with a reverence for the past, helps to create a completely original work that should reward adventurous listeners.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

Cooder adds the traditional title-track, which opens the album, and Lawrence Wilson's ~Crow Black Chicken,~ which dates back to the late 1920s, to this collection of discoveries -- both of which are handled with just the right balance of personality and reverence. Elsewhere, he injects a dark irony into the jingoistic ~Rally 'Round the Flag,~ with its slow, mournful piano (played by Randy Newman) and slide guitar, while the Joseph Spence-style guitar arrangement of the World War II standard ~Comin' in on a Wing and a Prayer~ has a sense of hope and conviction. Often criticized for possessing a less than commanding voice, Cooder steps back from the microphone for four of the album's ten tracks -- three instrumentals and one featuring Sleepy John Estes on his own ~President Kennedy.~ And while all of the instrumentals presented here are fine renditions of great tunes, it's ~Dark End of the Street~ which truly stands out. Here, Cooder realizes that the only thing in his arsenal that can do justice to James Carr's definitive version is his own remorseful slide guitar. Without uttering a single lyric, he's able to convey the shame and deep regret of the Dan Penn/Chips Moman classic. Thanks to moments like this, along with Cooder's consistently strong choice of material and brilliant guitar work, Boomer's Story -- less eccentric than his first, and less eclectic than Into the Purple Valley -- ranks among his best work</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

The album closes with its most stripped-down track, an acoustic guitar and piano duet with jazz legend Earl ~Fatha~ Hines on the Blind Blake classic ~Ditty Wah Ditty.~ Here both musicians are given plenty of room to showcase their instrumental prowess, and the results are nothing short of stunning.

				"review": "<p>Following the odd, but entertaining Hawaiian, southwestern mix of Chicken Skin Music, Ry Cooder hit the road with a group of Tex-Mex musicians led by the great accordionist Flaco Jiminez. To make things even more interesting, he also included three soul- and gospel-based backup singers in the lineup (two of whom had appeared on Chicken Skin Music). Recorded in December of 1976, over a span of two nights in San Francisco, Show Time documents these shows by Cooder and his ~Chicken Skin Revue.~ And while Cooder's guitar -- along with his usual eclectic assortment of songs -- is the star of the show, each of the principles has his chance to shine throughout the evening. Terry Evans, Bobby King, and Eldridge King's soulful rendition of ~The Dark End of the Street,~ as well as the lovely ~Volver, Volver,~ which features Jiminez, are a couple of the highlights. Cooder's selection of material here is as eclectic as ever, but Jiminez and the band stay with him every step of the way. They seem equally at home with the R&B of ~Smack Dab in the Middle~ as they do with the Jiminez instrumental ~Viva Seguin,~ which leads into a Tex-Mex reworking of Woody Guthrie's ~Do Re Mi.~ Still, as good as the fit may be between leader and band, it's the Negro spiritual, ~Jesus on the Mainline,~ stripped down to just four voices and Cooder's remarkable bottleneck, that's the real showstopper here. Cooder is not usually one to stray too far outside the confines of the song on record, but in this setting he gets a chance to really stretch. Like most live recordings, Show Time isn't necessarily essential, though there's enough to make it worthwhile for fans. Also, included is a terrific Dixieland take on Gary ~U.S.~ Bonds' ~School Is Out~ recorded with the same band in the studio.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Beginning with his self-titled debut in 1970, Ry Cooder's records seemed to be as much history lesson as they were entertainment. Not because Cooder was trying to club you over the head with this stuff; he simply gravitated to great songs, no matter what the era or genre. Released in 1978, Jazz seems to be his first conscious attempt at a concept album, in the historical sense. Here he pays homage to some of the early tunes and masters of jazz, ranging from the late 1800s through the ~coon songs~ of the early part of the next century, to the ragtime and ~Spanish~ music of Jelly Roll Morton, and the sophistication of cornetist Bix Beiderbecke. The only living artist (at the time of release) who's represented here is the great Bahamian guitarist Joseph Spence, who recorded from the '50s through the '80s, and whose syncopated style was extremely influential in Cooder's own development as a guitarist. Spence's sacred songs are presented here in string and brass band arrangements that emphasize the Caribbean connection between his music and Morton's habaniera pieces. The complexity of the material on Jazz, as well as the arrangements by Joseph Byrd, dictate that this is Cooder's most polished and orchestrated effort to date. Whereas in the past, even at their most removed, Cooder's records usually kept at least one foot in rock & roll or blues, Jazz can, at times, lack some of that fire and be almost bookish in its approach. Still, there is enough excitement in the music's intricacies and Cooder's beautiful, fluid playing to forgive the politeness of some of the performances. From the informative liner notes by Ry Cooder himself to the brilliant compositions, Jazz is, at the very least, educational. But, a little time spent with this music and you'll see why it was and continues to be relevant, as well as beloved.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

At the same time, he also continues the primarily electric sound of that record. As far as his selection of material goes, Borderline may sometimes lack the surprising, esoteric charm of his earlier recordings, but there are still some terrific finds, including the Tex-Mex-flavored ~The Girls from Texas,~ which may be the album's finest moment. Other highlights include one of John Hiatt's best, the written-to-order ~The Way We Make a Broken Heart,~ as well as Billy ~The Kid~ Emerson's ~Crazy 'Bout an Automobile,~ which Cooder had been performing live for a number of years, and the soulful Maurice & Mac treasure ~Why Don't You Try Me.~ And while it's moments like these that help make Cooder's records special, he also takes on some better-known '50s and '60s offerings with moderate success. His recording of Wilson Pickett's 1966 hit ~634-5789~ isn't going to make anyone forget the original, but he's able to pull it off as a rocker, while ~Speedo~ and ~Down in the Boondocks~ are respectable covers. Borderline may not have the singular personality of his best '70s work, but it's a solid outing nonetheless.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

The Border, composed and released in 1982, was the soundtrack to Tony Richardson's film The Border, and 1985's Alamo Bay was directed by Louis Malle. The interesting thing about these soundtracks is that they come immediately after Cooder's successful collaboration with Walter Hill on The Long Riders and Southern Comfort, and as the before-and-after bookends to his enigmatic score for Wim Wenders' Paris, Texas. The score for The Border is perfectly balanced. Cooder's slide work is always touted, but also noteworthy is his ability to virtually disappear in the mix when collaborating with Flaco Jimenez, Freddy Fender, Jim Dickinson, Jim Keltner, and Sam ~The Sham~ Samudio. The haunting title track, ~Across the Borderline,~ sung by Fender, is among the most beautiful and literate cuts Cooder has ever written. The cantina music by Jimenez and Samudio is utterly evocative. Check the tunes with Samudio on vocals, such as ~Palomita~ and ~No Quiero,~ to get the laid-back, sun-up feel. Then there's John Hiatt. Hiatt was at the beginning of his association with Cooder. He helped to pen some of the better cuts on the set, including the aforementioned ~Across the Borderline~ and the bluesy garage rock jam ~Skin Game.~ His high-whine vocals are perfect for the tension between cultures and reflect the conflict of Jack Nicholson's character as a principled U.S. border guard. Alamo Bay, Malle's picture that pits American shrimpers against refugee Vietnamese on the south coast of Texas, is another study in contrasts. Once more, Cooder assembles an all-star band that includes Hiatt, Cesar Rosas, David Hidalgo, Lee Ving, Van Dyke Parks, David Lindley, Keltner, Chris Ethridge, David Mansfield, and Dickinson. The theme features Cooder's acoustic slide amidst strings (including Gayle Levant's harp), piano, and ambient sounds. The ethereal airy feel is swallowed whole by the raunchy electric roadhouse blues of ~Gooks on Main Street,~ and dislocated once more on the country ballad ~Too Close,~ performed by Hiatt with actress Amy Madigan, only to shift again with the sinister slide guitar and harmonica Eastern modal blues of ~Klan Meeting,~ an instrumental. The score weaves and wends through barroom shouters, panoramic instrumentals, ballads, Tex Mex, and conjunto. Placing both recordings on a single disc is a rare and exotic treat, and gives great insight into the complex yet visionary artist Cooder is, and just how his music is the perfect accompaniment to visuals yet stands completely on its own.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

The two gems on this are the phenomenal treatments of both ~Blue Suede Shoes~ and Bob Dylan's ~I Need a Woman.~ Two songs as different in the original forms as pigs and gerbils are converted to R&B hit status. Both contain some memorable slide guitar work, but isn't that what we expect from this master of the guitar family.

				"review": "Suggestive of both the imagery of Wim Wenders' movie Paris, Texas and the desert itself, Ry Cooder's score is a peaceful, poetic journey into the soul of an acoustic guitar. ~Paris, Texas,~ ~Brothers,~ and ~Nothing Out There~ open the album as meditative blends of guitar twang and scratching ambient effects. The songs move at a pretty, slow place, and the opening track sees Cooder plucking his guitar's strings and letting that sound vibrate into thin air; it's a motif that he returns to repeatedly throughout the score. There's a bit of both humor and mystery to the stillness and the echoing, edgy sound effects that crop up. ~Cancion Mixteca~ includes a memorable turn on vocals by Harry Dean Stanton, singing in Spanish. ~No Safety Zone~ is almost completely ambient in its ethics, with fleeting experimental guitar playing, as the song works more as a mood-setter than a traditional song. ~I Knew These People~ begins with an extended segment of dialogue from the film before Cooder's somber guitar creeps in. The effect of the dialogue makes the track a fine, artistic statement, but the moment works better in the context of the movie than as a track on an album. The dialogue comes from a scene where the characters played by Stanton and Nastassja Kinski have a particularly emotional meeting. The majority of the score is delicate and stunningly pretty. The overall sense is that Cooder was reaching for spare, emotional movements. The score is stark, quiet, and as uplifting as it is sad. Cooder makes the music sound as modern and stylish as acoustic music can sound. The album is at once alien and organic. Since ~I Knew These People~ includes dialogue from Paris, Texas, the score works best for people who have seen the movie, but it's still a powerful and immensely evocative journey for those whose experience with the material is the album alone.<p>&mdash;<strong>Tim DiGravina</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>A Meeting by the River can best be described as a spontaneous outpouring of music, unhindered by convention or form, brought into being by musicians so supremely capable that the music is never labored, the technique of their craft always subservient to the final product. Cooder and Bhatt are genuine masters of the guitar and mohan vina, respectively. The latter, an instrument created by Bhatt himself, is a sort of hybrid between a guitar and a vichitra vina, and is played with a metal slide. This fact is just one of the many things that connect Bhatt's playing to Cooder's, who plays nothing but bottleneck guitar here. The musical interplay between Cooder and Bhatt is nothing short of astounding, especially so considering that they met for the first time only a half-hour before the recording of this album. The voices of the two instruments blend marvelously, first alternating melodic statements, then doing so together, each dancing around the other, playing cat and mouse, probing, answering, reflecting. They are ably accompanied by a pair of percussionists: tabla player Sukhvinder Singh Namdhari and Cooder's own son, Joachim, on dumbek. A Meeting by the River is one of those few cross-genre albums in which the listener never feels for a second that there is some kind of fusion going on; one does not hear the component parts so much as the integrated whole. However, one can theoretically separate guitar from vina, America from India, the Mississippi from the Ganges. Once this is done, the resulting music makes more sense than ever before, the combination of two traditions of stringed instruments that use slides to produce sound and value improvisation and voice-like phrasing. As good as this sounds on paper, the actual results are even more impressive. The splendor of the music is aided in its transmission by the fact that, like all Water Lily Acoustics releases, this album is masterfully recorded; each instrument is clear, distinct, and three-dimensional sounding. A Meeting by the River is a must-own, a thing of pure, unadulterated beauty, and the strongest record in Cooder's extensive catalog.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Daniel Gioffre</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>This album is named after a members-only club that was opened in Havana in pre-Castro times, a period of unbelievable musical activity in Cuba. While bandleader Desi Arnaz became a huge hit in the States, several equally talented musicians never saw success outside their native country, and have had nothing but their music to sustain them during the Castro reign. Ry Cooder went to Cuba to record a musical documentary of these performers. Many of the musicians on this album have been playing for more than a half century, and they sing and play with an obvious love for the material. Cooder could have recorded these songs without paying the musicians a cent; one can imagine them jumping up and grabbing for their instruments at the slightest opportunity, just to play. Most of the songs are a real treasure, traversing a lot of ground in Cuba's musical history. There's the opening tune, ~Chan Chan,~ a composition by 89-year-old Compay Segundo, who was a bandleader in the '50s; the cover of the early-'50s tune ~De Camino a la Verada,~ sung by the 72-year-old composer Ibrahim Ferrer, who interrupted his daily walk through Havana just long enough to record; or the amazing piano playing on ~Pablo Nuevo~ by 77-year-old Rubén González, who has a unique style that blends jazz, mambo, and a certain amount of playfulness. All of these songs were recorded live -- some of them in the musicians' small apartments -- and the sound is incredibly deep and rich, something that would have been lost in digital recording and overdubbing. Cooder brought just the right amount of reverence to this material, and it shows in his production, playing, and detailed liner notes. If you get one album of Cuban music, this should be the one.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Steve McMullen</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Three years in the making, <i>Chavez Ravine: A Record by Ry Cooder</i>, is his first ~solo~ offering since 1987's <i>Get Rhythm</i>. In addition, it is a concept album; but don't be afraid. It documents in mythical style the disappeared Los Angeles neighborhood of Chavez Ravine, a Mexican-American district that fought over by real etate developers, urban planning activists and city government. It was bulldozed in a sleazy deal was cut and it was razed order to erect a stadium that woiuld lure Walter O'Malley's Brooklyn Dodgers to L.A. Cooder's work has almost always concerned itself with what has been left out, marginalized, or relegated to the place of memory; it was inspired by a book of black-and-white photographs of the area by Don Normark. Over the course of its 15 songs Cooder poignantly, yet warmly, sets out to portray the flavor of the place, times, culture, chaos, and corruption of post-war Los Angeles. Here UFOs, the Red Scare, the Pachuco Scare, boxers, cops, hipster ~cool cats,~ ordinary folks, race politics, class war, the radio, J. Edgar Hoover, baseball, and of course musicians, slip in and out of this steamy, dreamy, seamless mix that evokes an emotional palette rich and complex. The tunes range from boxy corridos, Latin swing numbers, guaraches, Afro-Cuban sons, smoky polkas, moody atmospheric pieces, riotous good-time Pachuco boogie, rootsy rock, Costa Rican folk songs, and R&B tunes.</p> <p>Heroes and villains come and go in this panorama, all winding around in the little neighborhood where people hang out, sing, dance, make love, struggle and sweat for a better life in the American Dream. Sung in Spanish and English, Cooder sought out musicians from the era and the place, including the late Pachuco boogie boss Don Tosti, the late legendary Lalo Guerrero (the guiding force and spirit of the album who also passed away after contributing), Ersi Arvizu, and Little Willie G., all of whom appear with Joachim Cooder, Juliette & Carla Commagere, Jim Keltner, Flaco Jimenez, Mike Elizondo, Gil Bernal, Ledward Kaapana, Joe Rotunde, Rosella Arvizu, and others. ~Poor Man's Shangri-La,~ is a finger-popping rhumba where the extraterrestrial Space Vato beams down in a UFO to check out the 'hood to the sounds of Little Julian Herrera on the radio. Little Willie G. and the Commagere Sisters offer the lilting ~Onda Calljera,~ a folk song documenting a war between locally stationed military and pachucos. Chavez Ravine is an intricately woven web of covers including ~3 Cool Cats,~ by Leiber & Stoller, Guerrero's ~Corrido de Boxeo~ and ~Barrio Viejo,~ and originals like the cinematic ~Don't Call Me Red~ (where the taped voices of Frank Wilkinson, Jack Webb, and Raymond Burr all dialogue intensely about the FBI and communist activities) and ~3rd Base, Dodger Stadium,~ sung by longtime Cooder mate James Bla Pahinui -- who plays the part of a stadium car parker whose home was covered over by the hot corner in the ballpark. Chavez Ravine is sad and beautiful, funny, quirky and funky; it's got dirt under its nails and keeps listeners engaged from the jump with history and its colorful ghosts. Cooder sends it all off with solace, and perhaps with some hope, in a version of ~Soy Luz y Sombra,~ a gorgeous a cappella Costa Rican folk tune with original music. Chavez Ravine is easily the most ambitious thing in Cooder's catalog, and it just may be the grand opus of his career.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

				"review": "<p>Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, issued between two national election cycles, is the most overtly political album Ry Cooder has ever released, and one of his funniest, most musically compelling ones, too. Cooder looks deeply into his musical past using his entire Americana musical arsenal: blues, folk, ragtime, norteño, rock, and country here. Opener ~No Banker Left Behind~ updates Civil War-era marching music. Cooder's guitar, banjo, bass, and mandola lead drummer (and son) Joachim through a scathing indictment of the the financial bailout in 2007. The marching rhythms are punched through with sharp banjo and mandola riffs as Cooder's signature electric guitar sound frames them. ~El Corrido Jesse James~ has the outlaw speaking from heaven in waltz time. Accompanied by Flaco Jimenez's accordion and a horn section, James claims that while he was a bank robber, he never ~turned a family from their house,~ and asks God for his trusty .44 to ~put that bonus money back where it belongs.~ ~Quick Sand~ is a shuffling electric rocker that addresses the plight of illegal immigrants crossing into Arizona. ~Christmas Time This Year~ is the most incendiary anti-war song in a decade, presented innocently as a Mexican polka. ~Lord Tell Me Why~ borrows production techniques from Tom Waits, with co-writer and drummer Jim Keltner who assists in getting across this biting, ironic gospel tune: ~Lord tell me why a white man/Ain't worth nothin' in this world no more....~ An 11-piece band assists in ~I Want My Crown,~ a scorching, growling blues with Cooder's nasty guitar leading the charge. It's followed by the album's finest moment, ~John Lee Hooker for President,~ where Cooder does a shockingly accurate impression of the late bluesman, in fine boogie mode, paying a visit to the White House, not liking what he sees, and deciding to run for office: ~I'm compastatic. I ain't Republican or Democratic.~ He names Jimmy Reed as Veep and Johnny Taylor Secretary of State. His campaign promises swift retribution for injustice and a ~groove time~ for the nation. If only. The depth of Cooder's rage is quieter but more direct as the album draws to a close. In ~If There Is a God,~ God's been driven from heaven by redistricting; he, ~Jesus, Mary and Joe~ all hit the road for Mexico. God goes so far as to say he thinks the ~Republiklan~ legislature wants to bring back Jim Crow laws. Cooder's sorrow about the environment is pervasive in the final corrido, though he, like the Buddha, leaves room for tolerance, wishing his enemies ~No Hard Feelings.~ Those who've followed Cooder from the beginning will find much to love on Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down. Those music fans unfamiliar with his work but looking for a comrade in arms will find one here. That said, this is revolution music; worthy of dancing to, learning from, and singing along with: who says topical music has to be boring?</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"name": "Cream",
		"biography": "<p>Although Cream were only together for a little more than two years, their influence was immense, both during their late-'60s peak and in the years following their breakup. Cream were the first top group to truly exploit the power-trio format, in the process laying the foundation for much blues-rock and hard rock of the 1960s and 1970s. It was with Cream, too, that guitarist <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B64692~>Eric Clapton</a> truly became an international superstar. Critical revisionists have tagged the band as overrated, citing the musicians' emphasis upon flash, virtuosity, and showmanship at the expense of taste and focus. This was sometimes true of their live shows in particular, but in reality the best of their studio recordings were excellent fusions of blues, pop, and psychedelia, with concise original material outnumbering the bloated blues jams and overlong solos.</p><p>Cream could be viewed as the first rock supergroup to become superstars, although none of the three members were that well known when the band formed in mid-1966. <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B64692~>Eric Clapton</a> had the biggest reputation, having established himself as a guitar hero first with <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B5888~>the Yardbirds</a>, and then in a more blues-intensive environment with <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B4860~>John Mayall's Bluesbreakers</a>. (In the States, however, he was all but unknown, having left <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B5888~>the Yardbirds</a> before ~For Your Love~ made the American Top Ten.) Bassist/singer <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B3787~>Jack Bruce</a> and drummer Ginger Baker had both been in the Graham Bond Organisation, an underrated British R&amp;B combo that drew extensively upon the jazz backgrounds of the musicians. Bruce had also been, very briefly, a member of <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B4860~>the Bluesbreakers</a> along Clapton, and also briefly a member of Manfred Mann when he became especially eager to pay the rent.</p><p>All three of the musicians yearned to break free of the confines of the standard rock/R&amp;B/blues group, in a unit that would allow them greater instrumental and improvisational freedom, somewhat in the mold of a jazz outfit. <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B64692~>Eric Clapton's</a> stunning guitar solos would get much of the adulation, yet Bruce was at least as responsible for shaping the group's sound, singing most of the material in his rich voice. He also wrote their best original compositions, sometimes in collaboration with outside lyricist Pete Brown.</p><p>At first Cream's focus was electrified and amped-up traditional blues, which dominated their first album, <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=A4725~><i>Fresh Cream</i></a>, which made the British Top Ten in early 1967. Originals like ~N.S.U.~ and ~I Feel Free~ gave notice that the band were capable of moving beyond the blues, and they truly found their voice on <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=A4726~><i>Disraeli Gears</i></a> in late 1967, which consisted mostly of group-penned songs. Here they fashioned invigorating, sometimes beguiling hard-driving psychedelic pop, which included plenty of memorable melodies and effective harmonies along with the expected crunching riffs. ~Strange Brew,~ ~Dance the Night Away,~ ~Tales of Brave Ulysses,~ and ~S.W.L.A.B.R.~ are all among their best tracks, and the album broke the band bigtime in the States, reaching the Top Five. It also generated their first big U.S. hit single, ~Sunshine of Your Love,~ which was based around one of the most popular hard-rock riffs of the '60s.</p><p>With the double album <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=A4729~><i>Wheels of Fire</i></a>, Cream topped the American charts in 1968, establishing themselves alongside <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B3644~>the Beatles</a> and <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B85934~>Hendrix</a> as one of the biggest rock acts in the world. The record itself was a more erratic affair than <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=A4726~><i>Disraeli Gears</i></a>, perhaps dogged by the decision to present separate discs of studio and live material; the concert tracks in particular did much to establish their reputation, for good or ill, for stretching songs way past the ten-minute mark on stage. The majestically doomy ~White Room~ gave Cream another huge American single, and the group were firmly established as one of the biggest live draws of any kind. Their decision to disband in late 1968 -- at a time when they were seemingly on top of the world -- came as a shock to most of the rock audience.</p><p>Cream's short lifespan, however, was in hindsight unsurprising given the considerable talents, ambitions, and egos of each of its members. Clapton in particular was tired of blowing away listeners with sheer power, and wanted to explore more subtle directions. After a farewell tour of the States, the band broke up in November 1968. In 1969, however, they were in a sense bigger than ever -- a posthumous album featuring both studio and live material, <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=A4732~><i>Goodbye</i></a>, made number two, highlighted by the haunting <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B64692~>Eric Clapton</a>-<a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B4444~>George Harrison</a> composition ~Badge,~ which remains one of Cream's most beloved tracks.</p><p>Clapton and Baker would quickly resurface in 1969 as half of another short-lived supergroup, <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B3701~>Blind Faith</a>, and Clapton of course went on to one of the longest and most successful careers of anyone in the rock business. Bruce and Baker never attained nearly as high a profile after leaving Cream, but both have kept busy in the ensuing decades with various interesting projects in the fields of rock, jazz, and experimental music.</p><p><b>Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide</b></p>",

				"review": "<p>This compilation of 22 Cream BBC tracks from 1966-1968 marked a major addition to the group's discography, particularly as they released relatively little product during their actual lifetime. All of but two of these cuts (~Lawdy Mama~ and the 1968 version of ~Steppin' Out,~ which had appeared on Eric Clapton's <i>Crossroads</i> box) were previously unreleased, and although many of these had made the round on bootlegs, the sound and presentation here is unsurprisingly preferable. As for actual surprises, there aren't many. It's a good cross section of songs from their studio records, though a couple, ~Steppin' Out~ and ~Traintime,~ only appeared on live releases, and some of these BBC takes actually predate the release and recording of the album versions, which makes them of historical interest for intense Cream fans. (There are also four brief interviews with Eric Clapton from the original broadcasts.) There's a mild surprise in the absence of a version of ~White Room,~ but otherwise many of the group's better compositions and covers are here, including ~I Feel Free,~ ~N.S.U.,~ ~Strange Brew,~ ~Tales of Brave Ulysses,~ ~Sunshine of Your Love,~ ~Born Under a Bad Sign,~ ~Outside Woman Blues,~ ~Crossroads,~ ~We're Going Wrong,~ ~I'm So Glad,~ ~SWLABR,~ and ~Politician.~</p><p>Cream took better advantage of the live-in-the-studio BBC format than some groups of similar stature. There's a lean urgency to most of the performances that, while not necessarily superior to the more fully realized and polished studio renditions, do vary notably in ambience from the more familiar versions. The sound quality is good but not perfect, and variable; sometimes it's excellent, yet at other times there seem to be imperfections in the tapes sourced, with ~Sunshine of Your Love~ suffering from a (not grievously) hollow, muffled quality. If there's any other slight criticism of this set, it's that a handful of BBC tracks don't appear, including some that don't make it onto this CD in any version, like ~Sleepy Time Time,~ ~Toad,~ and ~Sitting on Top of the World.~ Given Cream's tendency to over-improvise on the band's live concert recordings, however, the concise nature of these BBC tracks (none of which exceed five minutes) makes them preferable listening in some respects.</p>&mdash; <b>Richie Unterberger</b>"

				"review": "<p>For one reason or another, Cream reunited in the spring of 2005, setting aside nearly 40 years of acrimony for a series of gigs at the Royal Albert Hall in May, which was later followed by a few shows at Madison Square Garden about a month after souvenirs of the London shows -- a double-CD set and a double DVD set -- were released. By that time, tickets for the New York concerts were long gone, which was understandable, since Cream had not only remained a legendary band, but it seemed extremely unlikely that they would ever play live again, so the chance to see the original power trio in the flesh was tempting. Fans that anxiously awaited this reunion might find the record of the event, bearing the unweildy title Royal Albert Hall: London 2-3-5-6 05, a bit anticlimatic, or a mixed blessing at the very least. The chemistry between guitarist/vocalist Eric Clapton, bassist/vocalist Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger Baker is still palpable on this compilation of highlights from the four Royal Albert Hall shows -- it's just quite a bit more subdued than it was the last time they played together which, discounting a one-off reunion at their 1993 induction to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, was 36 years ago.</p> <p>That's a long time ago and the group are no longer restless young psychedelic bluesmen-- at time of the concerts Eric Clapton had just turned 60, Jack Bruce was a couple weeks shy of his 62nd birthday, Ginger Baker was 65. Of course, they're hardly the only group of '60s veterans that have remained active -- the Rolling Stones released a new album of material a month before this live album, and they're all in their '60s, but there's a big difference between the two bands, and that's that the Stones kept playing together throughout the past four decades. While all three members of Cream remained relatively active (Baker recently had retired to his ranch, but kept playing professionally into the '90s, even teaming up with Bruce on occasion), they never played a unit, so they're a little rusty in terms of inter-band relations, which winds up making them sound their age.</p><p>Not only do they never rock as hard as the Stones do on A Bigger Bang, but Cream never approximates the furious rush of energy that the band did at their prime and there's never a sense of the push-and-pull dynamics between the three members that made the best of their lengthy jams sound alive and at times unpredictable. Part of this is down to age, not just in the sense that they're a little bit older and a little bit slower, but because those four decades have changed their style a little. Baker is a tighter drummer, lacking the reckless, volatile energy that wound up either as thrilling or turgid. Bruce can't hit the high notes anymore, doesn't roam as much on the bass, but he still manages to dominate with his fluid instrumental and vocal phrasing; plus, his bass just sounds enormous, as if it could conquer the earth. Clapton plays like a millionaire with impeccable taste yet in this stripped down setting, he's forced to play more than he has in years; at times, he's too refined and relies on familiar licks -- plus, his reliance on a Strat over the Gibsons that fueled his Cream sound does give this a noticeable lack of heft, even if he gets a good approximation of his classic warm tone -- but there are times, like when he holds a single note longer than Neil Young on ~Cinammon Girl,~ that he takes greater risks than he has in years. So, this winds up not necessarily exciting, but it's far from embarassing, either, and there's a certain sense of admiration in hearing the trio pull it together for a respectable performance. In no way does this replace the group's original studio albums -- or the excellent BBC Sessions or even the patchwork live albums they released just after their breakup -- but this does act as a nice coda to their brief career.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"name": "Crowded House",
		"biography": "<P>An institution in their homeland, a two-hit wonder in the U.S., and, during the last half of their ten-year career, bona fide stars in the U.K. and most of Europe, Crowded House recorded some of the best pop music of the late '80s and early '90s. Leader Neil Finn's carefully crafted songs, meticulous eye for lyrical detail, and gift for melody are matched by few other songwriters.</P><P>Crowded House formed in 1985 when Neil Finn dissolved Split Enz rather than carry on after his brother Tim, the group's founding member, left to pursue a solo career. Instead of carrying through with the new wave direction of latter-day Split Enz, Neil moved in favor of a stripped-down, back-to-basics combo featuring ex-Enz drummer Paul Hester, bassist Nick Seymour, and guitarist Craig Hooper. Initially, the group dubbed itself after Finn's middle name, touring Australia and recording demos under the name the Mullanes; Hooper was dropped shortly after this formative period. In June of 1985, the group headed to Los Angeles to shop for a record label, eventually signing with Capitol Records. Capitol requested that the band change its name and the group settled on Crowded House, a reflection of the bandmembers' living conditions in L.A. They began work on their debut, enlisting the help of then-unknown producer Mitchell Froom. A partnership between the band and the producer formed, making Froom nearly a fourth member. The partnership benefited both the band and the producer -- the band was helped by Froom's direct approach and more ~American~ sound as well as his input as a musician, and Froom was able to build a career as a high-profile producer.</P><P>Crowded House's self-titled debut didn't gain much attention upon its release in the summer of 1986, due to insufficient promotion from Capitol Records. In wake of the weak support from Capitol, the bandmembers took matters into their own hands. Rather than setting out on an expensive large-scale tour, the group took a more low-profile route, playing acoustic sets for industry insiders and for small crowds at ethnic restaurants and in record stores. This unorthodox approach began a buzz within the industry. On the talk-show circuit, they won over American and Canadian audiences with their charm and wit as well as their wacky antics. By February of 1987, the album broke into the American Top 40, eventually peaking at number 12. The album spawned the number two hit single ~Don't Dream It's Over~ and ~Something So Strong,~ which reached number seven. In Australia and New Zealand, multi-platinum success followed.</P><P>Released in 1988, Temple of Low Men was anything but a sophomore slump -- Neil Finn's new songs were among his finest, showcasing a notable progression in his songcraft. The album's slightly darker material, however, made for a more difficult listen and, although the material was stronger, the record lacked the immediate appeal of the debut. This, coupled with Capitol's lack of promotional support, led to disappointing sales -- the album barely broke the U.S. Top 40 and the single, ~Better Be Home Soon,~ stalled at number 42. Since hope had basically run out for the album, they abandoned plans for a major U.S. tour. A three-month break in touring revitalized the band for a well-received Australian and Canadian tour, but by mid-1989 the band had effectively broken up.</P><P>Late in 1989, Neil reunited with his brother Tim and the duo began writing songs together for the first time, with the intention of releasing the material on a proposed Finn Brothers album. The collaboration was successful and the duo was prolific, writing 14 songs in a very short time. After the initial sessions with Tim, Neil began working on a new set of songs, designed for the next Crowded House album, but he soon found the new material unsatisfactory. Neil decided to combine the better moments of the Finn Brothers project and the scrapped third album, adding his brother as a fourth member of Crowded House.</P><P>Crowded House's third album, Woodface, released in the summer of 1991, proved the decision to combine the material from the two scrapped records was sound -- the album certainly represents their finest recorded moments. Although the choice of ~Chocolate Cake~ as a leadoff single was both misleading and off-putting to American audiences, effectively sinking the album's chances of success in the U.S., England and Europe embraced the band for the first time. After about six months of dormancy, they began charting in the U.K. and Europe with several singles, including the smash ~Weather With You.~ The British success of ~Weather With You~ helped Woodface achieve platinum status in the U.K., and led the group to several headlining concerts at Wembley Arena. Tim, for all of his invaluable contributions in the writing and recording of Woodface, proved extraneous to the band's live show. He left the band in November 1991, as the band was in the middle of its tour and just prior to its breakthrough success in England. Following the success of Woodface, both Neil and Tim Finn were awarded OBEs from the Queen of England in 1993; the honor was bestowed for their contributions to the arts.</P><P>In early 1993, Crowded House regrouped to record their fourth album, adding American guitarist Mark Hart (who had briefly toured with the band around the time of Temple of Low Men) to the band and dropping Mitchell Froom as their producer, opting instead for ex-Killing Joke member Youth. Together Alone was released in October 1993 (January 1994 in North America) to unanimously positive reviews and solid sales in every country except the United States. Upon its release, Together Alone entered the English charts at number four; at the time, Woodface was still in the U.K. charts. After the album was released, Crowded House embarked on a successful European tour. They were beginning an American tour when Paul Hester decided to leave the band to spend more time with his new family. Hiring a session drummer, the band rounded out the tour, eventually returning to Australia.</P><P>By the end of 1994, Neil Finn decided to cut back on the touring to work on side projects, which included some production work for Dave Dobbyn and a second try at a Finn Brothers album with Tim. The Finn Brothers finally released their long-awaited duet album in the fall of 1995. In June of 1996, Neil officially broke up Crowded House. That same month, Recurring Dream: The Very Best of Crowded House was released, entering the U.K. and Australian charts at number one. After a handful of ~final shows~ in various locations, on Sunday, November 24, 1996, Crowded House played their official farewell show at the Sydney Opera House to 100,000 fans as a benefit for the Sydney Children's Hospital Fund.</P><P>In 1997, Paul Hester formed a new band, Largest Living Things, releasing two EPs and playing regular gigs in Australia as well as hosting his own television show. Neil Finn made his debut as a solo artist in June 1998 with Try Whistling This. In December 1999, Afterglow, an album's worth of Crowded House leftovers and rarities, was issued in Australia and New Zealand; the album was released in the U.K. during January of the following year.</P><P>Neil Finn continued recording both as a solo artist and as part of the Finn Brothers with his brother Tim. In 2005, Paul Hester, after years of battling depression, took his own life near his home in Australia.</P>— <B>Chris Woodstra</B>",

Instead, Finn digs into the depths of his emotional psyche with obsessive detail, crafting a set of intense, personal songs that range from the all-too-intimate look at infidelity of ~Into Temptation,~ to the raucous exorcism of ~Kill Eye.~ Through all of this introspective soul-searching, Finn reveals most of all his true mastery of melody.</p>— <b>Chris Woodstra</b>"

Cummings began with Melbourne's the Pelaco Brothers during the mid-'70s. He then fronted the Sports for six years before they disbanded in 1981. Cummings' debut single, ~We All Make Mistakes,~ was released in January 1983 and a debut dance-oriented album, <i>Senso</i>, in August 1984. A non-album single, ~What Am I Going to Do?,~ was released in August 1985, before the more laid-back <i>This Wonderful Life</i> in September 1986. In 1987, he collaborated with ex-Sports guitarist Andrew Pendlebury for the single ~She Set Fire to the House.~</p><p>Another low-key outing, <i>Lovetown</i>, was released in January 1988, and Cummings formed Stephen Cummings Lovetown to tour. His third album, <i>A New Kind of Blue</i>, won the 1989 Australian Record Industry Award (ARIA) for Best Adult Contemporary Album. <i>Good Humour</i>, released in 1990, marked a return to his earlier dance style. His 1992 outing, <i>Unguided Tour</i>, produced a more rock-driven sound. Steve Kilbey of the Church produced Cummings' next two albums, <i>Falling Swinger</i> (1994) and <i>Escapist</i> (1996). In between albums, Cummings recorded a duet with Toni Childs called ~Fell From a Great Height.~ In 1996, Cummings' first novel, Wonder Boy, was published followed by a compilation album in 1997, <i>Puppet Pauper Pirate Poet Pawn & King</i>. Cummings is also the voice and co-writer behind the TV advertisement I Feel Better Now, a popular Australian advertisement for health insurers Medibank Private.</p>&mdash; <b>Brendan Swift</b>",

It has that urgency so many records seem to lack these days.”</p><p><i>CLOSE-UPS</i> was recorded at Joe Camilleri’s Woodstock Studios in Melbourne with long time collaborators Shane O’Mara on guitars and Rebecca Barnard on harmony vocals, plus Howard Cairns (bass), Peter Jones (drums) and James Black (electric piano).</p>"

		"lastname": "Danko",
		"name": "Rick Danko",
		"biography": "<p>Since 1965, when he and his cohorts in The Band (then called The Hawks) conspired with Bob Dylan to ~go electric,~ Rick Danko has been an integral part of the popular music landscape. As lead singer, bassist and acoustic guitar player for The Band, and as a solo artist, his contributions have been substantial.</p><p>Hailing from Walsh, about a mile and a half from the tiny rural town of Simcoe, Ontario, Rick was born into a musical family. Both of his parents and his three brothers played instruments and/or sang, and music was a way of life for him from the beginning. He listened to Hank Williams and Sam Cooke as a small child, and was ~ready to go to Nashville~ by the age of seven. With his oldest brother, Maurice (~Junior~), Rick sang and performed at family get-togethers and made his public debut on four-string tenor banjo before an audience of his first-grade classmates.</p><p>Rick quit school at 14 to pursue music full-time and in 1960, when he was 17, he joined rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins’ group, The Hawks, initially as rhythm guitarist. He soon moved to bass, learning his instrument ~one string at a time,~ and, with the help of the Hawks’ boogie-woogie piano player (and later, pianist for the late 1980s incarnation of The Band) Stan Szelest, whose left-hand techniques he memorized and adapted to his bass playing, began developing his trademark percussive but sliding style.</p><p>Under Ronnie Hawkins’ tutelage, Rick began a three-year tenure of non-stop gigging and rigorous rehearsals that fellow Band-mate Richard Manuel once likened to ~boot camp.~ By the time he was 20, he was a seasoned pro, having spent most of his teenage years ~playing in bars that you were supposed to be 21 to play in.~</p><p>By the early 60s, Rick and the other Hawks had outgrown the limited roadhouse and honky-tonk circuit and left Hawkins to pursue greener pastures. Bob Dylan saw them perform in the mid-60s and was so impressed that he signed The Hawks to accompany him on his 1965-66 World Tour. The Band’s collaboration with Dylan, initially greeted with boos and catcalls around the globe, changed the course of popular music by spawning one of the most significant musical hybrids of the rock era, ~Folk Rock.~</p><p>Rick’s penchant for musical hybrids began germinating, literally, in his own backyard in Simcoe, a town heavily populated with displaced Southern tobacco farmers. The interesting mix of Northern and Southern cultures there was later reflected in his music and is partly responsible for the occasional Southern inflection that colored some of his words.</p><p>After the tumultuous world tours with Dylan (the European leg of which was documented in the obscure film Eat the Document), Rick moved from Manhattan to upstate New York, along with Dylan and the other members of the still-unnamed Band. He rented a big pink house in West Saugerties, near Woodstock, and with Dylan and The Band began recording songs which soon surfaced on bootlegs and were officially released in 1975 as <i>The Basement Tapes</i>.</p><p>In 1968, after toying with a host of politically incorrect names, like the Crackers and the Honkies, The Band made its official debut with the release of its seminal and eclectic album, <i>Music From Big Pink</i> (Capitol), which became the fulcrum for the country rock and roots rock of the coming decades.</p><p>The music of The Band was at once traditional and contemporary, and the combination made it timeless. In the eye of the psychedelic hurricane, The Band virtually pioneered the use of traditional instruments like mandolins, accordions and fiddles in rock & roll, and Rick Danko was one of the first non-rockabilly players to use stand-up acoustic bass on a rock record. In the midst of political unrest and the peace movement, The Band’s lyrics celebrated real life - beauty, tranquillity, nature, good sex, good friends, small town America, Southern culture - a series of themes whose influences would be felt in another musical hybrid, Americana, 25 years later.</p><p><i>Big Pink</i> catapulted The Band, if not to commercial superstardom, to the upper echelon of rock music. Many brows were furrowed, but accolades abounded, and even Eric Clapton cited them as a major influence and the impetus for leaving the electric power trio Cream behind to go solo.</p><p>A succession of albums and tours followed and The Band, now a firm fixture in the rock aristocracy, played virtually every major festival from Woodstock to Watkins Glen. In 1976, on Thanksgiving Day, The Band officially called it quits with a farewell concert at San Francisco’s Winterland Ballroom. The concert, which featured an unprecedented all-star lineup to which The Band graciously played back-up, was documented in Martin Scorsese’s much lauded film, <i>The Last Waltz</i>, regarded by many as the finest concert film of all time.</p><p>After <i>The Last Waltz</i>, Rick, who needed music as much as it needed him, continued to perform and record. His 1978 debut solo album, a self-titled gem which was initially overshadowed by the grandeur of <i>The Last Waltz</i> but has since garnered both critical and popular acclaim, marked the beginning of a very important period in Rick’s career.</p><p>His transition from ensemble player to frontman seemed an easy one. <i>Rick Danko</i> (Arista) was not a Band album in disguise. On the contrary, it showcased his individuality--his wonderful harmonies, his mature and sensitive songwriting, his sense of humor (evidenced on the tongue-in-cheek ~Java Blues~), his ~less is more~ approach to playing and arranging, his affinity for odd collaborations (the pairing of Eric Clapton’s electric rock guitar with Band-mate Garth Hudson’s ethereal country accordion on the Danko-penned ~New Mexico~), and the strongest vocal work of his career.</p><p>During the early 1980s, Rick maintained a low profile and, in 1983, reunited with The Band (minus Robbie Robertson, who pursued a solo career). During that period, he began playing acoustic guitar as well as bass onstage, and his unique style of tuning and playing (revealing the bass player in his soul) became another of his signature sounds. Throughout the 80s, never one to ~sit at home,~ Rick continued to play solo, with The Band, in pairings with Richard Manuel, Levon Helm, Paul Butterfield, Jorma Kaukonen and others. In 1985, he appeared (with Manuel, Helm and Hudson) in a feature film, Man Outside, and in 1987, he released an instructional video, Rick Danko’s Electric Bass Techniques (Homespun).</p><p>The end of the decade marked the beginning of one of the most productive phases in Rick’s life and career. In 1989, he and Band drummer/vocalist Levon Helm toured as part of Ringo Starr’s All-Starr Band (Rick’s rendition of Buddy Holly’s ~Raining In My Heart,~ which appeared on the live album <i>Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band</i> (Rykodisc) and features Clarence Clemons on sax, became a highlight of his live solo shows). That same year, The Band was inducted at Canada’s Juno Awards into the Hall of Fame of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.</p><p>In 1990, Rick, along with Helm, Hudson, Sinead O’Connor, Van Morrison and others, appeared in Roger Waters’ <i>The Wall</i> concert in Berlin. In October, 1992 Rick performed with The Band at the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Tribute at Madison Square Garden and, in January, 1994, he and The Band were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The induction speech was made by long-time friend and fan, Eric Clapton.</p><p>In 1991, Rick began working on a project that would become near and dear to his heart, a collaboration with Folk legend Eric Andersen and Norwegian singer/songwriter Jonas Fjeld. The almost immediate result of the trio’s collaboration was an award-winning album, <i>Danko Fjeld Andersen</i> (Stageway), which was honored in Norway with a Spellemans Pris (the Norwegian Grammy) for Record of the Year and was released in late 1993 by Rykodisc. The Rykodisc release was honored by AFIM (formerly NAIRD) the following year. Danko Fjeld Andersen, which contains some of Rick’s finest work, received a four-star review in Rolling Stone.</p><p>1993 proved to be a banner year for Rick. In addition to the ~<i>Trio Album</i>,~ Rick and The Band recorded their first studio album in 17 years, the acclaimed <i>Jericho</i> (Pyramid), which featured a rootsy rendition of Bruce Springsteen’s ~Atlantic City,~ and several original compositions. In early 1996, The Band released <i>High On The Hog</i> (Pyramid) and in February, 1997, Rykodisc released <i>Ridin’ On The Blinds</i>, the follow-up to Danko Fjeld Andersen, which was recorded in Norway in 1994. <i>Jubilation</i>, The Band’s third album in five years, was released on River North Records in September, 1998.</p><p>In September 1999, Rick came back strong with an 11-song collection of inspired performances called <i>Live On Breeze Hill</i>. Rick was joined on this mostly live outing by some of the finest musicians in the business, including Band-mate Garth Hudson and long-time collaborator and Band co-producer Aaron Hurwitz. Eric Clapton said of Rick in 1999 ~Rick’s singing has had a tremendous influence on me - it’s only my own humble opinion, but I think you have to be a great musician before you can sing like that.~ Rick’s voice indeed sounded better than ever, and he began actively promoting the CD, as well as laying down tracks for a new album (which would be released, posthumously, in August 2000 as <i>Times Like These</i>).</p><p>On December 10, 1999, Rick Danko died as he had lived - simply, without fanfare, pomp or pretense. If the tears, prayers and tributes that followed are any indication, this country boy whose goal was to ~help the neighborhood~ certainly succeeded. The world is a much better place because of Rick Danko, and a much sadder one without him.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Carol Caffin</b></p>",

Darling and Bjornstad were reunited in the subsequent album Epigraphs, although I don't think it quite captures the magic of this effort. They are also heard in the soundtrack to Jean-Luc Godard's film ~Forever Mozart~. After working on the earlier album ~The Sea~, Bjornstad wrote about the processes that lead to ~The River~: ~I spent the winter of 1994/5 researching and playing music of the late renaissance, paying particular attention to the clarity of William Byrd's and Orlando Gibbons's melodic invention, trying to 'translate' some of this into a modern idiom, trying to find a contemporary language for further dialogues.~</p><p>This album deserves to share the higher profile of other ECM artists like Jan Garbarek & the Hilliard Ensemble. See also the soundtrack music of Eleni Karaindrou (Music for Films, Ulysses Gaze,...) for other richly textured marvels in the ECM roster.</p>&mdash; <b>Michael G. Williams</b>     <br><br><hr><br><p>Ketil Bjornstad comes from Norway and on this, his third release on the ECM label, teams up with American cello player David Darling again. David Darling had of course made an appearance on a previous release entitled The Sea. Darling is without doubt one of the more influential players on the scene today lending tremendous imagination and color and tonality to whatever he puts his bow to. He started originally with Paul Winter, in the same line up as Ralph Towner and Collin Walcott who would later form the band Oregon. Darling of course would in later years make a name for himself with the album EOS which he recorded with Terje Rypdal, consisting of screaming improvised guitar and cello duets. Classical meets Norwegian rock, further enhancing ECM's name and reputation, not to mention their own .Ketil Bjornstad is more of a classical player than a jazz figure. His background is with the Oslo Philharmonic. Born in 1952, KB is these days a leading arts figure in Norway, not only a respected pianist but also a writer of sorts.</p><p>The River contains twelve duets between the two players. It's fairly slow music and continues KB's fascination with aquatic themes, which started with Water Stories, featuring Terje Rypdal and Bjorn Kjellemyr from The Chasers, as well as drummer Jon Christensen and leading on to 1995's release The Sea, featuring the same line up. This is more introspective and is contemplative in feel. This is a fine combination that works well together. This is very refined music from two leading classical figures who are not afraid to cross over. For myself, I am very drawn to the dark textures that David Darling is able to produce and if you are aware of his previous releases like Darkwood then this might appeal.</p>"

		"biography": "<p>The South African vocalist/guitarist Dave Matthews formed the Dave Matthews Band in Virginia in the early '90s. Featuring Matthews, Stefan Lessard, Leroi Moore, Boyd Tinsley, and Carter Beauford, the group's music presents a more pop-oriented version of the Grateful Dead crossed with the worldbeat explorations of Paul Simon and Sting. The band built up a strong word-of-mouth following in the early '90s by touring the country constantly, concentrating on college campuses. In addition to amassing a sizable following, their self-released album, Remember Two Things, sold well for an independent release; soon, they were attracting the attention of majors. Signing with RCA, the Dave Matthews Band released their major-label debut, Under the Table & Dreaming, in the fall of 1994. By spring of 1995, the record had launched the hit single ~What Would You Say~ and sold over a million copies.</p><p>A year-and-a-half after the release of Under the Table & Dreaming, the record had sold over four million copies in the U.S. alone. In April of 1996, the Dave Matthews Band released Crash, which entered the charts at number two and quickly went platinum. Throughout 1996, the group toured behind Crash, sending it to double-platinum status. Also in 1996, Matthews launched an attack on bootleggers in conjunction with the Federal Government, targeting stores that were selling semi-legal discs of live performances. The efforts of Matthews, his band, and his management resulted in an unprecedented crackdown on bootleggers in early 1997 -- with nearly all of the major foreign bootlegging companies placed under arrest by the United States -- thereby putting a moratorium on the entire underground industry.</p><p>To further combat the bootleggers, Dave Matthews released an official, double-disc live album, Live at Red Rocks 8-15-95, in the fall of 1997. It was an unexpected success, debuting at number three on the charts and selling a million copies within the first five months of its release. The live record paved the way for the April 1998 release of Before These Crowded Streets, the group's most ambitious album to date. Another live effort, Listener Supported, followed a year later. Summer tours also packed the late '90s, with sold-out shows across the U.S. The new millennium, however, saw the band back in the studio with Glen Ballard to record their fourth studio album. <i>Everyday</i> was issued in February 2001. The following summer, the band issued <i>Busted Stuff</i>. Debut single ~Where Are You Going~ was also featured on the soundtrack to the Adam Sandler flick Mr. Deeds.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>",

Although the group appeals to the same audience as Blues Traveler, Hootie & the Blowfish, and the Spin Doctors, the Dave Matthews Band has more influences than their peers. Fusing together folk-rock, worldbeat, jazz, and pop, the band is arguably the most musically adept of all their contemporaries. However, they have trouble coming up with engaging hooks, as their third album, Crash, proves. Although the band continues to get better -- their musical cross-breeding is effortless and seamless -- they often don't have an attractive frame for their skills. Strangely, the lack of memorable melodies doesn't particularly hurt the album -- it actually emphasizes the band's instrumental talents. Nevertheless, since there's a lack of strong pop hooks, Crash is an album that will please fans, but not novices.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

Bootleggers had discovered that certain bands had voracious audiences who would listen to anything by the group. Once Dave Matthews discovered he had one of those bands and that he had scores of unofficial discs on the market, he decided to release official live albums on a regular basis. A good business decision, but it has the effect of diluting his discography somewhat, especially when the end result is as ordinary as Listener Supported. Unlike audience tapes and bootlegged shows -- which, in an ideal world, capture a band loose and unaware -- the concert on Listener Supported was recorded for a PBS television show, In the Spotlight. This may have affected their performance somewhat, since there just isn't much energy to the recording. Part of the problem is that DMB don't really explore new musical territory through improvisations -- they just settle into a groove and ride it. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it does mean that there's not as much identity to an individual DMB show as there is in, say, a Phish show. When the band nails the groove live, they can be more engaging than they are on record. But if they just float on by, as they do on Listener Supported, the songs and jams are flatter and never really go anywhere. If you're already a fan -- a very devoted fan -- that's fine, but otherwise, listening to these two discs nonstop will be a little dull. DMB are capable of more than this; Listener Supported just captures them on an off night.</b>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<p>After the bootleg industry was revolutionized by CDs in the late '80s, it seemed that every contemporary recording artist had at least one bootleg on the market. It wasn't that studio outtakes were suddenly available -- it was that it was easier than ever to record, press, and distribute live concerts. Rock bands who jammed, whether they were hard rockers like Pearl Jam or noodlers like Phish, were in particular demand since, as the adage goes, no two shows were exactly alike. Given this insatiable appetite for new live records, it's a wonder that more artists didn't make like Dave Matthews and launch a series of official releases of notable live shows. It especially makes sense in Matthews' case, since his band sounds better and is more adventurous in a live setting than it is in the studio, as the first installment, Live at Red Rocks, illustrated. Its follow-up, Live at Luther College, takes a different tactic. Instead of featuring the band, it's Matthews alone acoustically, supported by his friend, session guitarist Tim Reynolds. The double-disc album was culled from the duo's 1996 tour, and not surprisingly, the bulk of the material focuses on Matthews' first two albums for RCA. What is surprising is that the songs arguably sound better in this setting, since all of the group improvisations are stripped away, leaving the songs to speak for themselves. Accordingly, Matthews isn't nearly as eccentric in his vocal tics, letting the music flow simply and engagingly. The results are quite entertaining, and even if the album was intended just for fans, it's the rare specialty item that could win new listeners.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

Often, their records hinted at the eclecticism and adventure inherent in those improvisation, but Before These Crowded Streets is the first album to fully capture that adventurous spirit. Not coincidentally, it's their least accessible record, even if it's more of a consolidation than it is a step forward. Early Dave Matthews albums were devoted to the worldbeat fusions of Graceland and Sting, but his RCA efforts incorporated these influences into a smoother, pop-oriented style. Here, everything hangs out. Old trademarks, like jittery acoustic grooves and jazzy chords, are here, augmented by complex polyrhythms, Mideastern dirges, and on two tracks, the slashing strings of the Kronos Quartet. Some fans may find the new, darker textures a little disarming at first, but they're a logical extension of the group's work, and in many ways, this sonic daring results in the most rewarding album they've yet recorded. The Dave Matthews Band haven't completely vanquished their demons, however -- songwriting remains a problem, especially since relying on grooves, improvisation, and texture allows them to skimp on melody, and Matthews' lyrics can be awkward and embarrassing, especially if he's writing about sex. Still, these are minor flaws on an album that relies on tone and improvisation, both of which are in ample supply on Before These Crowded Streets.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

Ballard has a tremendous influence on the resulting record, collaborating with Matthews on every track and changing the direction of their sound. To a certain extent, the change is welcome, since <i>Before These Crowded Streets</i> suggested that the group was running out of steam, but the sudden shift toward measured maturation and slickness is jarring all the same, since it emphasizes Matthews' melodies and leadership over the group interplay that is the group's calling card. It's not that the music is now simplistic, since there are still some tricky rhythms and shifts in tone, but the group doesn't have much room to stretch in Ballard's precise arrangements. In a sense, they sort of benefit from this increased focus, since the group's instrumental excursions can be a little flabby, but it still robs them of much of their character. Also, <i>Everyday</i> sounds like it was the product of a difficult birth, and wouldn't have gelled if Ballard hadn't been involved, pushing Matthews toward completion. It does result in a record that's more cohesive than its predecessor, but it's far less engagingly loose-limbed than DMB at its peak. Perhaps that's just a byproduct of maturation, but Everyday feels like forced maturation, a record that suppresses the group's best attributes in favor of a moderate, self-consciously classy stab at adult pop. That it works pretty well at that level is a testament to Ballard's skills, but it feels more like a weirdly abortive solo project by Matthews than a full-fledged DMB effort.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<p>The Dave Matthews Band may not have released the Lillywhite Sessions — the semi-legendary soul-searching album recorded in 2000 but abandoned in favor of the heavy-handed, laborious Glen Ballard-produced <i>Everyday</i> — but they couldn't escape its shadow. Every review, every article surrounding the release of Everyday mentioned it, often claiming it was better than the released project — an opinion the band seemed to support by playing many numbers from the widely bootlegged lost album on tour in 2001. Since they couldn't run away from the Lillywhite Sessions, they decided to embrace it, albeit on their own terms. They didn't just release the album, as is. They picked nine of the best songs from the sessions, reworked some of them a bit, tinkered with the lyrics, re-recorded the tunes with a different producer (Stephen Harris, a veteran of post-Brit-pop bands like the Bluetones, plus engineer on U2's <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i>), added two new songs, and came up with <i>Busted Stuff</i>, a polished commercial spin on music widely considered the darkest, most revealing work Matthews has yet created. Remarkably, these songs not only retain their emotional core even after they've been cleaned up, but they perhaps even gain more resonance in this setting. After all, Steve Lillywhite is hardly Steve Albini, and while the initial versions of these songs were raw, it was as much because they were not quite finished as they were Matthews exposing his soul. Here, these songs have been completed, not just in the writing but in the arrangement and production, so they sound just as personal to Dave Matthews, but also sound like fully realized DMB songs. And while they do jam a bit — in, surprise!, a song called ~Kit Kat Jam~ — that's not the emphasis of their performances; in these slow, moody pieces, they provide supple support to Matthews' elliptical, winding melodies and searching lyrics. The band sounds unified, and so does the album; one of the new songs, ~Where Are You Going,~ sounded dull on its first appearance on the <i>Mr. Deeds</i> soundtrack, but here, it's part of the fabric of the album, equally effective in sustaining the reflective, not depressive, tone of the album. Here, there's none of the loose-limbed, frat-boy funk from DMB's previous albums, none of the smirking jokiness that has plagued their up-tempo jams, while the heartache and yearning that once seemed affected in their ballads is palpably real. It's not so much a departure as it is an unexpected twist in their career. By leaving behind the key elements that defined their music, DMB has revealed that they can hit a deeper emotional chord and, in the process, deliver what's unquestionably the best album of their career.</p>&mdash;<b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

The Gorge, recorded over three nights in 2002, is easily Matthews' finest officially released live outing, even if you can get the entire run in a six-disc set for a very reasonable price through the band's website. This baby just whets the appetite. But does it ever. Matthews and company lay out 14 tracks, many of them less obvious choices than on previous outings. The music here comes from Before These Crowded Streets (a beautiful opening medley of ~Pantala Naga Pampa~ and ~Rapunzel~; ~Ants Marching~ doesn't appear on the CDs at all, just the DVD footage!), ~The Song Jane Likes~ from Remember Two Things, and tracks from Busted Stuff, Crash, Everyday, and even Some Devil. The jams are tighter and rowdier; there's less hippie stuff and more honest to goodness musicianship and groove. And the version of ~Gravedigger~ here is as moving as it is on the studio outing. The singalong at the beginning of ~Everyday,~ featured in a medley with ~No. 36,~ is quite beautiful, not annoying like some similar moments on live records are. The more song-oriented first disc juxtaposes nicely with the more jam-oriented second, which features a smoking version of ~Kit Kat Jam~ and ~Lie in Our Graves.~ The DVD showcases not only concert footage, but the ~Grace Is Gone~ music video and a documentary on the making of it, as well as an intimate look at the Gorge itself, a piece of environmental architecture that is an astonishing music venue and makes Red Rocks look paltry in comparison. Fans will have to have it, to be sure, but this might serve to turn others on to that particular brand of Matthews magic as well.

				"review": "<p>Here is yet another live album by the Dave Matthews Band. This one is from his Central Park Concert in 2003. This one is three CDs, loaded with hits and near-misses, from one of the most successful stage bands in the business. The Matthews Band is tight, full of enough funk and sass to keep it interesting, and yet is able to convey real emotion to tens of thousands of people, as evidenced by their many live recordings. What sets this one apart is its presentation of one concert in its entirety, and its willingness to leave rough edges in. While the sound is pristine, and the performance reflects the band's well-rehearsed acumen, there are those spontaneous moments on this set that get left off of most band's live recordings -- including Matthews' previous ones.</p><p>In addition, this one rocks harder, and is more visceral, than his other offerings of this type. There are 20 tracks spread over this triple-disc, and without doubt, many of the same tracks that have been issued now nearly countless times are here as well: ~Ants Marching,~ ~Dancing Nancies,~ ~All Along the Watchtower,~ (this one shouldn't be issued again until they can read it as dynamically as they did with steel guitar boss Robert Randolph). There is also a guest appearance by Gov't Mule's and the Allman Brothers' Warren Haynes on Disc Three, for a smoking cover of Neil Young's ~Cortez the Killer,~ and a band jam called ~Jimi Thing.~ If you are a fan of Matthews' idiosyncratic rock, this will definitely be a welcome addition to your shelf -- though it's worth speculating that you have tons of bootlegs already. If you are part of the uninitiated, but curious, this is a pretty fine introduction, though admittedly, it is a very big dose all at once.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

				"review": "<p>For those just joining the cult surrounding the Dave Matthews Band, The Best of What's Around, Vol. 1 is actually a stellar introduction. There are two discs in the package, one compiled from the group's studio offerings and a live disc of previously unreleased material (at least ~officially~ unreleased). But then, this set is unique in another way also: the tracks were selected by DMB fans via the band's website. This is the way best-of and compilation recordings should be issued &mdash; by fans, not the suits upstairs. The studio disc contains two cuts from each RCA-issued album, from Under the Table and Dreaming straight through to Stand Up. To everyone's credit, there are two picks from Busted Stuff, a record that was undeserving of the ire it received from some members of the music press. Beginning at the beginning: ~What Would You Say~ and ~Crash into Me~ are obvious picks. (The latter is a track well deserving of its smash success, and one of those songs listeners will be hearing in whatever form radio goes for a very long time.) A thoroughly modern love song, its simple melody, hook, and chorus are memorable from the first time through. Other standouts from the first disc include ~Crush,~ ~Grey Street,~ ~Grace Is Gone,~ and ~Hunger for the Great Light.~ The live platter is wonderfully assembled, jumping back and forth across time from 2000 to 2006. All but one of the selections were recorded in the States, and the performances are stellar — even the version of ~Ants Marching,~ the most over-recorded song in DMB history and one listeners should all get a break from, is wonderfully refreshing here. There are a couple of tracks with guest performances: ~Everyday~ with the great Vusi Mahlasela on vocals, and a scorching read of ~Louisiana Bayou~ with the inimitable Robert Randolph on pedal steel (if you've never heard Randolph, get ready for a mind-blowing treat). Those uninitiated who are wondering what all the fuss has been about for the past decade get a real opportunity here to check out the very best of what's been recorded, and get a small taste of the band live as well. Longtime fans who don't already have the shows referenced here will want to pick it up for the live set alone.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<P>In some ways, two and a half hours of acoustic Dave Matthews with Tim Reynolds seems like it would be a snore — especially since a boatload of these 27 songs range between five and nine minutes! The Dave Matthews Band can get away with such excesses as a group, but in this intimate setting on such a large stage? It's either truly wonderful or something of an exercise in intense ego run riot, right? To be fair, this is not a snore. Reynolds is a hell of a guitarist. He is not one given to random excess and never pretends to be a guitar hero — though he is. The program is simply that this pair brings out Matthews' tunes from both the DMB and his solo recording and plays them for an audience full of adoration and gratitude. And, for the most part, it works. The opening blues moans that introduce ~Bartender~ let the listener know that this is no ordinary acoustic show. Renditions of ~Crush,~ ~Gravedigger,~ ~Some Devil,~ and ~Crash into Me~ are gorgeously done here. There is a conviction in Matthews' voice that is missing on a lot of the band's live records. Likewise, ~Grace Is Gone~ and the cover versions like Neil Young's ~Down by the River,~ Daniel Lanois' ~The Maker,~ and Woody Guthrie's ~This Land Is Your Land~ are also wonderfully done. There is also a new song called ~Sister~ that Matthews overly explains, but the song's terrific.</P><P>There are a few dull moments, but over the entire course of this set they are actually few and far between — unless Matthews' voice gets to you after a while, and then perhaps you're in trouble. When Matthews is lazy (and he often is), the results can be samey sounding — but he's not here. He understands implicitly that his singing is more important than it is with the DMB, and it needs to carry the weight. Reynolds adds so much in terms of color and texture — whether he's playing straight, using effects, playing slide, or inventing some new scale to play a solo in, he transforms what might be merely intimate and engaging into something (mostly) compelling. Even the nine-plus-minute ~Dancing Nancies~ works like a charm because Reynolds is able to create an alternate voice with his lead guitar playing. His solo on Young's ~Down by the River~ actually mimics (on acoustic guitar) the songwriter's, by going into a somewhat extended single-note hammer until it becomes trancelike — he could just as easily have shown off. For Matthews fans, this is essential. For those on the fence about Matthews, this is document enough to win you over to his talent as a songwriter — without spending the fruitless time that DMB recordings take up. For those who liked Some Devil, his solo effort, this document will provide further enjoyment. It's as solid as an extended presentation can be and is, for the most part, thoroughly enjoyable. The great contribution it does provide is to demonstrate what a guitar-picking wonder Reynolds is, even more so than on earlier collaborations between these two. Somebody should sign this guy up, and quick.</P><P>— <B>Thom Jurek</B></P>"

		"firstname": "Miles",
		"lastname": "Davis",
		"name": "Miles Davis",
		"biography": "<p>Throughout a professional career lasting 50 years, Miles Davis played the trumpet in a lyrical, introspective, and melodic style, often employing a stemless Harmon mute to make his sound more personal and intimate. But if his approach to his instrument was constant, his approach to jazz was dazzlingly protean. To examine his career is to examine the history of jazz from the mid-'40s to the early '90s, since he was in the thick of almost every important innovation and stylistic development in the music during that period, and he often led the way in those changes, both with his own performances and recordings and by choosing sidemen and collaborators who forged new directions. It can even be argued that jazz stopped evolving when Davis wasn't there to push it forward.</p><p>Davis was the son of a dental surgeon, Dr. Miles Dewey Davis Jr., and a music teacher, Cleota Mae (Henry) Davis, and thus grew up in the black middle class of east St. Louis after the family moved there shortly after his birth. He became interested in music during his childhood and by the age of 12 began taking trumpet lessons. While still in high school, he started to get jobs playing in local bars and at 16 was playing gigs out of town on weekends. At 17, he joined Eddie Randle's Blue Devils, a territory band based in St. Louis. He enjoyed a personal apotheosis in 1944, just after graduating from high school, when he saw and was allowed to sit in with Billy Eckstine's big band, who was playing in St. Louis. The band featured trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and saxophonist Charlie Parker, the architects of the emerging bebop style of jazz, which was characterized by fast, inventive soloing and dynamic rhythm variations. It is striking that Davis fell so completely under Gillespie and Parker's spell, since his own slower and less flashy style never really compared to theirs. But bebop was the new sound of the day, and the young trumpeter was bound to follow it. He did so by leaving the Midwest to attend the Institute of Musical Art in New York City (renamed Juilliard) in September 1944. Shortly after his arrival in Manhattan, he was playing in clubs with Parker, and by 1945 he had abandoned his academic studies for a full-time career as a jazz musician, initially joining Benny Carter's band and making his first recordings as a sideman. </p><p>He played with Eckstine in 1946-1947 and was a member of Parker's group in 1947-1948, making his recording debut as a leader on a 1947 session that featured Parker, pianist John Lewis, bassist Nelson Boyd, and drummer Max Roach. This was an isolated date, however, and Davis spent most of his time playing and recording behind Parker. But in the summer of 1948, he organized a nine-piece band with an unusual horn section. In addition to himself, it featured an alto saxophone, a baritone saxophone, a trombone, a French horn, and a tuba. This nonet, employing arrangements by Gil Evans and others, played for two weeks at the Royal Roost in New York in September. Earning a contract with Capitol Records, the band went into the studio in January 1949 for the first of three sessions which produced 12 tracks that attracted little attention at first. The band's relaxed sound, however, affected the musicians who played it, among them Kai Winding, Lee Konitz, Gerry Mulligan, John Lewis, J.J. Johnson, and Kenny Clarke, and it had a profound influence on the development of the cool jazz style on the West Coast. In February 1957, Capitol finally issued the tracks together on an LP called <i>Birth of the Cool</i>. Davis, meanwhile, had moved on to co-leading a band with pianist Tadd Dameron in 1949, and the group took him out of the country for an appearance at the Paris Jazz Festival in May. But the trumpeter's progress was impeded by an addiction to heroin that plagued him in the early '50s. His performances and recordings became more haphazard, but in January 1951 he began a long series of recordings for the Prestige label that became his main recording outlet for the next several years. He managed to kick his habit by the middle of the decade, and he made a strong impression playing ~'Round Midnight~ at the Newport Jazz Festival in July 1955, a performance that led the major label Columbia Records to sign him. The prestigious contract allowed him to put together a permanent band, and he organized a quintet featuring saxophonist John Coltrane, pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones who began recording his Columbia debut, <i>'Round About Midnight</i>, in October. As it happened, however, he had a remaining five albums on his Prestige contract, and over the next year he was forced to alternate his Columbia sessions with sessions for Prestige to fulfill this previous commitment. The latter resulted in the Prestige albums The New Miles Davis Quintet, <i>Cookin'</i>, <i>Workin'</i>, <i>Relaxin'</i>, and <i>Steamin'</i>, making Davis' first quintet one of his better-documented outfits.</p><p>In May 1957, just three months after Capitol released the <i>Birth of the Cool</i> LP, Davis again teamed with arranger Gil Evans for his second Columbia LP, <i>Miles Ahead</i>. Playing flügelhorn, Davis fronted a big band on music that extended the Birth of the Cool concept and even had classical overtones. Released in 1958, the album was later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, intended to honor recordings made before the Grammy Awards were instituted in 1959. In December 1957, Davis returned to Paris, where he improvised the background music for the film <i>L'Ascenseur pour l'Echafaud (Escalator to the Gallows)</i>. Jazz Track, an album containing this music, earned him a 1960 Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Performance, Solo, or Small Group. He added saxophonist Cannonball Adderley to his group, creating the Miles Davis Sextet, who recorded the album <i>Milestones</i> in April 1958. Shortly after this recording, Red Garland was replaced on piano by Bill Evans and Jimmy Cobb took over for Philly Joe Jones on drums. In July, Davis again collaborated with Gil Evans and an orchestra on an album of music from <i>Porgy and Bess</i>. Back in the sextet, Davis began to experiment with modal playing, basing his improvisations on scales rather than chord changes. This led to his next band recording, <i>Kind of Blue</i>, in March and April 1959, an album that became a landmark in modern jazz and the most popular disc of Davis' career, eventually selling over two million copies, a phenomenal success for a jazz record. In sessions held in November 1959 and March 1960, Davis again followed his pattern of alternating band releases and collaborations with Gil Evans, recording <i>Sketches of Spain</i>, containing traditional Spanish music and original compositions in that style. The album earned Davis and Evans Grammy nominations in 1960 for Best Jazz Performance, Large Group, and Best Jazz Composition, More Than 5 minutes; they won in the latter category.</p><p>By the time Davis returned to the studio to make his next band album in March 1961, Adderley had departed, Wynton Kelly had replaced Bill Evans at the piano, and John Coltrane had left to begin his successful solo career, being replaced by saxophonist Hank Mobley (following the brief tenure of Sonny Stitt). Nevertheless, Coltrane guested on a couple of tracks of the album, called <i>Someday My Prince Will Come</i>. The record made the pop charts in March 1962, but it was preceded into the bestseller lists by the Davis quintet's next recording, the two-LP set <i>Miles Davis in Person</i> (Friday & Saturday Nights at the Blackhawk, San Francisco), recorded in April. The following month, Davis recorded another live show, as he and his band were joined by an orchestra led by Gil Evans at Carnegie Hall in May. The resulting <i>Miles Davis at Carnegie Hall</i> was his third LP to reach the pop charts, and it earned Davis and Evans a 1962 Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Performance by a Large Group, Instrumental. Davis and Evans teamed up again in 1962 for what became their final collaboration, <i>Quiet Nights</i>. The album was not issued until 1964, when it reached the charts and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance by a Large Group or Soloist with Large Group. In 1996, Columbia Records released a six-CD box set, <i>Miles Davis & Gil Evans</i>: <i>The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings</i>, that won the Grammy for Best Historical Album. <i>Quiet Nights</i> was preceded into the marketplace by Davis' next band effort, <i>Seven Steps to Heaven</i>, recorded in the spring of 1963 with an entirely new lineup consisting of saxophonist George Coleman, pianist Victor Feldman, bassist Ron Carter, and drummer Frank Butler. During the sessions, Feldman was replaced by Herbie Hancock and Butler by Tony Williams. The album found Davis making a transition to his next great group, of which Carter, Hancock, and Williams would be members. </p><p>It was another pop chart entry that earned 1963 Grammy nominations for both Best Instrumental Jazz Performance by a Soloist or Small Group and Best Instrumental Jazz Performance by a Large Group. The quintet followed with two live albums, <i>Miles Davis in Europe</i>, recorded in July 1963, which made the pop charts and earned a 1964 Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance by a Small Group or Soloist with Small Group, and <i>My Funny Valentine</i>, recorded in February 1964 and released in 1965, when it reached the pop charts. By September 1964, the final member of the classic Miles Davis Quintet of the 1960s was in place with the addition of saxophonist Wayne Shorter to the team of Davis, Carter, Hancock, and Williams. While continuing to play standards in concert, this unit embarked on a series of albums of original compositions contributed by the band members, starting in January 1965 with <i>E.S.P.</i>, followed by <i>Miles Smiles</i> (1967 Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance by a Small Group or Soloist with Small Group [7 or Fewer]), <i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>Nefertiti</i>, <i>Miles in the Sky</i> (1968 Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance by a Small Group or Soloist with Small Group), and <i>Filles de Kilimanjaro</i>. By the time of <i>Miles in the Sky</i>, the group had begun to turn to electric instruments, presaging Davis' next stylistic turn. By the final sessions for <i>Filles de Kilimanjaro</i> in September 1968, Hancock had been replaced by Chick Corea and Carter by Dave Holland. But Hancock, along with pianist Joe Zawinul and guitarist John McLaughlin, participated on Davis' next album, <i>In a Silent Way</i> (1969), which returned the trumpeter to the pop charts for the first time in four years and earned him another small-group jazz performance Grammy nomination. </p><p>With his next album, <i>Bitches Brew</i>, Davis turned more overtly to a jazz-rock style. Though certainly not conventional rock music, Davis' electrified sound attracted a young, non-jazz audience while putting off traditional jazz fans. <i>Bitches Brew</i>, released in March 1970, reached the pop Top 40 and became Davis' first album to be certified gold. It also earned a Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Arrangement and won the Grammy for large-group jazz performance. He followed it with such similar efforts as <i>Miles Davis at Fillmore East</i> (1971 Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Performance by a Group), <i>A Tribute to Jack Johnson</i>, <i>Live-Evil</i>, <i>On the Corner</i>, and <i>In Concert</i>, all of which reached the pop charts. Meanwhile, Davis' former sidemen became his disciples in a series of fusion groups: Corea formed Return to Forever, Shorter and Zawinul led Weather Report, and McLaughlin and former Davis drummer Billy Cobham organized the Mahavishnu Orchestra. Starting in October 1972, when he broke his ankles in a car accident, Davis became less active in the early '70s, and in 1975 he gave up recording entirely due to illness, undergoing surgery for hip replacement later in the year. </p><p>Five years passed before he returned to action by recording <i>The Man With the Horn</i> in 1980 and going back to touring in 1981. By now, he was an elder statesman of jazz, and his innovations had been incorporated into the music, at least by those who supported his eclectic approach. He was also a celebrity whose appeal extended far beyond the basic jazz audience. He performed on the worldwide jazz festival circuit and recorded a series of albums that made the pop charts, including <i>We Want Miles</i> (1982 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance by a Soloist), <i>Star People</i>, <i>Decoy</i>, and <i>You're Under Arrest</i>. In 1986, after 30 years with Columbia, he switched to Warner Bros. Records and released <i>Tutu</i>, which won him his fourth Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance. <i>Aura</i>, an album he had recorded in 1984, was released by Columbia in 1989 and brought him his fifth Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance by a Soloist (on a Jazz Recording). Davis surprised jazz fans when, on July 8, 1991, he joined an orchestra led by Quincy Jones at the Montreux Jazz Festival to perform some of the arrangements written for him in the late '50s by Gil Evans; he had never previously looked back at an aspect of his career. He died of pneumonia, respiratory failure, and a stroke within months. <i>Doo-Bop</i>, his last studio album, appeared in 1992. It was a collaboration with rapper Easy Mo Bee, and it won a Grammy for Best Rhythm & Blues Instrumental Performance, with the track ~Fantasy~ nominated for Best Jazz Instrumental Solo. Released in 1993, <i>Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux</i> won Davis his seventh Grammy for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Performance.</p><p>Miles Davis took an all-inclusive, constantly restless approach to jazz that had begun to fall out of favor by the time of his death, even as it earned him controversy during his lifetime. It was hard to recognize the bebop acolyte of Charlie Parker in the flamboyantly dressed leader with the hair extensions who seemed to keep one foot on a wah-wah pedal and one hand on an electric keyboard in his later years. But he did much to popularize jazz, reversing the trend away from commercial appeal that bebop began. And whatever the fripperies and explorations, he retained an ability to play moving solos that endeared him to audiences and demonstrated his affinity with tradition. At a time when jazz is inclining toward academia and repertory orchestras rather than moving forward, he is a reminder of the music's essential quality of boundless invention, using all available means.</p>&mdash; <b>William Ruhlmann</b>",

A primary consideration of these fruitful sessions is the caliber of musicians -- Miles Davis (trumpet), Red Garland (piano), John Coltrane (tenor sax), and Philly Joe Jones (drums) -- who were basically doing their stage act in the studio. As actively performing musicians, the material they are most intimate with would be their live repertoire. Likewise, what more obvious place than a studio is there to capture every inescapable audible nuance of the combo's musical group mind. The end results are consistently astonishing. At the center of Steamin', as with most outings by this band, are the group improvisations which consist of solo upon solo of arguably the sweetest and otherwise most swinging interactions known to have existed between musicians. ~Surrey With the Fringe on Top~ is passed between the mates like an old joke. Garland compliments threads started by Davis and Coltrane as their seamless interaction yields a stream of strikingly lyrical passages. There are two well-placed nods to fellow bop pioneers Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie on a revision of their ~Salt Peanuts.~ Philly Joe Jones' mimicking cymbal speak -- which replicates Gillespie's original vocals -- is nothing short of genius. This rendition is definitely as crazy and unpredictable here as the original. Thelonious Monk also gets kudos on ~Well, You Needn't.~ This quintet makes short work of the intricacies of the arrangement, adding the double horn lead on the choruses and ultimately redefining this jazz standard. Although there is no original material on Steamin', it may best represent the ability of the Miles Davis quintet to take standards and rebuild them to suit their qualifications.</p>&mdash; <b>Lindsay Planer</b>"

The title track was chosen because of its unique rendition with a muted trumpet, debuted at the Newport Jazz Festival the summer before to a thunderous reception.

Which he does with a gorgeous all-blues read of the tune utilizing first one hand and then both hands to create fat harmonic chords to bring Davis back in to close it out. It's breathtaking how seamless it all is. There's little else to say except that Round About Midnight is among the most essential of Davis' Columbia recordings.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek"

				"review": "<p>Cookin' is the first of four albums derived from the Miles Davis quintet's fabled extended recording session on October 26, 1956. The concept being that the band would document their vast live performance catalog in a studio environment, rather than preparing all new tracks for their upcoming long-player. The bounty of material in the band's live sets -- as well as the overwhelming conviction in the quintet's studio sides -- would produce the lions share of the Cookin', Relaxin', Workin', and Steamin' albums. As these recordings demonstrate, there is an undeniable telepathic cohesion that allows this band -- consisting of Miles Davis (trumpet), John Coltrane (tenor sax), Red Garland (piano), and Philly Joe Jones (drums) -- to work so efficiently both on the stage as well as in the studio. This same unifying force is also undoubtedly responsible for the extrasensory dimensions scattered throughout these recordings. The immediate yet somewhat understated ability of each musician to react with the ingenuity and precision is expressed in the consistency and singularity of each solo as it is maintained from one musician to the next without the slightest deviation. ~Blues By Five~ reveals the exceptional symmetry between Davis and Coltrane that allows them to complete each other's thoughts musically. Cookin' features the pairing of ~Tune Up/When Lights Are Low,~ which is without a doubt a highlight not only of this mammoth session, but also the entire tenure of Miles Davis mid-'50s quintet. All the elements converge upon this fundamentally swinging medley. Davis' pure-toned solos and the conversational banter that connects with Coltrane and later Garland during ~When the Lights Are Low~ resounds as one of the finest moments between these musicians.</p>— <b>Lindsay Planer</b>"

				"review": "<p>Relaxin' features the Miles Davis Quintet in a pair of legendary recording dates -- from May and October of 1956 -- which would generate enough music to produce four separate long-players: Cookin', Relaxin', Workin', and Steamin'. Each of these is considered not only to be among the pinnacle of Davis' work, but of the entire bop subgenre as well. As with the other titles, Relaxin' contains a variety of material which the band had concurrently been performing in their concert appearances. In a brilliant stroke of time conservation, the scheme was hatched for the quintet -- who includes: Davis (trumpet), John Coltrane (tenor sax), Philly Joe Jones (drums), and Red Garland (piano) -- to perform the equivalent of their live repertoire in the studio for eventual release. The results are consistently superior both in terms of song selection as well as performance. The solid nature of the unit as a singular musical force is immediately apparent. ~If I Were a Bell~ -- from the play Guys and Dolls -- includes some remarkable soloing via Coltrane and Garland. Davis' solos are additionally impressive, as they're derived from the same four-note motive as the melody. Hearing the many variations that he comes up with throughout the song conveys how intrigued Davis must have been by the tune, as it stayed in his performance repertoire for decades. Tracks such as ~You're My Everything~ and ~Oleo~ highlight the synchronic nature of Davis and Coltrane as they carry each other's melodies while trading off solos. The steady syncopation of Philly Joe Jones keeps the rhythms tight and the delicate interplay all the more conspicuous. Relaxin' offers something for every degree of jazz enthusiast. Likewise, the quintet's recordings provide a tremendous introduction for the curious jazz consumer.</p>&mdash; <b>Lindsay Planer</b>"

The fourth disc contains radio and television appearances which have never been released before. The first four tracks are from the Tonight Show in 1955, with Steve Allen as he gives two different spoken intros that are fine to hear once, but a drag after that (and one wonders what Miles must have thought of them), and result in two quintet performances, ~Max Is Making Wax (Chance It)~ by Oscar Pettiford and the standard ~It Never Entered My Mind.~ The six cuts are from different live shows from radio broadcasts of live gigs at the Blue Note in Philadelphia in 1956 and the Café Bohemia in New York in 1958. There are two performances of ~Walkin,~ one each of ~Four,~ ~Bye Bye Blackbird,~ and Dizzy Gillespie's ~Two Bass Hit.~ In addition, the second portion of disc four is enhanced and contains Miles solo transcriptions that are suitable for printing, two of ~Tune Up~ (the original version and the one from the Blue Note gig), and ~Four~ (both the original studio version and one from Café Bohemia). There is also a transcription of the solo played during ~Max Is Making Wax (Chance It)~ from the Tonight Show. There is a longbox booklet with a solid essay by Bob Blumenthal and it's full of groovy black-and-white photos. Miles freaks -- and trumpet players, perhaps -- will have to have this, one supposes. But as real bonus material designed to get you to buy the original recordings over again, or unless you're an an audiophile, it's rather difficult to discern the upgraded quality of sound, and seems rather pointless.

A primary consideration of these fruitful sessions is the caliber of musicians -- Miles Davis (trumpet), Red Garland (piano), John Coltrane (tenor sax), and Philly Joe Jones (drums) -- who were basically doing their stage act in the studio. As actively performing musicians, the material they are most intimate with would be their live repertoire. Likewise, what more obvious place than a studio is there to capture every inescapable audible nuance of the combo's musical group mind. The end results are consistently astonishing. At the center of Steamin', as with most outings by this band, are the group improvisations which consist of solo upon solo of arguably the sweetest and otherwise most swinging interactions known to have existed between musicians. ~Surrey With the Fringe on Top~ is passed between the mates like an old joke. Garland compliments threads started by Davis and Coltrane as their seamless interaction yields a stream of strikingly lyrical passages. There are two well-placed nods to fellow bop pioneers Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie on a revision of their ~Salt Peanuts.~ Philly Joe Jones' mimicking cymbal speak -- which replicates Gillespie's original vocals -- is nothing short of genius. This rendition is definitely as crazy and unpredictable here as the original. Thelonious Monk also gets kudos on ~Well, You Needn't.~ This quintet makes short work of the intricacies of the arrangement, adding the double horn lead on the choruses and ultimately redefining this jazz standard. Although there is no original material on Steamin', it may best represent the ability of the Miles Davis quintet to take standards and rebuild them to suit their qualifications.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Back in 1958, Jazz at the Plaza was never meant to be a record; it was a Columbia party at the Plaza, a place jazz had never been played before. Also on the bill were Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, and Jimmy Rushing. Despite the fine remastering job done by the Sony crew, Jazz at the Plaza remains more a curiosity piece than an essential recording by a remarkable band, strictly because of its dodgy recording quality. The 40-minute set is plagued by the problem of barely being able to hear Davis in places, particularly on the stellar opener, ~If I Were a Bell,~ and Evans is all but absent on much of the record. In fact, there is no mix; it's just a flat-out two- or three-mike set. That said, the performance is far from dodgy. There are four tunes in the set: the previously mentioned old stripe from Guys and Dolls; ~Oleo,~ played at a blistering tempo; ~My Funny Valentine,~ which, although recorded by Davis' previous quintet for Prestige, had become a staple in the sextet's play book; and Monk's ~Straight, No Chaser.~ It is perhaps the last that brings the sextet to full bloom in this performance. Davis plays the theme faster than normal, alternating the groove between full and cut time, and Bill Evans goes directly to quoting ~Blue Monk~ in his own solo. Also notable is the performance of ~My Funny Valentine~ without the saxophone giants John Coltrane or Cannonball Adderley. But here, again, given the recording quality, it just feels like they weren't miked -- the audience is louder than the band on most of this. Nonetheless, Davis had turned the tune inside out by this time and was playing it in his new modal style; the melody became a skeleton and was replaced by the ghosts of intervals that kept its integrity and made it recognizable. This is not to say Davis had abandoned melody for mode entirely because his melodic sensibility, which was instinctual, is what made the modalism on the sextet level possible in the first place. Ultimately, Jazz at the Plaza succeeds mightily on the level of its fine performance, but is for hardcore jazz fans only, due to its dubious sound quality.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>What is immediately noticeable upon listening to this delicately and superbly remastered version of Miles Davis classic first — and only — album with his original sextet is how deep the blues presence is on it. Though it is true that the album's title cut is rightfully credited with introducing modalism into jazz, and defining Davis' music for years to come, it is the sole selection of its kind on the record. The rest is all blues in any flavor you wish you call your own. For starters, there's the steaming bebop blues of ~Dr. Jackie~ — recorded in 1955 for a Prestige session with Jackie McLean. Davis is still in his role as a trumpet master, showing a muscularity of tone that reveals something more akin to Roy Eldridge or Louis Armstrong than Dizzy or Fats Navarro. The tempo is furious as all the members of the sextet solo except for Jones. The saxophonists trade choruses and come off sounding like mirrored images of one another in the slower, post-bop blues that is ~Sid's Ahead.~ With a slippery melody line that quotes two harmonic lines from early New Orleans-styled blues, Davis drives the band into the rhythm section's garage. It's Cannonball first with his stuttered, angular lines, hiccuping halfway through the interval before continuing on with a squeak here and the slightest squawk there. Next up is Davis, blowing fluid and straightened lines, ribbons through the rhythm section's center as Red Garland lays out and leaves it to Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones to provide the earnest, time-keeping 4/4 that Davis sidles to in the tune. When Coltrane solos, all best are off as he plays as pure a blues as he was capable at the time. Nonetheless, there are the long lines of slurred notes, smattered against Garland's harmonies and he slips into quoting ~Skip to my Lou~ before knotting it back down to the basics and even then not for long. Coltrane was already exploring the edges of mode and harmony; he used an intervallic invention in the choruses to juxtapose his solo against the rhythm section and it worked — but it must have made Davis raise an eyebrow. Chambers' solo is as tasteful and as breezy and free as only he could be. His contrapuntal soloing rides the rhythm out, Garland striding along quietly until the tune returns.</p><p>~Sid's Ahead~ is followed by the track ~Two Bass Hit,~ written by Dizzy and John Lewis. It's an off-kilter blues with a wide middle section, no doubt for Lewis' piano to fill. It's a wonderful ensemble showcase but Davis blows his ass off in his solo, riding through the two saxophonists and challenging them at the same time. But then comes ~Milestones~ with its modal round and interval, where harmony is constructed from the center up. It is a memorable tune for not only its structure and how it would inform not only Davis' own music, but jazz in general for the next seven years. It would also change John Coltrane's life. The exploratory style of soloing was already revealing itself in Trane's playing, but he loosens it up even more here. More importantly, this is the first place we get to see it in Davis, where there is no goal at the end of the rainbow, there is merely the solo itself in the heart of the mode. The alternate take of this tune, which is featured at the end of the album, tagged on with two others of ~Two Bass Hit~ and ~Straight, No Chaser,~ has an even longer and weirder solo by Davis where he plays notes he probably never played again. The album's closer is Monk's ~Straight, No Chaser,~ which became a signature tune for the sextet even when Garland and Jones left to be replaced by Bill Evans and Jimmy Cobb and later Evans by Wynton Kelly. Like ~My Funny Valentine,~ it was a Davis staple that accented how intuitive the band was with unusual harmonic structures like Monk's. The Adderley solo is remarkable for its fluid, bebop-style runs over Garland's extended chords and flatted sevenths. Cannonball quotes the melody in a myriad of ways and goes off the deep end each time he does, taking the new rendition to its limit, always returning it to the blues root. Davis plays it cool, slithering around the rhythm section staying firmly in blues phraseology, even quoting a reverse harmonic melodic read of ~When the Saints Go Marching In,~ bringing it in and out three times while pushing the blues line to its edge. Coltrane's solo is all over the place, slurring notes as he plays weird scales all over the blues and triple times the rhythm section. But he knows the tune better than anyone here — he spent six months with Monk just previous to this playing it every night. Coltrane knows how much he can stretch the intervals without breaking apart the body. He inserts his own modal interpretation on the blues halfway through his solo before slipping into the straight, swinging groove of his Blue Train album, finished only two months before. Garland, oddly enough, is the one to travel the furthest from Monk here, coming off with a Bud Powell-esque blues muscle that shifts the entire tune into a straight bebop blues before sifting in a few Errol Garland quotes as the bass solos and then the front line comes in to take it out. The alternate take is even stranger as Garland falters in his time not once but twice and has to find his way back in.</p><p>Legacy has done it proud on this series of reissues, as the sound is as fine as technology can currently make it, the notes are terrific, and the alternate takes offer additional delights to fans of the original recordings. They should also be commended for leaving them at the bottom of the album instead of placing them in with the original album's sequence, a practice that though widely used is distracting nonetheless. This is a fine issue of a classic, and treated like the piece of art it is.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

The three-week European tour was part of the Jazz at the Philharmonic series produced by George Wein. Accounts from Davis and drummer Jimmy Cobb claim certifiable tension surrounding John Coltrane. He left the band at the end of 1959 and reportedly had to be talked (hard) into taking the gig by Davis. It was the trumpeter's first European tour as an international jazz star, and the band -- with Cobb, pianist Wynton Kelly, and bassist Paul Chambers were among the cats who recorded 1959's Kind of Blue.</p><p>From the opening moments of ~All of You~ in the first Paris show, it's obvious that what's happening on-stage wasn't planned.

The lengthy solo by the saxophonist greets the changes with dissonance, sharp angles, and a (then) atypical fury as he tries out new sounds, fingerings, and breathing techniques. Kelly brings it back inside with his own solo, light, fleet, expert, and swinging. ~All of You~ is followed by a blazing 13-minute ~So What,~ offered with the illuminating contrast that would underscore the tour: The reinvention of standards from the '40s and '50s with more open, less melodic modal jazz epitomized by the Kind of Blue material. In the first version of ~All Blues,~ Davis follows Chambers and Kelly by adding more physicality to his own playing without sacrificing his lyric invention. It foreshadows Coltrane's wailing solo full of multiphonics, honks, and banks of layered scales that wove together East and West. The short reading of the bop standard ~Oleo~ is the only place in either of the Paris concerts where the saxophonist reigns himself in. ~All Blues~ from Copenhagen is also faster. Chambers' short solo intro is picked up by Kelly's fat vamp and Cobb's stutter-step beat before Davis takes the lean melody and stretches it, opening a door for Coltrane, who commences slowly before breaking its structure wide open. Once more, it's Kelly's grooving solo with glorious right-hand flourishes that brings the hard swing back to the equation. All the music here is filled with these moments. The decision to rework the standards in order to make room for more openness was wise and all one needs to do is check the three versions of ~On Green Dolphin Street~ here for evidence. Interestingly, while the tour established Davis' international rep for good, it was Coltrane who benefitted most from the tour -- he was all but unknown before it, and unforgettable after. The tape sources are all official: The Copenhagen gig is remastered from a state radio broadcast and the other two concerts are from producers' archives, making this historic set among the most essential in the Bootleg Series.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

There are two other songs (~All of You~ and ~Four~ supposedly played by the same group but actually dating from Sept. 1957 and featuring Davis with Bobby Jaspar on tenor, pianist Tommy Flanagan, Chamber and Jones.

Davis is not present (the trumpeter might be Nat Adderley or Art Farmer ) but one can hear baritonist Gerry Mulligan, trombonist Bennie Green and percusionist Candido.

				"review": "<p>Sorcerer, the third album by the second Miles Davis Quintet, is in a sense a transitional album, a quiet, subdued affair that rarely blows hot, choosing to explore cerebral tonal colorings. Even when the tempo picks up, as it does on the title track, there's little of the dense, manic energy on Miles Smiles -- this is about subtle shadings, even when the compositions are as memorable as Tony Williams' ~Pee Wee~ or Herbie Hancock's ~Sorcerer.~ As such, it's a little elusive, since it represents the deepening of the band's music as they choose to explore different territory. The emphasis is as much on complex, interweaving chords and a coolly relaxed sound as it is on sheer improvisation, though each member tears off thoroughly compelling solos. Still, the individual flights aren't placed at the forefront the way they were on the two predecessors -- it all merges together, pointing toward the dense soundscapes of Miles' later '60s work. It's such a layered, intriguing work that the final cut, recorded in 1962 with Bob Dorough on vocals, is an utterly jarring, inappropriate way to end the record, even if it's intended as a tribute to Miles' then-wife, Cicely Tyson (whose image graces the cover).</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<p>With the 1968 album Miles in the Sky, Miles Davis explicitly pushed his second great quintet away from conventional jazz, pushing them toward the jazz-rock hybrid that would later become known as fusion. Here, the music is still in its formative stages, and it's a little more earth-bound than you might expect, especially following on the heels of the shape-shifting, elusive Nefertiti. On Miles in the Sky, much of the rhythms are straightforward, picking up on the direct 4/4 beats of rock, and these are illuminated by Herbie Hancock's electric piano -- one of the very first sounds on the record, as a matter of fact -- and the guest appearance of guitarist George Benson on ~Paraphernalia.~ All of these additions are tangible and identifiable, and they do result in intriguing music, but the form of the music itself is surprisingly direct, playing as extended grooves. This meanders considerable more than Nefertiti, even if it is significantly less elliptical in its form, because it's primarily four long jams. Intriguing, successful jams in many respects, but even with the notable additions of electric instruments, and with the deliberately noisy ~Country Son,~ this is less visionary than its predecessor and feels like a transitional album -- and, like many transitional albums, it's intriguing and frustrating in equal measures.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Thought by many to be among the most revolutionary albums in jazz history, Miles Davis' Bitches Brew solidified the genre known as jazz-rock fusion. It being the jazz album to most influence jazz, rock, and funk musicians after 1970, by its very nature it is legend. The original double LP included only six cuts and featured up to 12 musicians at any given time, some of whom were already established while others would become high-profile players later: Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, Airto, John McLaughlin, Chick Corea, Jack DeJohnette, Dave Holland, Don Alias, Bennie Maupin, Larry Young, and Lenny White among them.</p><p>Originally thought to be a series of long jams locked into grooves around keyboard, bass, or guitar vamps, Bitches Brew is actually a recording that producer Teo Macero assembled from various jams by razor-blade: splice to splice and section to section. ~Pharaoh's Dance~ opens the set with its slippery trumpet lines and McLaughlin's snaky guitar figures skirting the edge of the rhythm section, as Alias' conga slipping through the middle. Corea's and Zawinul's keyboards create a haunted, riffing modal groove, echoed and accented by the basses of Harvey Brooks and Holland. The title cut was originally composed as a five-part suite, though only three were used. Here the keyboards punch through the mix, big chords ring up distorted harmonics for Davis to solo rhythmically over, outside the mode. McLaughlin comps with a vamp, and the bass and drums carry the rest. It's a small taste of the deep voodoo funk to appear on Davis' later records. Side three opens with McLaughlin and Davis trading fours and eights over a lock-step hypnotic vamp on ~Spanish Key.~ Zawinul's trademark lyric sensibility provides a near-chorus for Corea to flit around in; the congas and drummers juxtapose themselves against the basslines. It neatly segues into the brief ~John McLaughlin,~ featuring an organ playing modes below arpeggiated blues guitar runs. The end of Bitches Brew, signified by the stellar ~Miles Runs the Voodoo Down,~ reflects the influence of Jimi Hendrix with its chunky slipped chords and Davis playing a ghostly melody through the shimmering funkiness of the rhythm section. It seemingly dances, becoming increasingly more chaotic until it nearly disintegrates before shimmering into a loose, foggy nadir. The disc closes with ~Sanctuary,~ completely redone here as a moody electric ballad, reworked for this band, but it keeps enough of its integrity to be recognizable. Bitches Brew is so forward thinking, it retains its freshness and mystery in the 21st century. [Sony Legacy's 40th Anniversary Edition contains three CDs and a DVD. These remasters from the original eight-track tapes contain two newly discovered and previously unreleased alternate takes of ~Spanish Key~ and ~John McLaughlin.~ Also included are the 45 edits of ~Miles Runs the Voodoo Down,~ ~Spanish Key,~ ~Great Expectations,~ and ~Little Blue Frog.~ The 71-minute DVD called Copenhagen Live 1969, includes a complete performance by a quintet that includes Shorter, Corea, Holland, and DeJohnette, three months prior to the release of Bitches Brew. The arrangements of the album's tunes are scaled down, and the playing is freer, further outside than the recordings. In addition, some of Davis' previous quintet numbers are given some eclectic, electric treatments, including ~I Fall in Love Too Easily,~ ~Directions,~ and ~Agitation.~ The DVD's quality is sonically fine, though visually a bit grainy around the edges, though it doesn't hinder the enjoyment at all. The booklet comes with an excellent new liner essay by Greg Tate that takes a completely different cultural tact compared to Legacy's other Davis reissues.]</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

If one listens to Joe Zawinul's original version of ~In a Silent Way,~ it comes across as almost a folk song with a very pronounced melody. The version Miles Davis and Teo Macero assembled from the recording session in July of 1968 is anything but. There is no melody, not even a melodic frame. There are only vamps and solos, grooves layered on top of other grooves spiraling toward space but ending in silence. But even these don't begin until almost ten minutes into the piece. It's Miles and McLaughlin, sparely breathing and wending their way through a series of seemingly disconnected phrases until the groove monster kicks in. The solos are extended, digging deep into the heart of the ethereal groove, which was dark, smoky, and ashen. McLaughlin and Hancock are particularly brilliant, but Corea's solo on the Fender Rhodes is one of his most articulate and spiraling on the instrument ever. The A-side of the album, ~Shhh/Peaceful,~ is even more so. With Tony Williams shimmering away on the cymbals in double time, Miles comes out slippery and slowly, playing over the top of the vamp, playing ostinato and moving off into more mysterious territory a moment at a time. With Zawinul's organ in the background offering the occasional swell of darkness and dimension, Miles could continue indefinitely. But McLaughlin is hovering, easing in, moving up against the organ and the trills by Hancock and Corea; Wayne Shorter hesitantly winds in and out of the mix on his soprano, filling space until it's his turn to solo. But John McLaughlin, playing solos and fills throughout (the piece is like one long dreamy solo for the guitarist), is what gives it its open quality, like a piece of music with no borders as he turns in and through the commingling keyboards as Holland paces everything along. When the first round of solos ends, Zawinul and McLaughlin and Williams usher it back in with painterly decoration and illumination from Corea and Hancock. Miles picks up on another riff created by Corea and slips in to bring back the ostinato ~theme~ of the work. He plays glissando right near the very end, which is the only place where the band swells and the tune moves above a whisper before Zawinul's organ fades it into silence. This disc holds up, and perhaps is even stronger because of the issue of the complete sessions. It is, along with Jack Johnson and Bitches Brew, a signature Miles Davis session from the electric era.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Of all the recording sessions completed by Miles Davis with his various bands, the sessions surrounding In a Silent Way Sessions in 1968 and 1969 are easily the most mysterious and enigmatic. For starters, they signified the completion of his transformation from acoustic to electric sound, and secondly, they marked the complete dissolution of the ~second~ quintet of Davis, Herbie Hancock, Tony Williams, Wayne Shorter, and Ron Carter that had begun on Filles de Kilimanjaro. The addition of Chick Corea as a second keyboard player and the replacement of Ron Carter with Dave Holland had changed the sound of the band's dynamic, textural, and rhythmic palettes. The final break with Davis' own previous musical sound happened when he added guitarist John McLaughlin and keyboardist/composer Joe Zawinul (for a temporary three-keyboard sound). The music on the In a Silent Way Sessions comes packaged three ways, all of it chronologically ordered: there is the material used to finish Filles de Kilimanjaro (~Mademoiselle Maby~ and ~Freon Brun~); material that has been, up until now, unissued in any form; session outtakes that appeared, in edited form, on Circle in the Round, Water Babies, and Directions; unissued and rejected takes; and finally, the music recorded for In a Silent Way itself as it was rehearsed, played, and finally, heavily edited into the released album, which also appears here.</p><p>This was an ambitious undertaking, even if it only covered six months in the recording life of Davis (September 1968 through February 1969), whose musical inspirations and directions were crisscrossing as they were changing direction. With the exception of one tune, Davis or Zawinul composed everything here. Zawinul, though a jazz veteran, was discovering new ways to write — particularly since the advent of the electric piano — and proved to be a profound influence on his employer. The other heavy influence on Davis during this volatile, fertile period was Tony Williams, who was soaking up the pop music of the day, from the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's album (via a girlfriend's suggestion) to the in-his-prime James Brown, to Jimi Hendrix. On Disc One, the set begins with the missing tracks from the quintet box set: ~Mademoiselle Mabry~ and ~Frelon Brun.~ Hearing them in this context, as the first complete expressions of Davis' new sound, is revelatory. For the first time the three-chord vamp in ~Mademoiselle Mabry~ comes across as the fitting tribute to Hendrix it should have been, echoing the turnaround tags in ~The Wind Cries Mary.~ These tracks mark the entrance of Dave Holland into the band and the first marked absence of Hancock. The contrast in styles, from Hancock's chunky, groove-laden chords and single-note runs and Corea's deep, cerebral spaciousness, is remarkable; it's a wonder they were issued on the same record at all. The simple, slow-jam riff the former tune evokes was, in some way, the cornerstone on which the material for these sessions would be built, while the latter provided the space and pace for its establishment.</p><p>The elegantly spaced-out ~Two Faced~ and ~Dual Mr. Anthony Tillmon Williams Process~ were recorded as a sextet with Hancock. Both tunes are a showcase for the interplay between both keyboardists and Holland, whose near-mystical lyricism was exactly what Davis was looking for in a bass player — one who could change the role of the instrument in an ensemble setting. The loose-jam feeling on these tunes could be heard by some as meandering, but it would be shortsighted to assume this for the entire picture. The various extrapolations on blues-feel and meter — moving them into modal settings and then deconstructing these for a streamlined, open music that allowed for both improvisation and direct musical interplay between various members — were integral and created in Davis' music a space that changed jazz forever. Disc One ends with the full version of ~Splash~ that appeared on Circle in the Round. Here, all of its four interludes are included after the unedited version of the tune. All of the interludes were recorded as scripted fragments with no improvisation, and featured Hancock playing electric harpsichord and Corea on organ. Lastly there is ~Splashdown,~ the first Davis recording that features Zawinul and the three-keyboard lineup. Here too, the track was unissued, and one has to wonder why, because the dialogue between the three principals, and Holland and Williams, is remarkable — Davis is all but absent, but it hardly matters as Shorter covers his territory well. With two electric pianos and an organ, the tune is so psychedelic and fat; full of a kind of inherent funkiness brought by the rhythm section, and Shorter underscores the jazz element in his solo by taking two cues from Coltrane and turning them into modal paragraphs. Both interludes that follow the tune were also rejected.</p><p>Disc Two is where the In a Silent Way project begins in earnest. The next set is from the album issued in 1981 as Directions. The three tracks that comprise it reveal just how far Davis was willing to take the massive keyboard section. With slow, drifting, methodical improvisation concerned more with the development of sound and texture than riffs and intervals, the Davis group drifts through ~Ascent,~ with Zawinul keeping the color hushed and silvery as Hancock improvises and Corea plays a series of modulated, though very subtle, changes. The most noticeable change is on the driving ~Directions,~ both Pieces One and Two. Williams has been replaced, for this session at least, with Jack DeJohnette, and the driving, slippery force of DeJohnette's drumming with Shorter's precisely punctuated soprano solo is overwhelming in its glorious intensity. These are both unedited takes, recorded as they happened without studio trickery from Teo Macero. The second take is slower, more defined; the intimate speech that developed between Shorter and Zawinul here offers a first glimpse of the sound that would be the genesis of Weather Report a little over a year later. For the time being, largely due to the intuitive improvisation of DeJohnette's drumming, the sound of ~Directions~ was a rock sound with wild intervalic fanfare and slippery rhythms shifting under the explosive interplay between soloists and ensemble. From the middle to the end of Disc Two, the In a Silent Way project begins to take shape. The first version of ~Shhh/Peaceful~ rings with the presence of John McLaughlin's guitar. The first version is a bit faster from the jump than the one released later — and heavily edited. There is no chord structure to the tune; there's just a small groove figure with solo vamps appearing all over it. The bassline is doubled by Corea's electric piano; Hancock's silky piano accompaniment fills in the shapes. The hi-hat and McLaughlin's guitar shimmer colors and nuances as Davis enters with the only solo he could play to such beautiful accompaniment. There is an accented chordal passageway from the middle to the end where Zawinul enters, creating a series of overtones with his organ that lend a spectral, eerie presence to the proceedings. It dissolves eventually, only to give way to the intro to Zawinul's gorgeous ~In a Silent Way/It's About That Time.~ The rehearsal version has a ton of chords compared to the way it was written; they were added as coloration devices to involve the instrumentalists in a deeper way. First, there is the reductionism of McLaughlin playing the melody in just one chord, and then Davis and Shorter enter to play over the Rhodes and doubled bassline. When the early recorded versions are set in place, and McLaughlin opens the tune, you can feel how much the tune has developed from the rehearsal tape. The pace is tortoise-like; everything is gone from the mix, and there's just that guitar with Zawinul eventually adding his organ and Hancock slinking his piano into the intervals. When the band does enter, it's via Shorter's sweet, singing soprano rather than Davis' trumpet. It's reduced to essence as a melodic frame with no foundation to hook onto, as transitory and elegant as it is beautiful. The suspended vamp that begins ~It's About That Time~ is a floating one; it never anchors itself to either E or F sharp. Hancock offers the chords and Corea and Zawinul join him, playing shifting, ghostly fills before McLaughlin jumps in and doubles the keyboards sleepily with a bluesy graciousness. The piece was recorded in sections, so everything heard here has an illusory quality to it, because Macero edited it all into one tune. Solos and density structures mark the individual takes; Hancock and McLaughlin deconstruct tonalities in favor of sound, creating overtonal ambiences. The rest of the set offers finished, wonderfully remastered versions of both ~In a Silent Way/It's About That Time~ and ~Shhh/Peaceful~: those that appeared on the original LP.</p><p>Bob Belden's revealing, insightful, and authoritative liner notes tell the fascinating story of how the recorded tracks were edited into final versions; so no need to go into it here. But the two other tracks recorded with the same band minus Tony Williams — replaced by Joe Chambers, of all people — are both unissued: ~The Ghetto Walk~ and ~Early Minor.~ Both are deeply Hendrix-influenced, using his choice of keys and a series of sevenths around E flat, B flat, and A flat, and finally shifting themselves, in transmuted form, to the big daddy of all rock keys, E. Both of these tracks, filled with space, blues, rock, and killer piano and organ fills, are rhythmically carried by Holland and danced through the pocket by Chambers, who, while not as muscular as either Williams or DeJohnette, was more nuanced as a blues player, which is what these two awesome numbers called for, as they turned out to be — especially ~Ghetto Walk~ — the precursors to the material that would be recorded for Jack Johnson a year later. There is nothing extra in this set in terms of fluff, viscera, or detritus. All of the material included from these sessions offers perhaps the most fascinating look to date into the musical mind of Miles Davis, who was undergoing a revolution of his own — he looked to the younger players for inspiration and guidance in how to handle the new forms; the liner notes bear this atypical personification out. Each track is an audible step in that development, and a step toward the goal of what would be the first Miles Davis ~groove~ album — not in the Blue Note sense of the vernacular — one of atmosphere and ambience and texture and drift — not of melodies and changes. The package is handsome and well-illustrated to be sure, but the music alone is worth the package price. In many ways — far more so than the Bitches Brew sessions — this is the long-sought key that unlocks the door to the room that has the answers as to why and how Davis made such a complete break with his own music on In a Silent Way — a music which he never returned to — at least on record. It's the first box set in a long time that's been worth playing from beginning to end. [This set was reissued in 2004 with different packaging.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Thought by many to be among the most revolutionary albums in jazz history, Miles Davis' Bitches Brew solidified the genre known as jazz-rock fusion. The original double LP included only six cuts and featured up to 12 musicians at any given time, some of whom were already established while others would become high-profile players later, Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, Airto, John McLaughlin, Chick Corea, Jack DeJohnette, Dave Holland, Don Alias, Bennie Maupin, Larry Young, and Lenny White among them. Originally thought to be a series of long jams locked into grooves around keyboard, bass, or guitar vamps, Bitches Brew is actually a recording that producer Teo Macero assembled from various jams and takes by razor blade, splice to splice, section to section. ~Pharaoh's Dance~ opens the set with its slippery trumpet lines, McLaughlin's snaky guitar figures skirting the edge of the rhythm section and Don Alias' conga slipping through the middle. Corea and Zawinul's keyboards create a haunted, riffing modal groove, echoed and accented by the basses of Harvey Brooks and Holland. The title cut was originally composed as a five-part suite, though only three were used. Here the keyboards punch through the mix and big chords ring up distorted harmonics for Davis to solo rhythmically over, outside the mode. McLaughlin's comping creates a vamp, and the bass and drums carry the rest. It's a small taste of the deep voodoo funk to appear on Davis' later records. Side three opens with McLaughlin and Davis trading fours and eights over a lockstep hypnotic vamp on ~Spanish Key.~ Zawinul's lyric sensibility provides a near chorus for Corea to flit around in; the congas and drummers juxtapose themselves against the basslines. It nearly segues into the brief ~John McLaughlin,~ featuring an organ playing modes below arpeggiated blues guitar runs. The end of Bitches Brew, signified by the stellar ~Miles Runs the Voodoo Down,~ reflects the influence of Jimi Hendrix with its chunky, slipped chords and Davis playing a ghostly melody through the funkiness of the rhythm section. It seemingly dances, becoming increasingly more chaotic until it nearly disintegrates before shimmering into a loose foggy nadir. The disc closes with ~Sanctuary,~ completely redone here as a moody electric ballad that was reworked for this band while keeping enough of its integrity to be recognizable. Bitches Brew is so forward-thinking that it retains its freshness and mystery in the 21st century.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Until now, the official recordings of Miles Davis' performances at the Fillmore East between June 17 and 20, 1970 have been limited to Miles at the Fillmore, released as a double-disc. That album's producer Teo Macero edited the recordings to create medleys of each night's music to four 20-minute selections. This four-disc set contains the full concerts. There are 100 minutes of previously unreleased music from Wednesday through Saturday, and an additional 35 minutes of unreleased music from a previous gig at the Fillmore West.</p><p>These concerts featured the Davis band opening for songwriter Laura Nyro. Bill Graham regularly booked jazz acts to play on bills with rock and pop acts. The rock-pop context is significant because Davis was actively courting that audience -- aided not only by Graham but by FM DJs playing the just-released Bitches Brew. The band -- saxophonist Steve Grossman, Dave Holland on electric bass, drummer Jack DeJohnette, percussionist Airto Moreira, Chick Corea on electric piano, and Keith Jarrett on organ -- was loud and driving, and its sound was drenched in wah-wah pedals; distortion was employed when necessary. Both keyboardists played in the group for only three months. The program for each evening was basically the same: ~Directions,~ ~The Mask,~ ~It's About That Time,~ ~Bitches Brew,~ and ~The Theme.~ But each disc offers a different bonus: an encore, an unexpected performance, or tracks from the Fillmore West.</p><p>The charts are loose but focused, and the group's improvisational dynamic is breathtaking and entirely different each night. Davis is exceptionally strong. His playing is inventive, full of questions and muscular statements. Some notable solos occur on Wednesday's ~It's About That Time,~ the Fillmore West's ~Footprints~ and ~Paraphernalia,~ and the searing intensity displayed on ~Directions,~ from Friday. Grossman's soprano playing is stunning on each version of ~Bitches Brew~; his bluesy tenor playing is at its best on Thursday's ~Spanish Key.~ Individually and collectively, DeJohnette and Holland add an extreme funkiness to the band's bottom. Their interplay is canny, full of unlikely yet nasty grooves -- check Thursday's ~The Mask,~ or the throbbing pulse and roiling breaks on Friday's ~Directions.~ Jarrett's colors, textures, and stabs add an entirely different dimension to the band's attack. Check the spooky, sinister vamping and soloing on ~Miles Runs the Voodoo Down~ from the Fillmore West. Corea is alternately knotty and atmospheric. He can push the horns hard -- listen to Thursday's ~Directions~ -- or paint through Jarrett's wah-wah organ with an expressionist brush -- as on Saturday's ~Willie Nelson~ -- and his solos are risky. Airto's vocal and percussion arsenal is wildly different, not only from tune to tune, but night to night!</p><p>The sound here is fantastic: balanced and detailed. The box includes a 28-page booklet with an essay by Michael Cuscuna and producer's notes with Richard Seidel, along with rare photographs and a poster. Miles at the Fillmore - Miles Davis 1970: The Bootleg Series, Vol. 3 is an essential addition to the Davis canon.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Columbia's continuing summation of the career of Miles Davis through lavish box-set reissues resumed in 1998 with The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions, a four-disc set including all the music from the original 1970 double-album Bitches Brew plus over two additional hours of music from the six-month period during which the album was recorded. (Some of those tracks were previously released on compilations like Big Fun and Circle in the Round, but almost one-third of the material lay unissued until this release.) The music is simply fabulous -- the simultaneous birth and peak of jazz-rock/fusion, with a host of major players (John McLaughlin, Chick Corea, Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, Jack DeJohnette) and many innovations. There is a bit more evidence of tape hiss than in Columbia's last American remastering of the album, but the revelations of depth and timbre more than make up for it. Though the unreleased selections are distinctly inferior to those released on Bitches Brew, ~Yaphet,~ ~Corrado,~ and ~Trevere~ are intriguing jam sessions that reveal much about the creative process between Davis and producer Teo Macero during recording. Unlike Columbia's previous sets in the series (one treating Miles' period of collaboration with Gil Evans and one featuring the music of his second classic quintet), the Bitches Brew sessions lend themselves well to a box set of this type -- presenting the music in chronological order does no harm to original LP configurations as it did on previous sets, and the music here is another glowing testament to Miles' importance to the development of jazz in 1969, as in 1949.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>John Bush</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>None of Miles Davis' recordings has been more shrouded in mystery than Jack Johnson, yet none has better fulfilled Miles Davis' promise that he could form the ~greatest rock band you ever heard.~ Containing only two tracks, the album was assembled out of no less than four recording sessions between February 18, 1970, and June 4, 1970, and was patched together by producer Teo Macero. Most of the outtake material ended up on Directions, Big Fun, and elsewhere. The first misconception is the lineup: the credits on the recording are incomplete. For the opener, ~Right Off,~ the band is Miles, John McLaughlin, Billy Cobham, Herbie Hancock, Michael Henderson, and Steve Grossman (no piano player!), which reflects the liner notes. This was from the musicians' point of view, in a single take, recorded as McLaughlin began riffing in the studio while waiting for Miles; it was picked up on by Henderson and Cobham, Hancock was ushered in to jump on a Hammond organ (he was passing through the building), and Miles rushed in at 2:19 and proceeded to play one of the longest, funkiest, knottiest, and most complex solos of his career. Seldom has he cut loose like that and played in the high register with such a full sound. In the meantime, the interplay between Cobham, McLaughlin, and Henderson is out of the box, McLaughlin playing long, angular chords centering around E. This was funky, dirty rock & roll jazz. There is this groove that gets nastier and nastier as the track carries on, and never quits, though there are insertions by Macero of two Miles takes on Sly Stone tunes and an ambient textured section before the band comes back with the groove, fires it up again, and carries it out. On ~Yesternow,~ the case is far more complex. There are two lineups, the one mentioned above, and one that begins at about 12:55. The second lineup was Miles, McLaughlin, Jack DeJohnette, Chick Corea, Bennie Maupin, Dave Holland, and Sonny Sharrock. The first 12 minutes of the tune revolve around a single bass riff lifted from James Brown's ~Say It Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud.~ The material that eases the first half of the tune into the second is taken from ~Shhh/Peaceful,~ from In a Silent Way, overdubbed with the same trumpet solo that is in the ambient section of ~Right Off.~ It gets more complex as the original lineup is dubbed back in with a section from Miles' tune ~Willie Nelson,~ another part of the ambient section of ~Right Off,~ and an orchestral bit of ~The Man Nobody Saw~ at 23:52, before the voice of Jack Johnson (by actor Brock Peters) takes the piece out. The highly textured, nearly pastoral ambience at the end of the album is a fitting coda to the chilling, overall high-energy rockist stance of the album. Jack Johnson is the purest electric jazz record ever made because of the feeling of spontaneity and freedom it evokes in the listener, for the stellar and inspiring solos by McLaughlin and Davis that blur all edges between the two musics, and for the tireless perfection of the studio assemblage by Miles and producer Macero. [The album was completely remastered and reissued in January of 2005, following the 2003 release of the Complete Jack Johnson Sessions box set by Legacy.]</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Of all the Miles Davis recordings, the 16 weeks of sessions that created a single, two-selection LP produced by Teo Macero called A Tribute to Jack Johnson have been the most apocryphal. While the album itself was a confounding obscurity upon release — due to its closeness in proximity to the nearly simultaneous release of the vastly inferior yet infinitely more label-promoted Live at the Fillmore East — its reputation as the first complete fusion of jazz and rock is cemented. It also garnered a place in the history books for guitarist John McLaughlin, the axis around whose raw, slash-and-burn playing, the entire album turns.</p><p>The five-CD Complete Jack Johnson Sessions set, covering February 18 to June 4 of 1970, reveals that a revolving cast of musicians entered the Davis/Macero music and sound lab and made a series of mind-bending, often inspired — yet sometimes maddeningly monotonous — recording dates, where the creation of backbeat-driven grooves and short, rhythmic, rock- and funk-inflected riffs were the only ideas presented by Davis; everything else flowed freely, for better or worse. No less than five albums have benefited from these sessions: the others include Live-Evil, Get Up With It, Directions, and Big Fun. The two cuts that make up A Tribute to Jack Johnson, ~Right Off~ and ~Yesternow,~ make up the last two selections on disc five. The arrangement of the session is basically chronological. Thus, there are not only numerous takes of a composition but insertion and remake takes as well. For instance, there are two takes of ~Willie Nelson,~ two inserted ~versions,~ and two remakes, all sequenced here in a row. Likewise is the strange genesis, deconstruction, and rebirth of ~Go Ahead John,~ which appeared in this form on Big Fun. Still, despite the hypnotic grooves where already elongated tunes turn into monolithic groove structures, the historical importance of these sessions, and the sheer listening pleasure they provide in doses, cannot be overestimated.</p><p>There are 17 previously unissued performances here, 14 takes, and alternates that have never been issued in full form! As a small example, the official unearthing of the ~Duran~ alternate take offers so much more in terms of different instrumentation (many alternates here provide this) and ambience than the circulated version that it is nearly a different tune altogether. The roots of ~Right Off~ and ~Yesternow,~ which appear on disc three, compare to the final heavily edited versions on the album as startlingly different compositions. Evolution becomes not only the crux of the Davis sessions, but a whole new way of making jazz records. These sides reveal how, decades later, Davis's own playing remains firmly committed to the jazz ideal as a soloist despite the fact that McLaughlin and others such as Bennie Maupin, Chick Corea, Wayne Shorter, Jack DeJohnette, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, Steve Grossman, Michael Henderson, Ron Carter, Sonny Sharrock, Airto, Dave Holland, and Hermeto Pascoal were essentially playing jam- and groove-based rock.</p><p>The role of guitarist Sonny Sharrock is finally defined here. It has previously been discounted and provided endless grist for the Davis rumor mill how he was mixed out of the session. Yes, he was, but so was almost everyone but McLaughlin and Miles at one point or another. Check out Sharrock's killer slide playing that appears on the second inset of ~Willie Nelson.~ For those who worship at the McLaughlin altar, there are the extra minutes of screaming, fuzz-drenched wailing on ~Right Off~ that were left on the floor by Macero. But this set is full of moments like that, such as the previously unreleased ~Sugar Ray,~ a futuristic look at electronic noise — with rhythm — as jazz.</p><p>It is true that attempting to listen to this as a box is an admittedly long, arduous, and sometimes difficult task. Taking on individual pieces, in a changer, or even a disc at a time, is a deeply engaging, provocative listening experience. If any recordings needed to be released in order to document the perfect fusion of jazz and rock — in addition to Miles' musical and studio development — it's these.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

				"review": "<p>Could there be any more confrontational sound in Miles Davis' vast catalog than the distorted guitars and tinny double-timing drums reacting to a two-note bass riff funking it up on the first track from On the Corner? Before the trumpet even enters the picture, the story has been broken off somewhere in the middle, with deep street music melding with a secret language held within the band and those who can actually hear this music — certainly not the majority of Miles' fan base built up over the past 25 years. They heard this as a huge ~f*ck you.~ Miles just shrugged and told them it wasn't personal, but they could take it that way if they wanted to, and he blew on his trumpet. Here are killer groove riffs that barely hold on as bleating trumpet and soprano sax lines (courtesy of Dave Liebman on track one) interact with John McLaughlin's distortion-box frenzy. Michael Henderson's bass keeps the basic so basic it hypnotizes; keyboards slowly enter the picture, a pair of them handled by Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea, as well as Ivory Williams' synthesizer. Finally, Colin Walcott jumps in with an electric sitar and there are no less than five drummers — three kits (Al Foster, Billy Hart, and Jack DeJohnette), a tabla player, and Mtume.</p><p>It's a four-tune suite, <i>~On the Corner~</i> is, but the separations hardly matter, just the shifts in groove that alter the time/space continuum. After 20 minutes, the set feels over and a form of Miles' strange lyricism returns in ~Black Satin.~ Though a tabla kicks the tune off, there's a recognizable eight-note melody that runs throughout. Carlos Garnett and Bennie Maupin replace Liebman, Dave Creamer replaces McLaughlin, and the groove rides a bit easier — except for those hand bells shimmering in the background off the beat just enough to make the squares crazy. The respite is short-lived, however. Davis and band move the music way over to the funk side of the street — though the street funkers thought these cats were too weird with their stranded time signatures and modal fugues that begin and end nowhere and live for the way the riff breaks down into emptiness. ~One and One~ begins the new tale, so jazz breaks down and gets polished off and resurrected as a far blacker, deeper-than-blue character in the form of ~Helen Butte/Mr. Freedom X,~ where guitars and horns careen off Henderson's cracking bass and Foster's skittering hi-hats. It may sound weird even today, but <i>On the Corner</i> is the most street record ever recorded by a jazz musician. And it still kicks.</p><p> &mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b></p>"

				"review": "<p>Big Fun was roundly slagged off when it was issued in 1974 as holdover material from Bitches Brew. In fact, a lot of the double albums Miles was pumping out at the time were considered holdover material. In the case of this double reissue, that claim is partially true. The original Big Fun featured four side-long tracks: ~Great Expectations,~ ~Ife,~ ~Go Ahead John,~ and ~Lonely Fire,~ all of them recorded with different ensembles, three with 11-piece bands (which included Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Billy Cobham, Bennie Maupin, Larry Young, Ron Carter, Steve Grossman, Airto, Jack DeJohnette, and many others) and one — ~Go Ahead John~ — with a quintet. All of the material was recorded between 1969 and 1972. The four other tracks here, to round out this double-CD package, all appear on the four-CD Bitches Brew Sessions box set. They are ~Recollections,~ ~Trevere,~ ~The Little Blue Frog,~ and ~Yaphet.~ Some of these were recorded at the same time the original tracks had been and the ensembles match up, as on ~Great Expectations~ and ~Yaphet,~ and the pairing of ~The Little Blue Frog,~ ~Lonely Fire,~ and ~Trevere.~ What's wild is, even in the same sessions, there are differences in personnel. What all of this points to, other than the savvy of the reissue producers, is simple: Miles was restless his entire career, but never like he was when he discovered electricity. There is plenty of argument to suggest he never found what he was looking for but came very close numerous times. Here, as Miles breaks down the pedal points of his modal language to include Indian ragas — and the musicians who play them — as he does on Joe Zawinul's ~Great Expectations~ and his own ~Yaphet,~ ~Trevere,~ and ~Lonely Fire,~ Davis opens the door to allowing his musicians to play outside of any jazz convention and still stay plugged in as a band. Listen to John McLaughlin's playing here, with its chunky restraint and aplomb and then — as on the ~Go Ahead John~ quintet session — fire. There has never been another Miles solo like the one here either; multi-tracked and many-faceted, it is as if he carries within it the history of music in the world. Or pick up the slippery intertwining of Dave Holland's acoustic and Harvey Brooks' electric basses, creating whole-tone drones along with the sitars while pumping rhythmic invention toward the band. Ultimately, amid the drones and the funk, there is the particular brand of lyricism that belonged only to Miles Davis. Listening to either the four original tracks or the two CDs taken as a session edited for one album, it hardly matters — the deep hues and pleasant pastoral wonders that Big Fun provides are as moving, mysterious, and beautiful as anything Miles ever created.</p><p><b>&mdash; Thom Jurek</b></p>"

Using funky but unpredictable rhythm sections and leaving space for plenty of solos, Davis created a unique brand of fusion that has yet to be satisfactorily duplicated. Among his more notable sidemen during this era are altoist Kenny Garrett, Foley on lead bass (which he used as a lower-toned guitar), one or two keyboardists chosen from Joey DeFrancesco, Adam Holzman, Robert Irving III, Kei Akagi, and John Beasley, various bassists, drummers, and percussionists, and on ~Amandla,~ the tenor of Rick Margitza. Davis is in consistently strong form throughout the numbers, which include ~In a Silent Way,~ ~New Blues,~ ~Human Nature,~ ~Tutu,~ and ~Time After Time.~ Quite often the live versions of these songs are more creative and exciting than the ones previously issued. This highly recommended CD (released in 1996) concludes with one number (~Hannibal~) from Davis' final performance; it is not given a date but is most likely from just a few weeks before his death at age 65. No Miles Davis collection is complete without this important set.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Scott Yanow</strong></p>"

Here, several dance producers are brought into the fold, not just to rearrange the material but to remix it as well. The versions that work the best are done by producers unafraid to tamper with the tapes: hence, two separate reworkings of ~Rated X~ (from Get Up with It) result in darkside drum'n'bass burners by Doc Scott and Jamie Myerson that find the hyperkinetic energy in the original. The highlight of the entire project is an inexplicably vinyl-only bonus track by DJ Krush, who turns ~Black Satin/On the Corner~ into a minimalist beat odyssey with several different passages and effective scratching in all the right places. The only real disappointment on Panthalassa: The Remixes finds trip-hop deconstructionist DJ Cam creating an uneasy alliance by crudely inserting a loping breakbeat onto Miles' winsome solo from ~In a Silent Way.~ Remix albums are often a mistake for both parties involved, but this one does work on several levels.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>John Bush</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>This two-hour documentary was produced by Mike Dibb for the BBC's Channel Four network and as of this writing -- in 2008 -- The Miles Davis Story (2002) stands as the most honest biopic assessment of his life and career that has ever been assembled. Even as the primary focus remains on the music, none of Davis' skeletons are off limits, with plenty of first-hand accounts of him at his best and worst. Few stones are left unturned, from his unsettling relationships to the chronic bouts of substance abuse that fuelled his more disturbing personal incidents. Dibb's narration is sparse as the saga unfolds in the interviews. While all of the performance footage has circulated for decades among Davis devotees, it is actually the engaging and revealing comments -- courtesy of those he shared his life with on and off the bandstand -- that provide insights into the man behind the horn.</p><p>Among the key contributors are Clark Terry -- Davis' mentor from his early days in East St. Louis, IL -- as well as Jimmy Cobb, who was the last surviving member of the Kind of Blue (1959) musical dream team. Herbie Hancock (keyboards), Ron Carter (bass), Dave Holland (bass), Jack DeJohnette (drums), Joe Zawinul (keyboards), Keith Jarrett (keyboards), Chick Corea (keyboards), Mahavishnu John McLaughlin (guitar), David Liebman (sax), and Marcus Miller (bass) also provide their respective perspectives. As do two of the most important men behind the scenes: Bob Weinstock, the owner of the Riverside Jazz label, and Columbia Records' George Avakian. Both gentlemen deserve a tremendous amount of credit in their foresight when signing Davis, whose reputation as an irascible force of nature made him undesirable yet magnetic. As mentioned above there are plenty of concert excerpts of the artist. Yet one major oversight is the lack of any full-length performances. Arguably, these might not be appropriate in the context of the main program. However, the lack of substantive extras on this title make the additions a no-brainer. That said, viewers can find a cursory text biography and an equally perfunctory illustrated discography that deals exclusively with Davis' Columbia Records library.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

Though he's primarily self-taught   as a guitarist, his grandfather played violin with The San Francisco Symphony   and his father was a classical pianist. Even more significant are de Grassi's   ties to one of contemporary instrumental music's most influential labels: Windham   Hill. In addition to his status as one of the company's finest and most consistently   intriguing artists, de Grassi is literally a member of the Windham Hill clan. </p><p>After earning a degree in urban geography from U. C. Berkeley and performing   as a street musician in London, he made ends meet by learning the carpentry   trade from his cousin <a href=~/cg/x.dll?p=amg&sql=B50344~>Will Ackerman</a>,   who was just starting a small instrumental record label. De Grassi was encouraged   to record his first album, <i>Turning: Turning Back</i>, for the fledgling Windham   Hill company. As it turns out, he had more going for him than good connections. </p><p>Over the years, de Grassi has proven to be an innovative guitarist and composer   whose mastery of acoustic finger-picking styles has grown to include a variety   of other techniques and ethnic influences. Though he left briefly to record   with RCA Novus, de Grassi has since returned to the Windham Hill fold. In the   mid '80s, his travels to Bolivia became a major inspiration. He made numerous   field recordings during his visits and first incorporated indigenous influences   from the culture on his 1987 RCA Novus release <i>Altiplano</i>. His contacts   with Bolivia's Contemporary Orchestra of Native Instruments also set in motion   the ensemble's first American release <i>Arawl</i> on the New Albion label. </p><p><b> Linda Kohanov, All Music Guide</b></p>",

The rest of the lineup was Bobby Whitlock (b. 1948, Memphis, TN) (keyboards, vocals), Carl Radle (b. 1942, Oklahoma City, OK -- d. May 30, 1980) (bass), and Jim Gordon (b. 1945, Los Angeles) (drums). The group debuted at the Lyceum Ballroom in London on June 14 and undertook a summer tour of England. From late August to early October, they recorded the celebrated double album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (November 1970) with guitarist Duane Allman sitting in. They then returned to touring in England and the U.S., playing their final date on December 6.</p><p>The Layla album was successful in the U.S., where ~Bell Bottom Blues~ and the title song charted as singles in abbreviated versions, but it did not chart in the U.K. The Dominos reconvened to record a second album in May 1971, but split up without completing it.

Re-released as a single at its full, seven-minute length in connection with the compilation album History of Eric Clapton (Atco 803) (March 1972), ~Layla~ hit the Top Ten in the U.S. and the U.K. in the summer of 1972. (It would return to the U.K. Top Ten in 1982.) A live album, Derek and the Dominos in Concert (January 1973), taken from the 1970 U.S. tour, was also a strong seller.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/dd-crossroads.jpg~ alt=~Crossroads~><p>Time has only added to the renown of the group, which is now rated among Eric Clapton's most outstanding achievements.

The Layla Sessions was a 1990 box set expanding that album across three CDs/cassettes.

It was also, other than Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert -- which actually took place in the same month that this set was issued, and was issued eight months later -- the only new Clapton material that anyone would see for over a year, as the guitarist struggled through personal turmoil that included heroin addiction. No one who wasn't personally close to him knew that at the time -- this and the Rainbow Concert album were issued to keep his name before the public. And at the time, a lot of fans and critics were disappointed by this set -- the Layla album had already started to take on iconic status, with lots of listeners wearing out that album's grooves and reveling in its complexity, intensity, and seeming studio-generated perfection (plus the presence of Duane Allman).</p><p>Comprised of live performances, In Concert never seemed as compelling: for starters, Allman hadn't been present for either of the shows that was recorded (and, in fact, only appeared at a tiny handful of Dominos performances), which made this a somewhat different band. And what we did get was a much more relaxed and often more soulful, involving body of music, starting with the opening track, ~Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad~ and continuing with ~Got to Get Better in a Little While~; there was also some disappointment in the sound quality, however, and with the song selection. Despite the fact that they were touring to support the album that carried its name, the group seldom ever performed their most recognizable song, ~Layla~; and their repertory was filled out with material from past Clapton projects rather than more material off the Layla album; in effect, the Dominos had become the first Eric Clapton Band, which made this a little less than a live account of this band's work. Thus, it was the hardcore fans who fully embraced this record, mostly for its transcendent moments and the beautiful interplay of the musicians, especially on their own repertory.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

Live at the Fillmore is not exactly an expanded version of In Concert; it is a different album culled from the same concerts that were used to compile the earlier album. Live at the Fillmore contains six of the nine recordings originally released on In Concert, and three of its five previously unreleased performances are different recordings of songs also featured on In Concert -- ~Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?,~ ~Tell the Truth,~ and ~Let It Rain.~ The other two, ~Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out~ and ~Little Wing,~ have not been heard before in any concert version. Even when the same recordings are used on Live at the Fillmore as on In Concert, they have, as noted, been remixed and, as not noted, re-edited. In either form, Derek and the Dominos' October 1970 stand at the Fillmore East, a part of the group's only U.S. tour, finds them a looser aggregation than they seemed to be in the studio making their only album, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. A trio backing Eric Clapton, the Dominos leave the guitarist considerable room to solo on extended numbers, five of which run over ten minutes each. Clapton doesn't show consistent invention, but his playing is always directed, and he plays more blues than you can hear on any other Clapton live recording.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>This is, perhaps, the one. Derek Trucks has been on an aesthetic quest for something since he began his own recording career in 1997 — apart from his membership in the Allman Brothers Band. Each record has gone further into establishing Trucks not only as a slide guitar wizard (that happened when he was still in his teens), but also as a serious songwriter, fine arranger, and bandleader. The Derek Trucks Band, as evidenced by the release of 2003's Soul Serenade, is a unit — a band — whose core has been together for eight years. They create an atmosphere, a sound, a musical sense of place and community. On Live at the Georgia Theater (available only on the Internet), the DTB performed with new vocalist Mike Mattison, who gave them something they needed: a strong, utilitarian presence that could be as diverse and adventurous as the band was musically. This album's title, Songlines, was inspired by the late author Bruce Chatwin's description of aboriginal creation myths. According to these myths, the world was sung into existence by totemic elder beings who wandered the Australian continent along invisible pathways. These were later known as ~songlines~ because by singing out the names of everything — trees, flowers, streams, animals, clouds, earth — they breathed form, order, and beauty into a world that was being born. The DTB try to express something similar on their first real studio recording with assistance by producer Jay Joyce. This album was not recorded trying to capture a live performance in the confines of a studio. There are no tracks here that give way to loose jamming; these are songs. In fact, it was carefully crafted and executed. But the rawness, the energy, and the unpredictable musicality are everywhere present.</p><p>They are there in the brief read of Rahsaan Roland Kirk's ~Volunteered Slavery~ and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's ~Sahib Teri Bandi/Maki Madni,~ both of which are live staples, and the slippery read of Toots Hibbert's ~Sailing On~ — but also in the raw, rangy American street blues of ~Chevrolet,~ by Lonnie and Ed Young, and the low-down seductive vintage funky R&B in ~All I Do.~ Kofi Burbridge's Hammond B-3 and keyboard work create a center for Trucks and the formidable rhythm section of drummer Yonrico Scott, percussionist Count Mbutu, and Todd Smallie on in-the-pocket bass. The originals on the set are leaner, meaner, and more down in the groove — check out the group vocal chants on the refrain of ~Revolution,~ as Trucks slips and slides over them. The skittering funky organ lines and Trucks' twinned slide riff and edgy fills give ~All I Do~ its slippery backbone-dropping groove. ~Majoun~ (a Moroccan word for pot) is the kind of drifting, Eastern-tinged jazz that the band is known for playing live. And the fascination with the East doesn't end there. In the soul and gospel-drenched declamatory prayer ~I Wish I Knew (How It Would Feel to Be Free),~ there is some fine Dobro work by Trucks and Burbridge's upright piano strides it out, before Trucks brings out the electric again and lets it slowly tear through the verse and chorus accompanied by handclaps. It's deeply moving. The set closes with ~This Sky,~ a gently evolving open modal tune. Trucks' guitar is tuned to whole tones and he explores the mode thoroughly yet softly, mannered until he finds its bottom where bass, drums, the B-3, and percussion slip in to carry the tune. And as Mattison enters with the lyric (some of it by the Sufi poet Hafiz), the listener is already hooked in the image of the story, of suffering lovers who should be dancing in the ecstasy and beauty of the sky where they live. Songlines is the finest moment in the Derek Trucks Band's recording career. It's a fully mature, deeply reckoned studio album that bears repeated listening to reveal all its subtlety and the beauty of its creation.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b></p>"

		"biography": "<p>A folkie in punk's clothing, Ani DiFranco battled successfully against the Goliath of corporate rock to emerge as one of the most influential and inspirational cult heroines of the 1990s. A resolute follower of D.I.Y. ethos, DiFranco released her records through her own indie label Righteous Babe, slowly but steadily building a devout grass-roots following on the strength of a relentless tour schedule; an ardent feminist and an open bisexual, her songs tackled issues like rape, abortion and sexism with insight and compassion, the music's empowering attitude and anger tempered by the poignant candor of singer-songwriter confessionalism.</p><p>Born in Buffalo, New York on September 23, 1970, DiFranco began her career at the age of nine, when her guitar teacher helped her land her first gig -- performing a set of Beatles covers -- at an area coffeehouse. Befriended by the likes of Suzanne Vega and Michelle Shocked, she later gave up music to study ballet, but at the age of 14 returned to the guitar and began composing her first songs. A year later, alienated from her crumbling family structure, she left home, living with friends while making the rounds of the Buffalo folk club circuit.</p><p>By the age of 19 DiFranco had written over 100 original songs, and after briefly studying art she relocated to New York City to further her musical aspirations; besieged by requests from fans for tapes of her performances, she recorded a demo and pressed 500 copies of a self-titled cassette to sell at shows. The tape -- a spartan acoustic folk collection of intensely personal essays on failed relationships and gender inequities -- quickly sold out, and in 1990 DiFranco founded Righteous Babe to better distribute her recordings, which were slowly spreading across the country on the strength of a substantial word-of-mouth following.</p><p>In 1991, after issuing the assured <i>Not So Soft</i>, DiFranco hit the road alone, touring the nation in her Volkswagen and playing gigs wherever she could find them; her cult blossomed, and her distinct image -- shaved head, tattoos and body piercings -- soon became the de rigueur look for her fans as well. As albums like 1992's <i>Imperfectly</i> and 1993's <i>Puddle Dive</i> expanded her musical ambitions as well as her following, DiFranco became the subject of considerable major-label interest, yet she steadfastly rejected all offers as Righteous Babe grew to become a highly viable business venture.</p><p>DiFranco continued playing over 200 dates a year, and soon even the mainstream media took notice of her cottage-industry music; after 1994's masterful <i>Out of Range</i>, she exploded with the following year's <i>Not a Pretty Girl</i>, which garnered notice from outlets ranging from CNN to the New York Times. 1996's <i>Dilate</i>, a sprawling, eclectic work detailing a heated love affair with a man -- much to the chagrin of her lesbian followers -- even debuted in the Top 100 of the Billboard charts, a stunning achievement for an independent release. The live set <i>Living in Clip</i> followed in 1997.</p>Early in 1998, DiFranco released the studio effort <i>Little Plastic Castle</i>; her most musically diverse release yet, it also was her highest-charting album to date, and set the stage for the release of <i>Up Up Up Up Up Up</i> the following year. Another new LP, <i>To the Teeth</i>, appeared in 1999 as well and in mid-2000 came the release of the odds-and-ends compilation <i>Swing Set</i>. <i>Revelling: Reckoning</i> appeared in spring 2001. In 2002, DiFranco trudged on; a road warrior at heart, she issued her first live album since 1997's <i>Living In Clip</i>, <i>So Much Shouting, So Much Laughter</i> in September 2002. This particular double-disc set captured handpicked favorites by DiFranco and three songs previously unreleased. The following year's <i>Evolve</i> added funk, jazz and Latin elements to the mix, while 2004's <i>Educated Guess</i> was performed completely by DiFranco. <i>Knuckle Down</i>, co-produced by Joe Henry, arrived in 2005.</p>&mdash; <b>Jason Ankeny</b>",

Dilate suffers from a bit too much repetition, but when DiFranco lands on a good hook -- such as ~Superhero~ or ~Done Wrong~ -- the results suggest that she could reach a wider audience.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Owens</b>"

Born on July 22, 1954 in Jersey City, New Jersey, Di Meola briefly studied at the Berklee College of Music in Boston during the early '70s before accepting a job replacing guitarist Bill Connors in fusion trailblazers Return to Forever (a group that also included monster instrumentalists keyboardist Chick Corea, bassist Stanley Clarke, and drummer Lenny White) in 1974. It was with Di Meola that Return to Forever enjoyed their greatest commercial success, as such releases as 1974's Where Have I Known Before, 1975's No Mystery, and 1976's Romantic Warrior cracked the U.S. Top 40 before Di Meola jumped ship to launch a solo career.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/al-dimi-midnight-sun.jpg~ alt=~Land of the Midnight Sun~><p>What followed remains some of the finest jazz fusion guitar-based recordings ever: 1976's Land of the Midnight Sun, 1977's Elegant Gypsy (which would eventually earn gold certification in the U.S.), and Casino, plus 1979's Splendido Hotel. Di Meola then united with fellow guitar greats John McLaughlin and Paco de Lucía for 1980's Friday Night in San Francisco. Throughout the '80s and '90s, he racked up numerous accolades (including earning yearly top honors in Guitar Player magazine polls), kept on issuing solo releases on a regular basis, and played with others, including releases by Stomu Yamashta, Paul Simon, Stanley Jordan, and David Matthews, as well as further work with such former bandmates as Corea, Clarke, de Lucía, and McLaughlin.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/al-dimi-world-sinfonia.jpg~ alt=~World Sinfonia~><p>During the '90s, Di Meola turned his back almost entirely on fusion to concentrate more on acoustic-based world music, as evidenced by such releases as World Sinfonia, Di Meola Plays Piazzolla, and Heart of the Immigrants, among others. During the 2000s, Di Meola continued this eclectic approach with releases like 2003's Revisited, 2006's Consequence of Chaos, 2007's Diabolic Inventions and Seduction for Solo Guitar, Vol. 1: Music of Astor Piazzolla, and 2008's live album He and Carmen with flutist Eszter Horgas. In 2011, Di Meola delivered the Latin and world music-infused studio album Pursuit of Radical Rhapsody, featuring bassist Charlie Haden and Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/al-dimi-elysium.jpg~ alt=~Elysium~><p>The lushly textured fusion effort Elysium followed in 2015. Two years later, Di Meola delivered the concert album Morocco Fantasia, recorded live at the Mawazine Festival in Rabat, Morocco. Along with Di Meola's band, the show featured guest appearances by Moroccan musicians oud player Said Chraibi, violinist Abdellah Meri, and percussionist Tarik Ben Ali. In 2018, he delivered Opus, which featured contributions from Cuban-born pianist Kemuel Roig.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Greg Prato</strong></p>",

He was still a member of Return to Forever at the time and was a stronger guitarist than composer, but di Meola did put a lot of thought into this music. The brief ~Lady of Rome, Sister of Brazil~ (an acoustic guitar solo) and ~Mediterranean Sundance~ (an acoustic duet with fellow guitarist Paco de Lucía) hints at di Meola's future directions.

A welcome addition to his already impressive catalogue, DiMeola Plays Piazzola pays homage to the late Argentinean tango master Astor Piazzolla (whose distinctive and very poetic brand of romanticism was considered quite daring and radical in Argentina). It would have been easy for an artist to allow his own personality to become obscured when saluting Piazzola's legacy, but the charismatic DiMeola is too great an improvisor to let that happen. Though his reverence for Piazzola comes through loud and clear on these haunting classics, there's no mistaking the fact that this is very much an Al DiMeola project.</p>&mdash; <b>Alex Henderson</b>"

Offering classic guitar lines on an array of guitars (including a vintage Les Paul, Fender Stratocaster, and Conde-Romano acoustic), Al DiMeola is memorable, timeless, and true to the beauty, culture and sensual imagery that inspired him to compose and arrange these eight great songs. Each song is a masterpiece, and such compositions as ~Flesh on Flesh~ (which features him on five different instruments), ~Zona Desperata,~ and ~Fugata~ (which showcases DiMeola trading with Gonzalo Rubalcaba on their Fender Rhodes solo in part three) are just three of the musical statements befitting all who've been lucky enough to see or hear DiMeola's phenomenal sound ~live.~ To hear that same energy and excitement recorded ~live~ on Flesh on Flesh is especially gratifying since the music is developed and takes place in a new context, space, and time. You'll find that every graceful musical curve, every dynamic concept, every technological update heard on Flesh on Flesh is a celebration of new forms and functions, of strict rhythmic reinterpretation and the inimitable DiMeola sound and guitar virtuosity.

				"review": "<p>The sticker on the disc's cover states that this is ~a return to his solid-body electric guitar,~ and while that may be true in parts, Consequence of Chaos is still pretty far from the tense, nonstop electric sizzle of di Meola's first three albums, which are landmarks in the jazz fusion genre. And while there is plenty of electric guitar here — and a musical reconnection with Chick Corea, Steve Gadd, and Barry Miles, all of whom have previously worked with di Meola — this is still dominated by the world music and more subtle framework that have characterized the guitarist's playing for the last few decades. The performances are uniformly excellent, and even though the approach shifts from prog to acoustic to electric and world, di Meola's distinctive style and classy approach congeal the music with authority. ~Tao~ alone takes more turns than a craggy mountain road, but never gets predictable or pretentious. Di Meola knows when to hold back and when to unleash his precise, percussive, fret-shredding Latin lines, and it's that sense of restraint that makes this disc, and much of his recent work, so successful. These instrumental pieces lay down a groove upon which di Meola solos with different combinations of musicians. Melodies are difficult to pinpoint, but the sublime playing keeps the listener's interest despite a tendency to wander. Four brief, low-key interludes feature an unaccompanied di Meola playing all the instruments, and provide a more relaxed counterpoint to the busier band tracks. Percussionists Ernie Adams and Gumbi Ortiz's standout work, especially on the subtle ~Hypnose,~ add hot, bubbling flavor to the project. Chick Corea only appears on two tracks, but both are highlights. The lovely acoustic duet on ~Cry for You~ brings out the best in both musicians as their interplay reaches new heights. Di Meola calls the nine-minute ~Tempest~ his most complex piece — which is saying a lot — as it twists through different moods and tones utilizing varying rhythms in an impressive display of the guitarist's dazzling skills. It's a summation of this album that shows di Meola, after 30 years as a solo artist, to be on the top of his game.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Hal Horowitz</b></p>"

If anything, the band was a direct outgrowth of the roots-revivalism of pub rock, but where pub rock celebrated good times, Dire Straits were melancholy. Led by guitarist/vocalist Mark Knopfler, the group built their sound upon the laid-back blues-rock of J.J. Cale, but they also had jazz and country inflections, occasionally dipping into the epic song structures of progressive rock. The band's music was offset by Knopfler's lyrics, which approximated the winding, stream-of-conscious narratives of Bob Dylan. As their career progressed, Dire Straits became more refined and their new maturity happened to coincide with the rise of MTV and the compact disc. These two musical revolutions from the mid-'80s helped make Dire Straits' sixth album, Brothers in Arms, an international blockbuster. The band — along with Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, and Steve Winwood — become one of the leaders of a group of self-consciously mature veteran rock & rollers in the late '80s that designed their music to appeal to aging baby boomers. Despite the band's international success, they couldn't sustain their stardom, waiting a full six years to deliver a followup to Brothers in Arms, by which time their audience had shrunk significantly.</p><p>Mark Knopfler (b. August 12, 1949) was always the main force behind Dire Straits. The son of an architect, Knopfler studied English literature at Leeds University, and worked briefly as a rock critic for the Yorkshire Evening Post while at college. He began teaching English after his graduation, leading a pub-rock band called Brewer's Droop at night. By 1977, Mark was playing with his brother David (guitar) and his roommate, John Illsley (bass). During the summer of 1977, the trio cut a demo with drummer Pick Withers. A London DJ named Charlie Gillett heard the demo and began playing ~Sultans of Swing~ on his BBC show, Honky Tonkin'. Following a tour opening for Talking Heads, the band began recording their debut for Vertigo Records with producer Muff Winwood in early 1978. By the summer, they had signed with Warner in America, releasing their eponymous debut in the fall. Thanks to the Top 10 hit ~Sultans of Swing,~ Dire Straits was a major success in both Britain and America, with the single and album climbing into the Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>Dire Straits established Dire Straits as a major force on album-oriented radio in America, and their second album, Communique (1979), consolidated their audience, selling three million copies worldwide. As the group was recording its third album, Dave Knopfler left the band to pursue a solo career; he was replaced by former Darling member Hal Lindes. Like its predecessor, Making Movies was a sizable hit in America and Britain, even though the band was criticized for musically treading water. Nevertheless, the record went gold on the strength of the radio and MTV hits ~Romeo and Juliet~ and ~Skateaway.~ Dire Straits followed the album two years later with Love Over Gold, an album filled with long, experimental passages, plus the single ~Private Investigations~ which became a number two hit in the UK. The album went gold in America and spent four weeks at number one in Britain. Shortly after the release of Love Over Gold, former Rockpile drummer Terry Williams replaced Withers.</p><p>During 1982, Mark Knopfler began exploring musical avenues outside of Dire Straits, scoring the Bill Forsyth film Local Hero and playing on Van Morrison's Beautiful Vision. Apart from releasing the Twisting By the Pool EP early in 1983, Dire Straits was quiet for the majority of 1983 and 1984, as Knopfler produced Bob Dylan's Infidels, as well as Aztec Camera and Willy De Ville; he also wrote ~Private Dancer~ for Tina Turner's comeback album. In the spring of 1984, the band released the double-album Dire Straits Live — Alchemy and by the end of the year, they had begun recording their fifth studio album with their new keyboardist, Guy Fletcher. Released in the summer of 1985, Brothers in Arms was Dire Straits' breakthrough album, making the band international stars. Supported by the ground-breaking computer-animated video for ~Money for Nothing,~ a song which mocked music videos, the album became a blockbuster, spending nine weeks at the top of the American charts and selling over nine million copies; in England, the album became the biggest-selling album of the '80s. ~Walk of Life~ and ~So Far Away~ kept Brothers in Arms in the charts through 1986, and Dire Straits played over 200 dates in support of the album. Once the tour was completed, Dire Straits went on hiatus for several years, as Knopfler produced records by Randy Newman and Joan Armatrading, scored films, toured with Eric Clapton, and recorded a duet album with Chet Atkins (Neck and Neck, 1990). In 1989, he formed the country-rock group Notting Hillbillies, whose sole album Missing ... Presumed Having A Good Time became a British hit upon its spring 1990 release. During the extended time off, John Illsley recorded his second album; the first appeared in 1984.</p><p>In 1990, Knopfler reconvened Dire Straits, which now featured Illsley, Clark and Fletcher, and various session musicians. The band released On Every Street in the fall of 1991 to great anticipation. However, the album failed to meet expectations — it only went platinum in America and it didn't crack the UK Top 40 — and failed to generate a hit single. Similarly, the tour was a disappointment, with many tickets going unsold in both the US and Europe. Once the tour was completed, the live album On the Night was released in the spring of 1993 and the band again went on hiatus. In 1996, Mark Knopfler launched his solo career with Golden Heart.</p>&mdash; Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

Driven by Mark Knopfler's spare, tasteful guitar lines and his husky warbling, the album is a set of bluesy rockers. And while the bar band mentality of pub-rock is at the core of Dire Straits — even the group's breakthrough single, ~Sultans of Swing,~ offered a lament for a neglected pub rock band — their music is already beyond the simple boogies and shuffles of their forefathers, occasionally dipping into jazz and country. Knopfler also shows an inclination toward Dylanesque imagery, which enhances the smoky, low-key atmosphere of the album. While a few of the songs fall flat, the album is remarkably accomplished for a debut, and Dire Straits had difficulty surpassing it throughout their career.</p>&mdash; Stephen Thomas Erlewine"

But there was no track as focused as ~Sultans of Swing,~ even if ~Lady Writer~ (a lesser singles chart entry on both sides of the Atlantic) nearly duplicated its sound. As a result, Communiqué sold immediately to Dire Straits' established audience, but no more, and it did not fare as well critically as its predecessor or its follow-up.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Naturally, this means that Mark Knopfler's ambitions as a songwriter are growing, as the storytelling pretensions of Making Movies indicate. Fortunately, his skills are increasing, as the lovely ~Romeo and Juliet,~ ~Tunnel of Love,~ and ~Skateaway~ indicate. And Making Movies is helped by a new wave-tinged pop production, which actually helps Knopfler's jazzy inclinations take hold. The record runs out of steam toward the end, closing with the borderline offensive ~Les Boys,~ but the remainder of Making Movies ranks among the band's finest work.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"biography": "<P>The Doors, one of the most influential and controversial rock bands of the 1960s, were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by UCLA film students Ray Manzarek, keyboards, and Jim Morrison, vocals; with drummer John Densmore and guitarist Robby Krieger. The group never added a bass player, and their sound was dominated by Manzarek's electric organ work and Morrison's deep, sonorous voice, with which he sang and intoned his highly poetic lyrics. The group signed to Elektra Records in 1966 and released its first album, The Doors, featuring the hit ~Light My Fire,~ in 1967.</P><P>Like ~Light My Fire,~ the debut album was a massive hit, and endures as one of the most exciting, groundbreaking recordings of the psychedelic era. Blending blues, classical, Eastern music, and pop into sinister but beguiling melodies, the band sounded like no other. With his rich, chilling vocals and somber poetic visions, Morrison explored the depths of the darkest and most thrilling aspects of the psychedelic experience. Their first effort was so stellar, in fact, that the Doors were hard-pressed to match it, and although their next few albums contained a wealth of first-rate material, the group also began running up against the limitations of their recklessly disturbing visions. By their third album, they had exhausted their initial reservoir of compositions, and some of the tracks they hurriedly devised to meet public demand were clearly inferior to, and imitative of, their best early work.</P><P>On The Soft Parade, the group experimented with brass sections, with mixed results. Accused (without much merit) by much of the rock underground as pop sellouts, the group charged back hard with the final two albums they recorded with Morrison, on which they drew upon stone-cold blues for much of their inspiration, especially on 1971's L.A. Woman.</P><P>From the start, the Doors' focus was the charismatic Morrison, who proved increasingly unstable over the group's brief career. In 1969, Morrison was arrested for indecent exposure during a concert in Miami, an incident that nearly derailed the band. Nevertheless, the Doors managed to turn out a series of successful albums and singles through 1971, when, upon the completion of L.A. Woman, Morrison decamped for Paris. He died there, apparently of a drug overdose. The three surviving Doors tried to carry on without him, but ultimately disbanded. Yet the Doors' music and Morrison's legend continued to fascinate succeeding generations of rock fans: In the mid-'80s, Morrison was as big a star as he'd been in the mid-'60s, and Elektra has sold numerous quantities of the Doors' original albums plus reissues and releases of live material over the years, while publishers have flooded bookstores with Doors and Morrison biographies. In 1991, director Oliver Stone made The Doors, a feature film about the group starring Val Kilmer as Morrison.</P>— <B>William Ruhlmann &amp; Richie Unterberger</B> ",

Besides fine production from Joe Boyd and assistance from folks like Fairport Convention's Richard Thompson and his unrelated bass counterpart from Pentangle, Danny Thompson, Drake also recruited school friend Robert Kirby to create most of the just-right string and wind arrangements. His own performance itself steered a careful balance between too-easy accessibility and maudlin self-reflection, combining the best of both worlds while avoiding the pitfalls on either side. The result was a fantastic debut appearance, and if the cult of Drake consistently reads more into his work than is perhaps deserved, Five Leaves Left is still a most successful effort. Having grown out of the amiable but derivative styles captured on the long-circulating series of bootleg home recordings, Drake assays his tunes with just enough drama -- world-weariness in the vocals, carefully paced playing, and more -- to make it all work. His lyrics capture a subtle poetry of emotion, as on the pastoral semi-fantasia of ~The Thoughts of Mary Jane,~ which his soft, articulate singing brings even more to the full. Sometimes he projects a little more clearly, as on the astonishing voice-and-strings combination ~Way to Blue,~ while elsewhere he's not so clear, suggesting rather than outlining the mood. Understatement is the key to his songs and performances' general success, which makes the combination of his vocals and Rocky Dzidzornu's congas on ~Three Hours~ and the lovely ~'Cello Song,~ to name two instances, so effective. Danny Thompson is the most regular side performer on the album, his bass work providing subtle heft while never standing in the way of the song -- kudos well deserved for Boyd's production as well.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Ned Raggett</strong></p>"

		"biography": "<p>The technically proficient guitar playing of John Petrucci elevated Dream Theater to the upper echelons of contemporary heavy metal. While its lineup has continuously evolved, the Long Island-based quintet has consistently delivered sharp-edged music. Dream Theater is known for its high-energy concert performances. While they've released several live albums -- Live at the Marquee, recorded at the London club; Live in Japan, recorded during the Music in Progress tour in 1993; and a triple CD and DVD, Live Scenes from New York -- they remain one of heavy metal's most bootlegged bands.</p><p>Originally named Majesty by Berklee College of Music students Petrucci, bassist John Myung, and drummer Mike Portnoy, the band soon expanded with the addition of keyboard player Kevin Moore and vocalist Chris Collins. Releasing an eight-tune demo, Majesty Demo, as Majesty, the group sold 1,000 copies within six months. The departure of Collins in late 1986 left Majesty without a vocalist, and after a long period of auditioning possible replacements, the group settled on Charlie Dominici in November 1987. Changing its name, the group agreed on ~Dream Theater,~ inspired by a now-demolished California movie theater. Signing with Mechanic Records, the group began working on its first full-length album. Delays caused by label mismanagement limited the group to performing at small clubs and bars. Frustrated by its experiences with the label, Dream Theater finally severed its ties with Mechanic.</p><p>This was only one drastic change in the band's course of action. Firing Dominici, the group spent the next couple years searching for a vocalist. The search ended in late 1991 when a demo tape from Canadian vocalist James LaBrie, formerly of Winter Rose, arrived. After flying to New York to audition, LaBrie was invited to join the band. Signing with Atco Atlantic (which came to be known as East West), Dream Theater released its second album, Images & Words, in 1992. One of three videos based on songs from the album, ~Pull Me Under,~ became an MTV hit. Although Theater showed considerable growth with their third studio album, Awake, recorded between May and July 1994, the group continued to be hampered by personnel changes. Before the album was mixed, keyboardist Moore left the group to focus on his solo career. Hired as a temporary replacement for the band's Waking Up the World tour, Derek Sherinian later became a permanent member. His first recording with Dream Theater was a 23-minute epic, ~A Change of Seasons,~ written in 1989 and released in September 1995 on the album of the same name.</p><p>Following a mini tour, Fix for '96, the members of Dream Theater separated for several months and became involved with a variety of outside projects. Petrucci was the busiest. In addition to joining Portnoy and keyboard player Jordan Rudess in the Liquid Tension Experiment -- a group that included influential bassist/stick player Tony Levin -- Petrucci played guitar with Trent Gardner's Explorers Club and made a guest appearance on Shadow Gallery's Tyranny album. Myung and Sherinian collaborated with King's X vocalist Ty Tabor in the band Platypus. LaBrie worked with Mull Muzzler, a group formed with Matt Guillory and Mike Mangini.</p><p>Dream Theater experienced yet another change when Rudess was tapped to replace Sherinian, who had been fired in 1999. The band released the progressive rock-heavy Scenes from a Memory that year, a conceptual piece that followed the story of a 1928 murder of a young woman and how a modern man is haunted by the crime. It was followed by Live Scenes from New York in 2001, which suffered from an unintentional bout with controversy when its original cover featuring the city of New York in flames was pulled due to the events of September 11. The group continued in the progressive metal vein in 2002 with Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, followed by the leaner Train of Thought in 2003 and Octavarium in 2005. The live album Score: XOX was released in 2006 and featured the band backed by a 29-piece orchestra. It was followed a year later by the new studio album Systematic Chaos, and in 2009 by Black Clouds & Silver Linings.</p><p>Sherinian went on to record as a soloist and to play with a prog and jazz fusion band, Planet X. Petrucci released an eponymously titled solo album in 2003, featuring accompaniment by Dave LaRue of the Dixie Dregs and Boston-based drummer Dave DeCenso. In late 2010, Mike Mangini joined the group, replacing drummer Mike Portnoy, who left the band in September of that year. With a rigorous touring schedule to firmly break in Mangini, Dream Theater somehow found time to record. They pre-released the track ~On the Backs of Angels~ to YouTube via their label, Roadrunner in June of 2011, followed by the CD release of the aptly titled full-length, A Dramatic Turn of Events, in the fall. </p><p><strong>&mdash;Craig Harris</strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>Dream Theater's Greatest Hit (....And 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs) collection is a strange animal indeed. Despite the band's amazingly longevity -- they cut their first demo in 1986 -- as a touring act and as a steadily selling concern in the product marketplace, they've had exactly one hit, sort of, in 1992's ~Pull Me Under~ from the album Images and Words. That they are still together and still a viable touring and recording enterprise is testament enough in these strange times. Apparently, though, that's not enough for them. Drummer Mike Portnoy and his bandmembers assembled this collection with a few twists that make for rather curious listening. Divided into two discs collecting 22 cuts, the first oddity is that the epic, intricate pro-pop metallic jams they are most closely associated with are almost entirely absent here. In their place, as Portnoy goes to great lengths to explain in his liner notes (which amount to more of an apologia than anything else), are a ~dark side~ disc reflecting the more riff-centric, metallic, guitar and double bass drum tunes that have been influenced by everyone from Black Sabbath and Judas Priest to Iron Maiden and Metallica. The other disc, is, predictably enough, the ~light side.~ Here, the tunes reflect the more melodic, accessibly progressive aspect of the band that has been influenced by, ~...U2, Pink Floyd, Journey, and Peter Gabriel.~ Whatever. What's worse, Portnoy somehow thinks that this set is for the uninitiated, and claims he sees it almost as a ~TV commercial or a coming attraction for a film...something that will lure the viewers/listeners in and inspire them to dig deeper, eventually leading them to experience the 'full picture'...~ Apparently, he hasn't been paying attention to what's been going on in a marketplace increasingly reliant on digital media.</p><p>As for the music itself, here's the rub: the only real thing to attract veteran fans are some 2007 remixes including ~Pull Me Under~ (they messed with their sole pop culture classic!!!!), ~Take the Time,~ and ~Another Day,~ and edits that include shortened versions of ~Lie,~ ~Home,~ ~Misunderstood,~ and ~Solitary Shell.~ There is also an alternate album mix of the track ~Through Her Eyes.~ The cover sticker reflects this, but the actual track listing on the back of the package does not. Musically, if you are a Dream Theater fan and need to have everything, you already know these tracks, and have them in at least two versions -- live and studio -- anyway, and the remixes are nothing whatsoever to write home about. If you are a novice, you'd be better of picking up one of the band's truly classic recordings such as Images and Words, Change of Seasons, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, or Scenes from a Memory to hear their studio magic, on the one hand, or, Live Scenes from New York on the other. This double-disc makes little sense. Excess is one of the greatest things about Dream Theater: they are one of the best live bands on the planet and understand that big rock & roll is about the show as well as great musicianship, but sometimes, even grand excess is a little to o grand for its own good; this is just such a case.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"firstname": "Bob",
		"lastname": "Dylan",
		"name": "Bob Dylan",
		"biography": "<p>Bob Dylan's influence on popular music is incalculable. As a songwriter, he pioneered several different schools of pop songwriting, from confessional singer/songwriter to winding, hallucinatory, stream-of-consciousness narratives. As a vocalist, he broke down the notion that a singer must have a conventionally good voice in order to perform, thereby redefining the vocalist's role in popular music. As a musician, he sparked several genres of pop music, including electrified folk-rock and country-rock. And that just touches on the tip of his achievements. Dylan's force was evident during his height of popularity in the '60s -- the Beatles' shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-'60s never would have happened without him -- but his influence echoed throughout several subsequent generations, as many of his songs became popular standards and his best albums became undisputed classics of the rock & roll canon. Dylan's influence throughout folk music was equally powerful, and he marks a pivotal turning point in its 20th century evolution, signifying when the genre moved away from traditional songs and toward personal songwriting. Even when his sales declined in the '80s and '90s, Dylan's presence rarely lagged, and his commercial revival in the 2000s proved his staying power.</p><p>For a figure of such substantial influence, Dylan came from humble beginnings. Born in Duluth, Minnesota, Bob Dylan (b. Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) was raised in Hibbing, Minnesota, from the age of six. As a child he learned how to play guitar and harmonica, forming a rock & roll band called the Golden Chords when he was in high school. Following his graduation in 1959, he began studying art at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. While at college, he began performing folk songs at coffeehouses under the name Bob Dylan, taking his last name from the poet Dylan Thomas. Already inspired by Hank Williams and Woody Guthrie, Dylan began listening to blues while at college, and the genre wove its way into his music. He spent the summer of 1960 in Denver, where he met bluesman Jesse Fuller, the inspiration behind the songwriter's signature harmonica rack and guitar. By the time he returned to Minneapolis in the fall, he had grown substantially as a performer and was determined to become a professional musician.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/MI0001959588.jpg~ alt=~The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan~><p>Dylan made his way to New York City in January of 1961, immediately making a substantial impression on the folk community of Greenwich Village. He began visiting his idol Guthrie in the hospital, where he was slowly dying from Huntington's chorea. Dylan also began performing in coffeehouses, and his rough charisma won him a significant following. In April, he opened for John Lee Hooker at Gerde's Folk City. Five months later, Dylan performed another concert at the venue, which was reviewed positively by Robert Shelton in The New York Times. Columbia A&R man John Hammond sought out Dylan on the strength of the review, and signed the songwriter in the fall of 1961. Hammond produced Dylan's eponymous debut album (released in March 1962), a collection of folk and blues standards that boasted only two original songs. Over the course of 1962, Dylan began to write a large batch of original songs, many of which were political protest songs in the vein of his Greenwich Village contemporaries. These songs were showcased on his second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. Before its release, Freewheelin' went through several incarnations. Dylan had recorded a rock & roll single, ~Mixed Up Confusion,~ at the end of 1962, but his manager, Albert Grossman, made sure the record was deleted because he wanted to present Dylan as an acoustic folkie. Similarly, several tracks with a full backing band that were recorded for Freewheelin' were scrapped before the album's release. Furthermore, several tracks recorded for the album -- including ~Talking John Birch Society Blues~ -- were eliminated from the album before its release.</p><p>Comprised entirely of original songs, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan made a huge impact in the U.S. folk community, and many performers began covering songs from the album. Of these, the most significant were Peter, Paul and Mary, who made ~Blowin' in the Wind~ into a huge pop hit in the summer of 1963 and thereby made Bob Dylan into a recognizable household name. On the strength of Peter, Paul and Mary's cover and his opening gigs for popular folkie Joan Baez, Freewheelin' became a hit in the fall of 1963, climbing to number 23 on the charts. By that point, Baez and Dylan had become romantically involved, and she was beginning to record his songs frequently. Dylan was writing just as fast.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/MI0002208215.jpg~ alt=~The Times They Are A-Changin'~/><p>By the time The Times They Are A-Changin' was released in early 1964, Dylan's songwriting had developed far beyond that of his New York peers. Heavily inspired by poets like Arthur Rimbaud and John Keats, his writing took on a more literate and evocative quality. Around the same time, he began to expand his musical boundaries, adding more blues and R&B influences to his songs. Released in the summer of 1964, Another Side of Bob Dylan made these changes evident. However, Dylan was moving faster than his records could indicate. By the end of 1964, he had ended his romantic relationship with Baez and had begun dating a former model named Sara Lowndes, whom he subsequently married. Simultaneously, he gave the Byrds ~Mr. Tambourine Man~ to record for their debut album. The Byrds gave the song a ringing, electric arrangement, but by the time the single became a hit, Dylan was already exploring his own brand of folk-rock.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/MI0002424512.jpg~ alt=~Bringing It All Back Home~/><p>Inspired by the British Invasion, particularly the Animals' version of ~House of the Rising Sun,~ Dylan recorded a set of original songs backed by a loud rock & roll band for his next album. While Bringing It All Back Home (March 1965) still had a side of acoustic material, it made clear that Dylan had turned his back on folk music. For the folk audience, the true breaking point arrived a few months after the album's release, when he played the Newport Folk Festival supported by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. The audience greeted him with vicious derision, but he had already been accepted by the growing rock & roll community. Dylan's spring tour of Britain was the basis for D.A. Pennebaker's documentary <em>Don't Look Back</em>, a film that captures the songwriter's edgy charisma and charm.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/MI0002523555.jpg~ alt=~Highway 61 Revisited~/><p>Dylan made his breakthrough to the pop audience in the summer of 1965, when ~Like a Rolling Stone~ became a number two hit. Driven by a circular organ riff and a steady beat, the six-minute single broke the barrier of the three-minute pop single. Dylan became the subject of innumerable articles, and his lyrics became the subject of literary analyses across the U.S. and U.K. Well over 100 artists covered his songs between 1964 and 1966; the Byrds and the Turtles, in particular, had big hits with his compositions. Highway 61 Revisited, his first full-fledged rock & roll album, became a Top Ten hit shortly after its summer 1965 release. ~Positively 4th Street~ and ~Rainy Day Women #12 & 35~ became Top Ten hits in the fall of 1965 and spring of 1966, respectively. Following the May 1966 release of the double album Blonde on Blonde, he had sold over ten million records around the world.</p><p>During the fall of 1965, Dylan hired the Hawks, formerly Ronnie Hawkins' backing group, as his touring band. the Hawks, who changed their name to the Band in 1968, would become Dylan's most famous backing band, primarily because of their intuitive chemistry and ~wild, thin mercury sound,~ but also because of their British tour in the spring of 1966. The tour was the first time the British had heard the electric Dylan, and their reaction was disagreeable and violent. At the Manchester concert (long mistakenly identified as the show from London's Royal Albert Hall), an audience member called Dylan ~Judas,~ inspiring a positively vicious version of ~Like a Rolling Stone~ from Dylan and the band. The performance was immortalized on countless bootleg albums (an official release finally surfaced in 1998), and it indicates the intensity of Dylan in the middle of 1966. He had assumed control of Pennebaker's second Dylan documentary, <em>Eat the Document</em>, and was under deadline to complete his book <em>Tarantula</em>, as well as record a new record. Following the British tour, he returned to America.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/MI0002204879.jpg~ alt=~The Basement Tapes~/><p>On July 29, 1966, he was injured in a motorcycle accident outside of his home in Woodstock, New York, suffering injuries to his neck vertebrae and a concussion. Details of the accident remain elusive -- he was reportedly in critical condition for a week and had amnesia -- and some biographers have questioned its severity, but the event was a pivotal turning point in his career. After the accident, Dylan became a recluse, disappearing into his home in Woodstock and raising his family with his wife, Sara. After a few months, he retreated with the Band to a rented house, subsequently dubbed Big Pink, in West Saugerties to record a number of demos. For several months, Dylan and the Band recorded an enormous amount of material, ranging from old folk, country, and blues songs to newly written originals. The songs indicated that Dylan's songwriting had undergone a metamorphosis, becoming streamlined and more direct. Similarly, his music had changed, owing less to traditional rock & roll, and demonstrating heavy country, blues, and traditional folk influences. None of the Big Pink recordings was intended to be released, but tapes from the sessions were circulated by Dylan's music publisher with the intent of generating cover versions. Copies of these tapes, as well as other songs, were available on illegal bootleg albums by the end of the '60s; it was the first time that bootleg copies of unreleased recordings became widely circulated. Portions of the tapes were officially released in 1975 as the double album The Basement Tapes.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/MI0000692793.jpg~ alt=~John Wesley Harding~/><p>While Dylan was in seclusion, rock & roll had become heavier and artier in the wake of the psychedelic revolution. When Dylan returned with John Wesley Harding in December of 1967, its quiet, country ambience was a surprise to the general public, but it was a significant hit, peaking at number two in the U.S. and number one in the U.K. Furthermore, the record arguably became the first significant country-rock record to be released, setting the stage for efforts by the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers later in 1969.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/MI0001512636.jpg~ alt=~Nashville Skyline~/><p>Dylan followed his country inclinations on his next album, 1969's Nashville Skyline, which was recorded in Nashville with several of the country industry's top session men. While the album was a hit, spawning the Top Ten single ~Lay Lady Lay,~ it was criticized in some quarters for uneven material. The mixed reception was the beginning of a full-blown backlash that arrived with the double album Self Portrait. Released early in June of 1970, the album was a hodgepodge of covers, live tracks, re-interpretations, and new songs greeted with negative reviews from all quarters of the press. Dylan followed the album quickly with New Morning, which was hailed as a comeback.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/MI0002243730.jpg~ alt=~Dylan [1973]~/><p>Following the release of New Morning, Dylan began to wander restlessly. He moved back to Greenwich Village, he finally published <em>Tarantula</em> in November of 1970, and he performed at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. During 1972, he began his acting career by playing Alias in Sam Peckinpah's <em>Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid</em>, which was released in 1973. He also wrote the soundtrack for the film, which featured ~Knockin' on Heaven's Door,~ his biggest hit since ~Lay Lady Lay.~ The <em>Pat Garrett</em> soundtrack was the final record released under his Columbia contract before he moved to David Geffen's fledgling Asylum Records. As retaliation, Columbia assembled Dylan, a collection of Self Portrait outtakes, for release at the end of 1973. Dylan only recorded two albums -- including 1974's Planet Waves, coincidentally his first number one album -- before he moved back to Columbia. The Band supported Dylan on Planet Waves and its accompanying tour, which became the most successful tour in rock & roll history; it was captured on 1974's double live album Before the Flood.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/MI0001462461.jpg~ alt=~Blood on the Tracks~/><p>Dylan's 1974 tour was the beginning of a comeback culminating with 1975's Blood on the Tracks. Largely inspired by the disintegration of his marriage, Blood on the Tracks was hailed as a return to form by critics and it became his second number one album. After jamming with folkies in Greenwich Village, Dylan decided to launch a gigantic tour, loosely based on traveling medicine shows. Lining up an extensive list of supporting musicians -- including Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Arlo Guthrie, Mick Ronson, Roger McGuinn, and poet Allen Ginsberg -- Dylan dubbed the tour the Rolling Thunder Revue and set out on the road in the fall of 1975. For the next year, the Rolling Thunder Revue toured on and off, with Dylan filming many of the concerts for a future film. During the tour, Desire was released to considerable acclaim and success, spending five weeks on the top of the charts. Throughout the Rolling Thunder Revue, Dylan showcased ~Hurricane,~ a protest song he had written about boxer Rubin Carter, who had been unjustly imprisoned for murder. The live album Hard Rain was released at the end of the tour. Dylan released <em>Renaldo and Clara</em>, a four-hour film based on the Rolling Thunder tour, to poor reviews in early 1978.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/MI0002152702.jpg~ alt=~Street Legal~/><p>Early in 1978, Dylan set out on another extensive tour, this time backed by a band that resembled a Las Vegas lounge act. The group was featured on the 1978 album Street Legal and the 1979 live album At Budokan. At the conclusion of the tour in late 1978, Dylan announced that he was a born-again Christian, and he launched a series of Christian albums that following summer with Slow Train Coming. Though the reviews were mixed, the album was a success, peaking at number three and going platinum. His supporting tour for Slow Train Coming featured only his new religious material, much to the bafflement of his long-term fans. Two other religious albums -- Saved (1980) and Shot of Love (1981) -- followed, both to poor reviews. In 1982, Dylan traveled to Israel, sparking rumors that his conversion to Christianity was short-lived. He returned to secular recording with 1983's Infidels, which was greeted with favorable reviews.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/MI0000692914.jpg~ alt=~Real Live~/><p>Dylan returned to performing in 1984, releasing the live album Real Live at the end of the year. Empire Burlesque followed in 1985, but its odd mix of dance tracks and rock & roll won few fans. However, the five-album/triple-disc retrospective box set Biograph appeared that same year to great acclaim. In 1986, Dylan hit the road with Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers for a successful and acclaimed tour, but his album that year, Knocked Out Loaded, was received poorly. The following year, he toured with the Grateful Dead as his backing band; two years later, the souvenir album Dylan & the Dead appeared.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/MI0002539001.jpg~ alt=~The Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 1~/><p>In 1988, Dylan embarked on what became known as ~the Never-Ending Tour~ -- a constant stream of shows that ran on and off into the late '90s. That same year, he appeared on The Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 1 -- by the supergroup also featuring George Harrison, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne -- and released his own Down in the Groove, an album largely comprising covers. The Never-Ending Tour received far stronger reviews than Down in the Groove (the Traveling Wilburys album fared much better), but 1989's Oh Mercy was his most acclaimed album since 1975's Blood on the Tracks, due in part to Daniel Lanois' strong production. However, Dylan's 1990 follow-up, Under the Red Sky (issued the same year as the second album by the Traveling Wilburys, now a quartet following the death of Roy Orbison shortly after the release of the Wilburys' first long-player in 1988), was received poorly, especially when compared to the enthusiastic reception for the 1991 box set The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased), a collection of previously unreleased outtakes and rarities.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/MI0000693010.jpg~ alt=~Good as I Been to You~/><p>For the remainder of the '90s, Dylan divided his time between live concerts, painting, and studio projects. He returned to recording in 1992 with Good as I Been to You, an acoustic collection of traditional folk songs. It was followed in 1993 by another folk record, World Gone Wrong, which won the Grammy for Best Traditional Folk Album. After the release of World Gone Wrong, Dylan released a greatest-hits album and a live record.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/MI0000138934.jpg~ alt=~Time Out of Mind~/><p>Dylan released Time Out of Mind, his first album of original material in seven years, in the fall of 1997. Time Out of Mind received his strongest reviews in years and unexpectedly debuted in the Top Ten, eventually climbing to platinum certification. Such success sparked a revival of interest in Dylan, who appeared on the cover of Newsweek and began selling out concerts once again. Early in 1998, Time Out of Mind received three Grammy Awards -- Album of the Year, Best Contemporary Folk Album, and Best Male Rock Vocal.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/MI0002037818.jpg~ alt=~Love and Theft~/><p>Another album of original material, Love and Theft, followed in 2001 and went gold. Soon after its release, Dylan announced that he was making his own film, to star Jeff Bridges, Penelope Cruz, John Goodman, Val Kilmer, and many more. The accompanying soundtrack, Masked and Anonymous, was released in July 2003. Dylan opted to self-produce his new studio album, Modern Times, which topped the Billboard charts and went platinum in both America and the U.K. It was Dylan's third consecutive album to receive praise from critics and support from consumers, and it was followed three years later in 2009 by Together Through Life, another self-produced effort (as Jack Frost) that also featured contributions from David Hidalgo of Los Lobos and Mike Campbell of Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers. He capped off the year with an old-fashioned holiday effort, Christmas in the Heart. Proceeds from the album were donated to various charities around the world.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/MI0003399814.jpg~ alt=~Tempest~/><p>Dylan released the self-produced (again as Jack Frost) Tempest on September 11, 2012; it debuted at three on both the Billboard 200 and the U.K. charts. The next two years brought acclaimed entries in the ongoing <em>Bootleg Series</em> -- 2013 saw the release of Another Self Portrait (1969-1971), which restored the reputation of a much-maligned era, and 2014 saw the long-awaited appearance of The Basement Tapes Complete -- and then Dylan threw a curveball for his next studio album. Released in February 2015, Shadows in the Night found the singer/songwriter devoting himself to selections from the Great American Songbook in the pre-rock & roll era. Every one of the ten songs had previously been recorded by Frank Sinatra, and Dylan's album was his version of Sinatra's saloon songs, arranged by his own touring band.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>    ",

				"review": "<p>Bob Dylan's first album is a lot like the debut albums by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones -- a sterling effort, outclassing most, if not all, of what came before it in the genre, but similarly eclipsed by the artist's own subsequent efforts. The difference was that not very many people heard Bob Dylan on its original release (originals on the early-'60s Columbia label are choice collectibles) because it was recorded with a much smaller audience and musical arena in mind. At the time of Bob Dylan's release, the folk revival was rolling, and interpretation was considered more important than original composition by most of that audience. A significant portion of the record is possessed by the style and spirit of Woody Guthrie, whose influence as a singer and guitarist hovers over ~Man of Constant Sorrow~ and ~Pretty Peggy-O,~ as well as the two originals here, the savagely witty ~Talkin' New York~ and the poignant ~Song to Woody~; and it's also hard to believe that he wasn't aware of Jimmie Rodgers and Roy Acuff when he cut ~Freight Train Blues.~ But on other songs, one can also hear the influences of Bukka White, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Blind Willie Johnson, and Furry Lewis, in the playing and singing, and this is where Dylan departed significantly from most of his contemporaries.

				"review": "<p>Bob Dylan's first album is a lot like the debut albums by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones -- a sterling effort, outclassing most, if not all, of what came before it in the genre, but similarly eclipsed by the artist's own subsequent efforts. The difference was that not very many people heard Bob Dylan on its original release (originals on the early-'60s Columbia label are choice collectibles) because it was recorded with a much smaller audience and musical arena in mind. At the time of Bob Dylan's release, the folk revival was rolling, and interpretation was considered more important than original composition by most of that audience. A significant portion of the record is possessed by the style and spirit of Woody Guthrie, whose influence as a singer and guitarist hovers over ~Man of Constant Sorrow~ and ~Pretty Peggy-O,~ as well as the two originals here, the savagely witty ~Talkin' New York~ and the poignant ~Song to Woody~; and it's also hard to believe that he wasn't aware of Jimmie Rodgers and Roy Acuff when he cut ~Freight Train Blues.~ But on other songs, one can also hear the influences of Bukka White, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Blind Willie Johnson, and Furry Lewis, in the playing and singing, and this is where Dylan departed significantly from most of his contemporaries. Other white folksingers of the era, including his older contemporaries Eric Von Schmidt and Dave Van Ronk, had incorporated blues in their work, but Dylan's presentation was more in your face, resembling in some respects (albeit in a more self-conscious way) the work of John Hammond, Jr., the son of the man who signed Dylan to Columbia Records and produced this album, who was just starting out in his own career at the time this record was made.

				"review": "<p>The mysterious tape of early Bob Dylan performances said to have been recorded at the Gaslight Café in Greenwich Village in 1962 began turning up on bootleg albums such as Ode for Barbara Allen, The Gaslight Tapes, Dylan '62, and Barbed Wire Blues in the 1970s. In 1991, one track, ~No More Auction Block,~ earned legitimate release on The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased), but this ten-track disc is the first extensive issuance of the material in legal form. The mystery of the origins of the recordings remains, however. Dylan scholars tend to date them from the fall of 1962, but there is no assurance they were actually made at the Gaslight, and tapes circulating among collectors contain more songs than the 11 now commercially available. (Among the missing songs is an early version of ~Ballad of Hollis Brown,~ later heard on 1964's The Times They Are a-Changin'.) Nevertheless, this album is a valuable missing link between Dylan's self-titled debut album (released in March 1962), which consisted mostly of cover tunes, and The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan (released in May 1963), which unveiled Dylan the songwriter. Most of the songs Dylan performs here are covers, but there are early versions of ~A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall~ and ~Don't Think Twice, It's All Right,~ two of the major songs that would appear on The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, as well as ~Rocks and Gravel~ (a free-form adaptation of Brownie McGhee's ~Solid Road~ and Leroy Carr's ~Alabama Woman Blues~), which was recorded for The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan and even included on its initial version, and the antiwar ~John Brown,~ later recorded for the various-artists album Broadside Ballads, Vol. 1. Those songs reveal Dylan's emerging songwriting talent (the lyrics of ~Don't Think Twice, It's All Right~ don't even seem quite finished), while the other six songs are more reminiscent of the gruff traditional folksinger of the Bob Dylan album, though one who can be gentler (~Barbara Allen~) and more provocative (~Cocaine~) than he seemed on his first LP. The recordings are considerably clearer than the bootleg versions, but they retain their unofficial quality, with occasional flaws, the most notable of which is the abrupt ending of the final track, ~West Texas.~ [Live at the Gaslight 1962 was made available initially only at Starbucks coffee shops and at the Starbucks-owned Web site]</p>&mdash; <b>William Ruhlmann</b>"

Some showed up on The Bootleg Series and Biograph, but others have stayed in the vault. This is a superb 25-song compilation of the best unreleased material from the 1962 studio sessions, including interesting originals like ~The Ballad of Hollis Brown,~ ~The Death of Emmett Till,~ and ~Let Me Die in My Footsteps~; a bunch of solid folk and blues covers like ~Baby Please Don't Go~ and ~Milk Cow Blues~; and alternates of a few tracks that were released, notably ~Corrina, Corrina~ and ~Mixed Up Confusion.~ Most fascinating of all are several tracks featuring electric band accompaniment, including the aforementioned ~Corrina, Corrina~ and ~Mixed Up Confusion,~ but also ~That's All Right,~ the Arthur Crudup blues covered on Elvis Presley's first single. The sound is excellent, and while the official Freewheelin' had much stronger and more innovative original material, the performances on this collection (featuring multiple versions of some songs) are extremely strong and assured. This is absolutely essential for Dylan fans, and one of the relatively few bootlegs that can be unequivocally recommended to general music consumers, not just specialist collectors. There's even an outtake from the Freewheelin' photo session on the cover.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

The Halloween gig at Philharmonic Hall in New York was a special part of the tour for <i>Another Side of Bob Dylan</i>, arguably his greatest acoustic recording. What's more poignant, however, is how it previews the material on <i>Bringing It All Back Home</i>. While the songs on Another Side hinted at things to come, nothing could have prepared audiences for the dreamy surrealism of ~Mr. Tambourine Man,~ or the nightmarish abstract poetry of ~It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),~ and ~Gates of Eden~ -- all of which appear on Disc One. The remainder of the material comes from Dylan's preceding catalog; there are stirring protest and topical songs, folk songs, humorous narratives, love songs, great wisecracks, and talking blues -- ~Talking John Birch Paranoid Blues!~), most of them classics -- ~With God on Our Side,~ ~Hard Rain's Gonna Fall,~ ~Times They Are A-Changin',~ ~Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,~ ~Don't Think Twice, It's Alright,~ ~Mama You've Been on My Mind,~ ~All I Really Want to Do,~ ~It Ain't Me Babe~ -- all of these songs and many others (there are 17 in all) are delivered with the confidence of the seasoned performer; a man who knows his audience and how to handle them. It's not cynical, not detached, just masterful. For those unfamiliar with this set, Joan Baez makes an appearance near the end of the show, and duets with Dylan on four cuts including an amazing read of ~Silver Dagger.~ It is true that if you possess the boot, you have all the music here, and chances are, it has some pretty good sound. But you'll need this version, too. For starters, the sound is spectacular, wonderfully warm and immediate, and the transfer is extremely clean with wonderful dynamics. Secondly, the package is deluxe. In addition to a fine essay by Princeton historian and author Sean Wilentz (he made the gig when he was 13), there are a truckload of killer photos from the show and the period, along with complete discographical information that puts the bootleg packages to shame. For those interested in the acoustic Bob Dylan, this concert is like the grail; his voice is in impeccable shape, and his delivery is revelatory. For those interested in the transition from acoustic to electric, this show is the seam, and for those who are die-hard fans, this is another welcome item in the official catalog.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

				"review": "<P>Sometime in late 1965 or early 1966, Bob Dylan gave a cache of acetates from the recording sessions that yielded his classic LP Another Side of Bob Dylan to Emmett Grogan, a co-founder of the radical Haight-Ashbury community group the Diggers as well as the author of the cult-classic memoir Ringolevio. Although Grogan died in 1978, the tapes in question did not resurface until early 1995, at which point they were the subject of furious pirating among Dylan bootleggers; the two-disc As Good as It Gets remains the definitive compilation of this material in terms of both sound and packaging, adding demos from the legendary Highway 61 Revisited sessions to paint an authoritative portrait of Dylan's evolution from folk to rock &amp; roll. The revelation of the set is a version of ~Mr. Tambourine Man~ that is far slower and more melancholy than the official release, complete with harmonies from Ramblin' Jack Elliott. ~All I Wanna Do~ is similarly fascinating thanks to the inclusion of an extra verse excised from subsequent renditions.</P><P>— <B>Jason Ankeny</B></P>"

				"review": "<p>Like any fledgling songwriter, Bob Dylan signed with a publishing company at the outset of his career. Publishers are standard practice for songwriters -- it’s where the money comes in, as songs are published, performed, and covered -- but in the early ‘60s there was an expectation that publishers would help place songs in the hands of appropriate singers, a practice Dylan effectively ended by popularizing writers singing their own songs, but in 1962, this self-sufficiency was a rarity. Even his 1962 debut contained only three Dylan originals, which in his case reflected his traditional folk roots, but Dylan needed a publisher for those three songs so John Hammond, who signed the singer/songwriter to Columbia, pointed him toward Leeds Music. Dylan cut a demo session for Leeds between the recording and release of Bob Dylan and when that album wound up stiffing, Leeds let him buy out his contract in the summer of 1962, which then led to him signing with M. Witmark & Sons publishing company. Between 1962 and 1964, a period that roughly spanned “Blowin’ in the Wind” to “Mr. Tambourine Man,” Dylan cut several demo sessions for Witmark, usually with the intent of the publisher pitching songs to other singers. Many of his early classics were first essayed here -- “A Hard-Rain’s Gonna Fall,” “Masters of War,” “Don’t Think Twice It’s Alright,” “Boots of Spanish Leather,” “Girl from the North Country,” “The Times They Are A-Changin’” -- and he also cut songs he never revisited. Some wound up with other artists -- “Seven Curses,” “Tomorrow Is a Long Time,” “Mama, You Been on My Mind” -- some were lost to time, leaking out on bootlegs until they officially surfaced on 2010’s The Bootleg Series, Vol. 9: The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964.</p><p>Many of these recordings have been heavily bootlegged, some excerpted on previous Bootleg Series, but they’ve never been presented as completely and in as great fidelity as they are on this two-disc set. Great fidelity seems almost unnecessary for such simple recordings, although the cleanliness enhances the intimacy, so familiar songs are lent freshness when surrounded by the thumping of a microphone or closing of a door. This disarming intimacy -- verging on eavesdropping -- is as attractive as the 15 songs that never appeared on an official Dylan album. Some of these songs are throwaways -- “Bound to Lose, Bound to Win” lacks finished verses, with Bob promising that he’ll write them down later -- but there’s considerable charm in hearing Dylan tossing off a song, plus some of these half-forgotten discards, like “Guess I’m Doing Fine” and “All Over You,” are still quite strong. Nevertheless, the real appeal of this volume of the Bootleg Series is to listen as Dylan develops as a songwriter and artist. The songs spilled forth at an astonishing rate, and the great majority were not only superb, they were different from what came before, with his Woody Guthrie homage quickly replaced by a quick-witted protest singer who then started to delve into the personal in revolutionary ways. At its core, these demos are the sound of Dylan becoming Bob Dylan, and it's an evolution that’s spellbinding.</p><h4>In Concert At Brandeis University</h4><p>Originally released on Amazon as a bonus disc for early purchasers of 2010’s The Bootleg Series, Vol. 9 and The Original Mono Recordings, Bob Dylan in Concert: Brandeis University 1963 saw a wide release in the spring of 2011. Unlike the archival concerts that have popped up in The Bootleg Series, Brandeis University 1963 isn’t a major statement. At seven songs, it’s brief and there’s no mythology behind the show; a recording wasn’t even known to exist until a tape was found within the collection of music critic Ralph J. Gleason in 2009. It may be minor, but as a live recording of Dylan between the release of his debut and The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan, it is certainly noteworthy, a glimpse of Dylan working folk festival bills unencumbered by fame or legend. He chooses topical songs for his two sets, bypassing “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” and “Blowin’ in the Wind” in favor of “Masters of War,” “Talkin’ John Birch Paranoid Blues,” “The Ballad of Hollis Brown,” “Talkin’ World War III Blues,” and “Talkin' Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues,” material that accentuates the show’s roots in May of 1963. Dylan is in good form, open and sometimes skirting on the edge of being lively, never quite revealing that it was slightly risky to entertain a festival audience with a collection of originals previously unheard by the crowd. If the show doesn’t quite manage to be memorable, it is certainly engaging, a worthwhile 38 minutes even if it doesn’t quite have much more than a historic hook to warrant repeated plays.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>The best documentary movie ever made about a single rock artist (although Dylan wasn't really a rocker when much of it was shot). It's all about Dylan's 1965 British tour and the frantic scene that surrounded him. A minor flaw: it doesn't get any better than the opening conceptual video of ~Subterranean Homesick Blues.~</p><p><b>&mdash; Bruce Eder</b></p><hr/><p>Director D.A. Pennebaker's black-and-white 1967 documentary film Don't Look Back largely chronicles Bob Dylan's tour of the U.K. in the spring of 1965, the last outing on which the not-quite-24-year-old singer/songwriter appeared solo, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica. Already, however, he had begun to move toward folk-rock, having just recorded and released his LP Bringing It All Back Home, half of which consisted of arrangements featuring electric instruments. That he is in a transitional phase in his development comes out early, as the film opens with what is in effect an early music video, in which he stands in a an alley holding and discarding a pile of posters featuring words from his current folk-rock single, ~Subterranean Homesick Blues,~ as the record plays on the soundtrack. Then begins the film proper, as Pennebaker's hand-held camera follows him from his arrival in England on April 28, 1965, to his final concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London on May 10. Right off the bat, the director's major theme, Dylan's relationship with the news media, emerges in a press conference at which mass-market journalists, skeptically treating him as a phenomenon, ask hostile questions couched in posh English accents. ~Do you think that a lot of the young people who buy your records understand a single word of what you're singing?,~ asks a woman, following up with, ~Would you say that you cared about people particularly?~ Dylan responds jokingly and good naturedly at first. But later in the film, as he reads or has read to him articles and reviews written about him and continues to encounter journalists backstage, he loses his patience and begins to give as well as he has gotten, and in considerably less calm tones, for example, telling off an unidentified reporter for Time magazine (Horace Judson) in no uncertain terms. It's not hard to hear the songwriter about to turn out ~Ballad of a Thin Man~ in his remarks. Something similar happens as Pennebaker chronicles the backstage and hotel room gatherings at which Dylan encounters fans and fellow musicians; again, things start out friendly enough, but there are also angry outbursts as too many people, some of them drunk, behave badly around the singer and get tongue lashings as a result. Again, the soon-to-be-written ~Positively 4th Street~ comes to mind. Dylan's main entourage consists of Bob Neuwirth, serving as personal assistant, and manager Albert Grossman, who does some shouting of his own and is glimpsed negotiating the terms of a television appearance (probably the one Dylan did for the BBC a few weeks later). Pennebaker also provides some footage of Dylan on-stage at various venues on the tour, although this is not primarily a performance film, and no song is performed in its entirety. Others also give impromptu performances backstage and in hotel rooms, including Alan Price, Joan Baez, and Donovan. When it first appeared in 1967, Don't Look Back was an eye-opening look at the tumultuous life of Bob Dylan circa 1965. It only grew in stature in later years, ranking as a classic examination of the world of popular music as it was lived in the ‘60s.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>~Bob Dylan going electric~ at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival is one of those epochal moments in rock history that seemingly everyone has heard about, but what few people seem to know is that it wasn't some ephemeral event that we only know from word of mouth — filmmaker Murray Lerner documented the performances at the Newport Festival for several years running, and The Other Side of the Mirror collects footage from the three years Dylan appeared at the celebrated folk gathering, allowing us to see Dylan's rise through the folk scene for ourselves. Watching Lerner's documentary, what's most remarkable is how much Dylan changed over the course of 36 months; the young folkie performing at the afternoon ~workshop~ at the side of Joan Baez in 1963 is at once nervy and hesitant, singing his wordy tunes while chopping away at his acoustic guitar and energizing the crowd without seeming to know just what he's doing. In 1964, Dylan all but owns Newport, and he clearly knows it; he's the talk of the Festival, with Baez and Johnny Cash singing his praises (and his songs), and his command of the stage is visibly stronger and more confident while his new material (including ~Mr. Tambourine Man~ and ~It Ain't Me, Babe~) sees him moving away from the ~protest songs~ that first made his name. When the audience demands an encore after Dylan's evening set (Odetta and Dave Van Ronk were scheduled to follow him), Peter Yarrow tries to keep the show moving along while Dylan beams at the crowd's adulation, like the rock star he was quickly becoming.</p><p>By the time the 1965 Newport Festival rolled around, Dylan's epochal ~Like a Rolling Stone~ was starting to scale the singles charts, and the hardcore folk audience was clearly of two minds about his popular (and populist) success. When Dylan, Fender Stratocaster in hand, performs ~Maggie's Farm~ backed by Al Kooper, Mike Bloomfield and the rhythm section from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, the raucous but hard-driving number inspires a curious mixture of enthusiastic cheering and equally emphatic booing, and while legend has it that the version of ~Like a Rolling Stone~ that followed was a shambles, the song cooks despite drummer Sam Lay's difficulty in finding the groove, though if anything the division of the crowd's loyalties is even stronger afterward. After these two numbers, Dylan and his band leave the stage, with Yarrow (once again serving as MC) citing technical problems (if Pete Seeger really pulled the power on Dylan, as legend has it, there's no sign of it here); Dylan returns to the stage with an acoustic six-string to sing ~Mr. Tambourine Man~ and ~It's All Over Now, Baby Blue~ before vanishing into the night without comment. While much of the audience at Newport in 1965 wanted the ~old~ Dylan back, his strong, willful performances even on the acoustic stuff makes it obvious that the scrappy semi-amateur we saw at the beginning of the movie was gone forever, and the ovations suggest more than a few people wanted to see Dylan rock. Lerner's film tells us a certain amount of what we already knows, but it gently debunks a few myths about Dylan during this pivotal moment in his career, and his performances are committed and forceful throughout; no matter how many times you've read about Dylan's Newport shoot-out of 1965, seeing it is a revelatory experience, and Lerner has assembled this archival material with intelligence and taste. This is must-see viewing for anyone interested in Dylan or the folk scene of the '60s.</p><strong>— Mark Deming</strong>"

				"review": "<p>Bob Dylan's transformation from folksinger to rock 'n' roll poet in the mid-sixties horrified many of his early fans. Traditionalists saw his use of loud amplified instruments as a corruption of folk music's purity. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan hit the road with an electric band, confronting his listeners face to face with his new rock oriented sound. Bootleg recordings of these incendiary performances have circulated among collectors for decades. Now the most famous of these bootlegs, known as the ~Royal Albert Hall~ show (even though it comes from the May 17, 1966 performance in Manchester, England and not the later show at the London venue) has finally been officially released. Live 1966: The ~Royal Albert Hall~ Concert documents one of the most fascinating and electrifying concert battles in music history.</p><p>On the first disc of the two CD set, Dylan plays solo, armed with only an acoustic guitar and harmonica. Perhaps because he still carries the tools of a folksinger, the audience responds to Dylan's seven song acoustic set with respectful silence and warm, enthusiastic applause. One listen to the lyrics, however, and it is clear that Dylan is well past the protest songs of his folk music roots. Like the work of the Beat poets, ~Visions of Johanna~ and ~Desolation Row~ pile one surrealistic image on top of another to present a world full of absurdity and madness. Dylan's performance too is otherworldly. His rough ghost of a voice sounds as if it is coming from out of a dream. But Dylan is obviously tuned into every word as he twists and turns the meaning of his prose by emphasizing different aspects of each syllable. The halting tenderness of ~Just Like a Woman~ is breathtaking and the harmonica solos in ~Mr. Tambourine Man~ are so hypnotic that Dylan seems to lose himself in their simple beauty as they spiral around his simple but effective guitar strumming. Asthe first half of the show ends, it appears that Dylan's masterful performance has captivated the skeptics in the audience.</p><p>The sound of electric guitars tuning up opens disc two and warns that the second set is an altogether different story. A distant voice and boot-stomp count in the beat before Dylan and his backing musicians called the Hawks, later named the Band, explode into the opening number, the previously unreleased ~Tell Me, Momma.~ The sound is loud and dense, with Robbie Robertson's splintering guitar riffs and Garth Hudson's hurdy-gurdy keyboards giving the roar a playfully ominous texture, as Dylan shouts like a madman and asks, ~Tell me, Momma. What's wrong with you? This tiiiime?~ The crowd hesitates a moment before applauding as if stunned by the assault. Dylan quickly plays a melody on his harmonica and introduces the next song, saying, ~That was ~I Don't Believe You.~ It used to go like that, now it goes like this.~ A searing rocked-up version of a tune from his folk days follows, coming across like a psychedelic, acid-dosed versionof Buddy Holly.</p><p>The battlelines are drawn. From now on, angry audience members greet each song with shouts and slow rhythmic handclapping to show their disapproval. Yet somehow, Dylan rises to the challenge and puts the protesters in their place every time. At one point, in order to quell the disruptive clapping, Dylan mumbles nonsense into the microphone until people quiet down in order to hear what he's saying. Once the noise subsides, he clearly implores, ~. . . if you only wouldn't clap so hard.~ You gotta hand it to Bob. Who else carries out crowd control with such finesse and humor?</p><p>The music itself is also a response to the hostility in the air. ~Ballad of a Thin Man~ is more menacing than ever. In the charged atmosphere, its chorus, ~You know there's something happening he explains....</p><hr/><p>The most famous bootleg in rock history, with the possible exception of Dylan's own Basement Tapes, finally makes its official appearance 32 years after the event, and nearly 30 years after it started circulating in the underground. Although often identified as a Royal Albert Hall show, this May 17, 1966, concert, in which Dylan played electric material in front of a British audience, was actually recorded in Manchester (hence the unwieldy title with quotes around ~Royal Albert Hall~). Even those who've owned this recording for many a year might be tempted by this official package, as it has been expanded into a two-CD set that not only includes the eight electric rock songs from the original bootleg, but also the seven solo acoustic performances that comprised the first half of the show. It's all in very good fidelity, about as good as any copies you could find through unofficial sources. More importantly, the electric half in particular is an important document of rock history. It captures the point at which Dylan was at his most controversial and hard rocking as he blazes through mid-'60s classics such as ~Like a Rolling Stone~ and ~Ballad of a Thin Man,~ radical electric arrangements of songs that had originally been recorded acoustically (~One Too Many Mornings,~ ~I Don't Believe You~), and the hard rocker ~Tell Me, Momma,~ which Dylan never recorded in the studio. The acoustic disc is not as epochal, but on par with the electric half in the quality of material and performance. On top of everything else there's a 56-page booklet with a fine essay by Dylan's friend Tony Glover (a notable folk musician in his own right). It's not just an interesting adjunct to Dylan's '60s discography; it's as worthy of attention as anything else he recorded during that decade.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>It's virtually impossible to approach No Direction Home without a cluster of fixed ideas. Who doesn't have their own private Dylan? The true excellence of Martin Scorsese's achievement lies in how his documentary shakes us free of our comfortable assumptions. In the process, it plays out on several levels at once, each taking shape as an unfailingly fascinating narrative. There is, of course, the central story of an individual genius staking out his artistic identity. But along with this Bildungsroman come other threads and contexts: most notably, the role of popular culture in postwar America, art's self-reliance versus its social responsibilities, and fans' complicity with the publicity machine in sustaining myths. All of these threads reinforce each other, together weaving the film's intricate texture.</p><p>Scorsese's 200-plus-minute focus on Dylan's earliest years allows for a portrayal of unprecedented depth, with multiple angles: a rich composite photo is the result. The main narrative has an epic quality: it moves from Dylan growing up in cold-war Minnesota through Greenwich Village coffeehouses and the Newport Folk Festival, climaxing in the controversial 1966 U.K. tour that crowned a period of unbridled and explosive creativity. In his transition from Robert Allen Zimmerman to Bob Dylan, we observe him concocting his impossible-to-describe, unique combination of the topical with the archaic, like an ancient oracle. Scorsese was able to access previously unseen footage from the Dylan archives, including performances, press conferences, and recording sessions. He also uses interviews with Dylan's friends, ex-friends, and fellow artists, and, intriguingly, with the notoriously reclusive Dylan himself (who looks back to provide glosses on the early years), fusing what could have turned into a tiresome series of digressions and tangents into a powerful whole as enlightening, eccentric, contradictory, and ultimately irreducible as its subject.</p><p>Some of the deeply personal bits remain unrevealed, but Dylan's preternatural self-assurance acquires a slightly self-deprecating, even comic edge via some of his reflective comments. Alongside the arrogance, we see touching moments of the young artist's reverence for Woody Guthrie and Johnny Cash. Joan Baez, in a poignant confessional mood, comes off well, and the late Allen Ginsberg is so seraphically charming he almost steals the show a few times. A crucial throughline is Dylan's hunger for recognition and ability to shape perceptions so that would be singled out as not just another dime-a-dozen folk singer. It's illuminating--particularly for those familiar with the artist's latter-day aloofness on stage--to see his reactions to audience booing in the wake of his ~betrayal~ in this fuller context. No Direction Home also makes clear--in a way that wasn't possible in D.A. Pennebaker's iconic Don't Look Back--how Dylan's ability to manipulate his persona always, at its core, protects the urge for expression: Dylan's ultimate mandate, as an artist, is never to be pinned down. As Scorsese masterfully shows, the myth around Dylan only grows bigger the more we discover about him.</p>&mdash; <b>Thomas May</b>"

				"review": "<p>The seventh volume of Bob Dylan's Bootleg Series doubles as the soundtrack to No Direction Home, Martin Scorsese's feature-length documentary covering Dylan's career from its beginnings to 1966 (it was aired in two parts on PBS in September 2005 and released in expanded form on DVD that same month). Unlike the previous three installments of The Bootleg Series, which focused exclusively on live concerts, No Direction Home is assembled from a variety of sources, including home recordings, publishing demos, alternate studio takes, and live recordings, with the first disc devoted to early acoustic recordings and the second to electric music. In fact, No Direction Home proceeds chronologically, filling in gaps between the proper albums or, more often, providing a parallel history of the most productive era of Dylan's career. All of this material - with the exception of ~Song to Woody,~ taken from his debut, and a cataclysmic version of ~Like a Rolling Stone~ taken from the Royal Albert Hall show that was released as The Bootleg Series, Vol. 4 - is previously unreleased, and much of it has not been widely bootlegged (and the cuts that have been bootlegged, such as ~Dink's Song,~ have never been heard in such crystal-clear fidelity). Where the inaugural edition of The Bootleg Series had many previously unreleased Dylan originals, there is only one here, the tentative opener, ~When I Got Troubles,~ a sweet, simple 1959 song that finds Dylan in his formative stage. In place of unheard songs are a slew of alternate versions of familiar tunes. On the first disc, these are largely live versions of such warhorses as ~Blowin' in the Wind,~ ~Masters of War,~ and ~A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall,~ recorded when the songs were still fresh. These live performances have an immediacy and intimacy that not only illustrate what a powerful folksinger Dylan was, but also suggest how the songs might have sounded when they were new tunes. Toward the end of the first disc, alternate versions that are significantly different from the final versions begin to surface with an early take on ~Mr. Tambourine Man~ recorded at the Another Side of Bob Dylan sessions with Ramblin' Jack Elliott on second guitar and backing vocals. The second disc has several alternates that are similarly notably different, highlighted by a lively, careening ~It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry~ with a different final verse, a ~Desolation Row~ with electric guitar, ~Highway 61 Revisited~ without the siren whistle, a slower, heavier, blusier take on ~Leopard-Skin Pill Box Hat,~ a relaxed version of ~Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again~ that lacks the carnivalesque swirl of sound from the Blonde on Blonde version, and a lean, insistent ~Visions of Johanna.~</p><p>As different as some of these versions are, there are no great revelations here, apart from the realization that the best takes really did make the finished records. But looking for revelations on this seventh edition of The Bootleg Series may be setting the bar too high, particularly because even if few things here are earth-shaking (a rampaging ~Maggie's Farm~ from Dylan's legendary electric set at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 could qualify, thanks in great deal to an incendiary Mike Bloomfield), everything here is uniformly excellent and worth hearing well more than once. That alone, of course, would make this yet another worthwhile addition to any serious Dylan collection, but what makes No Direction Home noteworthy as an album is that it is the first Dylan record to offer an aural biography of Dylan. This does a superb job of tracing the development of Dylan as a musician, taking him from a young folkie singing standards, through the rush of his early standards, and to the visionary music he made once he went electric. Put in this context, the electric music on disc two sounds as bracing and brilliant and surprising as it did in the '60s, while the acoustic folk on disc one sounds vibrant, pure, and alive. After all these years, that's a hard accomplishment to pull off, and to the credit of everybody involved in this terrific release, they've been able to make even the most familiar Dylan tunes feel new again.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<p>~I'll do this one more time and if I can't do it, we'll do another song. I'll do any song as good as I can do it the first time.~</p><p>Bob Dylan says these words once his first solo take of ~Love Minus Zero/No Limit~ breaks down after a minute. Dylan's definition of ~good~ is fluid, of course. Sometimes, a first take satisfied him -- ~Maggie's Farm~ and ~Gates of Eden~ are two prime examples -- but often he'd find he could do a song better or at least do it differently, swapping out words, speeding up the tempo, and changing the feel, occasionally radically transforming his song. Sometimes, these radical transformations are the versions that found their way to the finished record, so they're now seen as etched in stone but The Cutting Edge 1965-1966, the 12th volume of The Bootleg Series, shows Dylan didn't enter the studio with posterity in mind when he went to cut Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde: he was making music of and for the moment.</p><p>Familiarity hasn't necessarily dulled the impact of these three records, all written and recorded within a span of 14 months -- a period of time when Dylan also filmed Don't Look Back, electrified the Newport Folk Festival, and was declared a Judas at the Royal Albert Hall -- but they have made them seem inevitable, works carved out of granite whose fates were preordained. The gift of The Cutting Edge is that it makes this, the greatest run of creativity in Dylan's career and perhaps in rock & roll in general, once again seems wild, nervy, and quicksilver, upending expectations and undercutting conventions. Within one of the three sets of liner notes, Bill Flanagan calls these six discs of outtakes, alternates, and rehearsals ~work tapes,~ which is technically true, but undersells how this music crackles as it shape-shifts, sometimes soaring, sometimes stumbling, but always feeling fiercely alive. If it's difficult to claim that a solo ~Bob Dylan's 115th Dream~ and a locomotive ~Visions of Johanna~ recorded with the Band are superior to the versions on Home and Blonde, they're nevertheless magnificent in their own right while also shedding light on how Dylan worked; with producer Tom Wilson, the singer/songwriter wasted no time, while Bob Johnston allowed Bob to twist and test his songs, letting him discover the soul that lay within. Along the way, Dylan was truly fearless -- he'd goose a tempo to see if it gave a ballad life, he'd let Mike Bloomfield and Robbie Robertson run wild; the fact that he abandoned a song as wonderful as ~She's Your Lover Now,~ possibly because it never quite withstood such stress tests, speaks volumes -- and among the many gifts The Cutting Edge has to offer is that it illuminates these three great records while also illustrating that they were just mere snapshots in time. By breaking down the barriers that separated these three albums, The Cutting Edge shows how for Dylan during this blinding, brilliant peak his music was a living thing, evolving from song to song, take to take, where the quest itself was as transcendent as the final destination.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Tomorrow may be a long time, as Bob Dylan once sang, but listening through The Cutting Edge it’s hard to remember that the brash, aggressive, thin wild mercury sound of the music it captures is half a century old.</p><p>The Cutting Edge, the 12th Bob Dylan release in the Bootleg Series, is comprised of studio outtakes from the three albums—Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde—that Dylan recorded during an unprecedented creative spree in 1965 and 1966. Following on the heels of his first four critically acclaimed solo acoustic albums that featured such enduring songs as “The Times They Are A-Changin’,” “Blowing in the Wind” and “Don’t Think Twice, It’s Alright,” this newest full-band electric music driven by Dylan’s surrealistic amphetamine-charged lyrics left many of his earlier fans scratching their heads—if not completely in the dust. This abrupt stylistic change that was most famously exemplified by the violent reaction to his performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 had far more to do with Dylan’s abandonment of traditional song and lyrical structure than his decision to use electric instruments. The expansive, heartfelt anthems like “Masters of War” and “With God On Our Side” that his earlier fans loved had been replaced by stream-of-consciousness rants like “Subterranean Homesick Blues” and “Visions Of Johanna,” an opus from Blonde on Blonde.</p><p>In the 14 months between March 1965 and May 1966 with the release of three hastily recorded albums, Dylan successfully kicked the shit out of every pop paradigm that existed at the time. By performing material with vocals that were often cutting and abrasive and lyrics that were indirect and suggestive rather than direct and cloying, and composing musical scores that sounded as if they were played by a Salvation Army Band on acid, it often appeared as if Dylan was daring his fans to try and keep up with him.</p><p>The level of intensity that Dylan built during this time could not last indefinitely. The constant recording and seemingly endless touring schedule he had taken on began to take their toll, and when a motorcycle accident sidelined the artist in the summer of 1966, many people came to see this misfortune as an indirect blessing that may have saved his life. In any case, it was a full two years before Dylan returned to the recording studio in 1968 to record John Wesley Harding, a more acoustic album that some saw as a welcome return to form.</p><p>Whatever divine intervention may have been involved in pulling the young Bob Dylan back from the precipice in 1966, and however great and profound his work in the intervening years may have been (I personally think a lot of his best recordings date from the past 15 years), it’s still difficult to assimilate—even from the distance of a half century—just how important and culturally significant his three albums from 1965 and 1966 were. This newest Bootleg Series release goes a long way towards explicating this.</p><p>One of the difficulties in putting together a collection like The Cutting Edge is that for people of a certain generation, many of the songs are very familiar, which undoubtedly made it challenging for the compilers to showcase them in a way that is fresh and engaging. This is especially true with a compilation like this one that presents multiple versions of the same song in consecutive order. With this in mind and realizing that there are varying levels of appetite and obsession when it comes to Bob Dylan’s music, three distinct versions of The Cutting Edge are available. The first, a “best of,” selects the most interesting and fully realized demos and rehearsals to give an abbreviated insight into the creative journey that resulted in Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde On Blonde. On the other side of the spectrum, there’s an 18-disc Collector’s Edition that includes every note (copious warts and all) that Dylan recorded in the studio in 1965 and 1966. It is an amazing document and reference material, and as a chronicle of artistic process, it is absolutely unrivaled. But, for most people’s needs and tastes, and in terms of an enjoyable listening experience, the six-CD Deluxe Edition is probably the best way to go. As with the Collector’s Edition, it features multiple versions of the same songs, studio one-offs, jams, rehearsals and instrumentals. The entire fourth disc is dedicated to chronicling the recording of “Like A Rolling Stone” with a staggering 20 versions of the song presented that trace its development from a 3/4 time solo piano waltz to the six-minute full band single that changed the face of rock music. For the most part, the other five discs in this edition offer representative versions of different songs with just enough depth to satisfy and enlighten all but the most dedicated Dylan completist.</p><p>The chronological flow of songs from the original sessions has been maintained, which establishes a fascinating story arc that is helped along by all of the conversations between Dylan and his producers, Tom Wilson and Bob Johnson, that precede many of the tracks. Dylan’s speaking voice reminds the listener how young he was when he recorded these songs. It is sometimes an uncomfortable, almost voyeuristic experience to listen to him bounce between arrogance and frailty as he complains about wanting to go home or not wanting to sing, often before completely nailing the arrangement of a song. The whining, straining character the tapes present often seems completely at odds with the beauty and intensity of the art he’s created and his obvious commitment to the material. Indeed, the most revealing thing about the songs on The Cutting Edge is that for a guy whose musical skills were often discounted, Dylan was unyielding in his search for innovative sounds and novel arrangements for his lyrics. This can be most clearly heard by listening through the four versions of “Love Minus Zero/No Limit” that open the first disc. Though the changes the song went through were far less drastic than those he subjected “Like A Rolling Stone” to, it is wonderful to hear how the first solo acoustic demo version existed briefly as a duo guitar track before evolving into a restrained, almost elegiac full-band song. The overall effect of presenting the progressions that Dylan’s music went through before its release is that it makes these songs we’ve heard a thousand times on the radio sound engaging and new. The other realization we form when listening is that, despite many arguments to the contrary, Dylan has usually known when he’s “gotten it right.” No matter how much people enjoy listening to, say, the five versions of “Visions of Johanna” recorded with different instrumentation and tempos, the final recording that was chosen to go on Blonde On Blonde was the best one.</p><p>As is true of every one of these archival Bob Dylan releases, the photographs, commentary and essays—this time from Dylan scholars Bill Flanagan and Sal Wilentz—that accompany The Cutting Edge are worthwhile and informative.</p><p>If you’ve never heard Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and/or Blonde On Blonde, try them out first before venturing into The Cutting Edge. If you have heard them so many times that every note and word is already emblazoned into your soul, listen to these outtakes and rehearsals to remind yourself of that brief moment so many years ago when the influence of Hank Williams and Woody Guthrie gave way to the new ideas proposed by Allen Ginsberg and the Beatles. It’ll take you back to that time when Bob Dylan burned the candle at both ends and right down the middle to blur the lines between pop, art and poetry to produce some of the most amazing music ever heard. Fifty years on, and we’re just catching up. The songs on The Cutting Edge are just as brash, bristling and amazing to hear as they were when they were first unleashed half a century ago.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Douglas Heselgrave</strong></p><hr/><p>Bob Dylan was on one of the best creative runs in the history of rock and roll during 1965-1966.</p><p>The three seminal albums he released during those 14 fruitful months, Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, revolutionized the music industry, and fully transitioned his sound from the dusty folk troubadour of the early ‘60s to the amplified, electric bard who helped shape the creative direction of the rest of that decade and beyond.</p><p>The exhaustive new box set, The Cutting Edge 1965-1966: The Bootleg Series Volume 12, provides fans with a comprehensive glimpse into the recording studio with Dylan and producers Tom Wilson and Bob Johnston during that productive time. And while casual fans might not need to hear multiple takes of “On the Road Again” or an entire disc filled with 20 fragmented run-throughs of “Like A Rolling Stone,” the point of this collection is to show that these transformative songs didn’t just appear out of the ether for Bob Dylan. He worked tirelessly to perfect these songs. And it’s a revelation to hear just how he got there, and the compelling missteps and musical frustrations he experienced along the way.</p><p>The distinctive reworkings presented throughout the set are easily discernable from the originals, especially for longtime Dylan fans who have grown accustomed to the traditional album versions over the years. The tinkering that Bob and his rotating cast of musicians did with these indelible songs - in tempo, tone, time-signatures, and arrangements  - proves that these were works in continual progress and motion, and Bob was in the midst of discovering what styles suited the material best. That trait is still true of Dylan as he continues on his Neverending Tour, playing around with cadence, structure and diction from night to night, still giving these timeless classics new life decades later.</p><p>One of the many highlights of this set is the humor and humanity that comes through in these recordings. Sure, the music that resulted from these sessions eventually changed the direction of music, but these versions provide an honest portrayal of the men and musicians who were making it happen. Whether it’s Wilson giving the tracks playful names (“Phantom Engineer Number Cloudy,”  “Alcatraz to the 9th Power”), or Dylan getting frustrated that the drums on an amped-up full band version of “Mr. Tambourine Man” are “driving me mad,” and how he doesn’t feel like playing “It’s Alright Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)” because it’s “such a long song”— the listener is allowed inside those hallowed recording studios to witness Dylan’s mercurial creative process and hear precisely how these celebrated songs of his ultimately came together through both hard work and happenstance.</p><p>Over the years, the pedestal Dylan has been placed on has grown loftier and covered in the superlative garlands of decades of hero worship. But lost within that adulation, you might forget that Dylan was only 23-24 years old during these monumental recording sessions. Like any young musician (even though Dylan wasn’t like any young musician before him, or since), Bob was still in the process of finding his voice and his confidence, despite the fact that he was already considered to be the Voice of His Generation and a significant cultural mouthpiece of the Civil Rights Movement.</p><p>Even with those early accolades - ones that lesser musicians could have forged an entire career out of - Dylan wasn’t interested in staying in one place creatively or repeating himself musically. These recording sessions show Dylan pushing his music in raucous, inspired new directions, while also taking substantial artistic and career risks that belie his young age.</p><p>A motorcycle accident in July of ’66 would immediately slow Dylan’s creative output and lead him to a more reclusive life filled with basement tapes, Nashville skylines, and new mornings. And during that down time, the music world was still trying to catch up to three albums that redefined rock and roll and cemented Bob Dylan’s status as one of the world’s greatest storytellers and musical mysteries.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Erik Thompson - www.lineofbestfit.com</strong></p><hr/><p>Since debuting in 1991, The Bootleg Series has become an essential archival library of previously unreleased Bob Dylan material. Some of the recordings have been widely bootlegged, but most have been unheard until their release as part of the series, and even those that die-hards knew about had never been presented in such pristine sound quality. Everything about the series has been top-notch in terms of quality control and presentation, from track selection, to sound, to packaging. The various releases have covered many periods from throughout Bob Dylan’s storied career, and while some are more vital than others, all are worthwhile. They add an important dimension and scope to understanding Dylan’s work that goes beyond just the officially released albums.</p><p>However, a collection covering Dylan’s golden age, the 14 months that produced three of the most widely influential and celebrated albums in rock history—Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and the double album Blonde on Blonde—had yet to be unveiled. Until now. The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965–1966 is the volume that Dylan fans have been eagerly awaiting, and they won’t be disappointed.</p><p>Fortunately for fans, the series’ producers don’t believe in half-measures. Fans can dive as deeply into these rarified waters as they want. There is a 36-track, two-CD edition that should be the go-to purchase for most fans (a beautifully packaged 3-LP version features the same tracklisting). It contains complete alternate takes and early recordings of many of the period’s most pivotal songs. There’s a six-CD version that includes multiple takes of many of the songs that will appeal the more serious Dylan fans who don’t quite cross the line into obsessive. Of course, if you want the whole enchilada, you can smack down a cool $599.99 for the 18-CD edition collector’s edition (only available at www.BobDylan.com, and limited to 5,000 copies) which covers all of these sessions in their entirety: every note that made it to tape that wasn’t officially released on the main albums themselves. It includes numerous takes, false starts and breakdowns, including studio chatter between Dylan, his band and producers. There are 20 different takes of “Like a Rolling Stone” alone. That creaking sound you hear is the door to the vault opening, and the insides have all been pulled out for examination, cobwebs and all. If there is a Holy Grail for Dylan fans, this is it.</p><p>We’re talking about some of the recordings that define rock ‘n’ roll: cornerstones of the genre. 1965 is the year that Bob Dylan transitioned from a folk singer to a rock ‘n’ roller. He plugged in with the opening track and iconic single from Bringing It All Back Home, “Subterranean Homesick Blues”, and, to paraphrase D.A. Pennebaker, didn’t look back. It was the first taste of an amazing creative run that produced many of Dylan’s most beloved songs and catapulted him to the iconic status that he’s never relinquished.</p><p>Obviously it will take even the most dedicated Dylanologists a long time to sort through the riches of the 18-disc version, so this review will focus on the two-CD edition. It will be enough for all but the heartiest Dylan fans, and it’s a wonder in itself. Most of the tracks are complete takes, and they sound amazing. It’s like an alternate “Best Of” from Dylan’s most important period. We get to peer through the lens of history from a slightly different angle, 50 years after these recordings took place. It’s a wonderful alternate reality in which all of these familiar songs are presented in various stages of completion, sometimes with startlingly different arrangements and variations in the lyrics.</p><p>An alternate take “Love Minus Zero/No Limit” starts the collection, and it’s a gem. It’s missing the electric guitar counter-melody from the official release, which allows more focus on a terrific vocal by Dylan. The stunning piano demo of “I’ll Keep it With Mine” is the same one that appears on the 1985 box set Biograph, but it’s a welcome inclusion nonetheless as it’s one of Dylan’s greatest lesser-known tracks. Judy Collins released a wonderfully sprightly pop take on it in 1965, and two years later Nico recorded an austere cover for her Chelsea Girl album that more closely resembles Dylan’s recording. The only other previously-released track on the two-CD edition is Dylan’s demo of “Farewell, Angelina”, a song made famous by Joan Baez (Dylan’s version had previously appeared on the first Bootleg Series release in 1991).</p><p>An early highlight is an alternate take of “Subterranean Homesick Blues”.  A solo acoustic recording of “She Belongs to Me” is the song freshly baked, take one. Dylan would give it a swinging full band arrangement on Bringing It All Back Home but has played it live solo acoustically over the years (as on The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Live 1966 - The “Royal Albert Hall” Concert) but here we get to experience the song fresh from Dylan’s pen, just as he was trying it out for the first time in the studio.</p><p>There are two version of “Like a Rolling Stone” included on the two-CD edition. First is Take five, in which Dylan and his band gamely try out a waltz version of the song that sputters out before reaching the two-minute mark. Thankfully Dylan didn’t pursue this direction, but it’s fascinating to hear nonetheless. Take 11 is complete, and it’s obvious that Dylan and his band are finally getting the song where it needs to be. Although it lacks the ferocity of the final recording used for the single, it’s getting closer.</p><p>At every turn, there’s a revelation—for instance, the two-minute piano demo of “Desolation Row”. Hearing this timeless epic in its early, embryonic form cuts through all the mythology and gives the listener access to Dylan’s creative process. A mellowish recording of “Positively 4th Street”, without the bright organ riffs of the single version, presents an interesting contrast, given the bite of the lyrics the sharpness of the final recording. One of the absolute highlights is take four of “Just Like a Woman”, in which the song is arranged as an uptempo countrified rock and roll shuffle. Thankfully Dylan veered far away from this direction in the end, but hearing it in this form is interesting to say the least. The version of “Just Like Tom Thumb’s Blues” presented is the shambolic take three, which finds Dylan and the band still trying to find the feel of the song. It’s relaxed and languid, and sounds like it should be rolling under a haze of marijuana smoke.</p><p>Much more focused is a fantastic recording of the Blonde on Blonde classic “One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)”, with only bits of harmonica instead of the fat riffs that wheeze through the final product, and with a different melodic take on the chorus. Take three of “Highway 61 Revisited” is a ferocious performance with Dylan fully committed in his vocals—it’s worthy of having been released, and the absence of the shrill siren whistle on the final take is a bonus. The furiously hard-rocking “Visions of Johanna” with a much fuller band arrangement than the haunting, skeletal final recording is fantastic, a totally different vibe but one that works well. We get take six of “She’s Your Lover Now”, a song that frustrated Dylan as he tried without success to get it down. He’d eventually abandon it. The first edition of the Bootleg Series includes take 19, which is nearly a full version. The recording here is stilted and awkward—Dylan’s frustration with his inability to translate what he is hearing in his head for the song is so obvious it’s palpable. It breaks down before Dylan can finish it.</p><p>The recording of “Tombstone Blues” included has a markedly different vibe than what we’re used to hearing, especially with the vocals. The final version is so blistering and jagged, it’s interesting to hear the Dylan and his band working their way up to it. Not quite there yet, but they’re figuring things out. Take 13 of “Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again” is a slower, more relaxed reading of the song with an excellent vocal, but the delicate descending acoustic guitar and bass breakdown between verses breaks up the song awkwardly, sapping it of its drive and momentum. Again, it’s Dylan and his band noodling through it, finding their way to what ends up on the final album. We get the first take of “Absolutely Sweet Marie”, and it’s not too far off from the final version. Take four of “I Want You” is similarly close to the final recording.</p><p>Thus the collection goes: classic song after classic song, presented in a different state of completion and sometimes with a wholly different vision. The fact that these versions do not approach the greatness of the final recordings is exactly the point. These are works in progress. It’s a guided tour through the creative process that led to these landmark albums, with an excellent booklet containing essays, liner notes, details on the recordings, and beautiful photographs from the sessions.</p><p>Dylan’s archival releases are among the best in the industry, and the sound clarity is startlingly good. If any era defines what makes Bob Dylan the greatest songwriter in rock and roll history, it’s the three albums covered by these sessions. It’s an essential, thrilling collection that is an absolute must-have for Dylan fans. And if you’re not a Dylan fan, you should buy it anyway and hopefully become one. The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965–1966 is more than just music—it’s cultural history of colossal significance. This collection is a resource that fans and students of Dylan’s work will reference again and again as the years and decades pass and these classic albums are introduced to new generations of music fans.  </p><p>&mdash;<strong>Chris Gerard - www.popmatters.com</strong></p>"

Shepherded by the Band's Robbie Robertson, that 1975 double-vinyl inserted Band recordings where they didn't belong, suggesting the group were equal partners when it was really Dylan's show. The Basement Tapes: Raw rights this wrong, stripping away the excess overdubs and excising the ten Band songs -- a process which includes handing some of the tunes back over to Bob, including a wildly careening version of ~Don't Ya Tell Henry~ -- and then adding in all the major Dylan originals missing from the 1975 LP (~I'm Not There,~ ~Santa-Fe,~ ~Minstrel Boy,~ ~Quinn the Eskimo,~ ~Get Your Rocks Off,~ ~Sign on the Cross~) and then adding hints of the covers and general madness that can be found in the complete haul. Naturally, some gems are available only in the big box, including a bunch of folk tunes, a rangy ~Big River~ and ~Kickin' My Dog Around,~ plus the goofs ~See You Later Allen Ginsberg~ and ~All American Boy,~ but that's the kind of stuff that seems better in context, when it's surrounded by the heavyweight songs showcased here. On their own on this superb two-disc set, those songs amount to a version of the Basement Tapes that not only represents what happened at Big Pink more accurately, but is a thrilling, endlessly captivating listen in its own right.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>In 1969, an underground Bob Dylan album featuring unreleased material found its way into the world; 40 years later, the effects of this early leak are still playing out.</p><p>If you were driving around certain parts of southern California in the summer of 1968, you may have heard Bob Dylan's version of ~This Wheel's on Fire~ on the radio. KNAC in Long Beach, KPPC and KMET in L.A., KCSB in Santa Barbara, and KRLA in Pasadena were playing it in heavy rotation. A different version of the song was included on side B of Music from Big Pink, the debut album from the Band, which was released that July. At the time, the Band were mostly known for their Dylan affiliation-- if they were known at all. Dylan, of course, was the most highly regarded solo musician since Elvis, though he'd been out of the public spotlight for two years after a motorcycle accident. For many Dylanites, ~Wheel's~ suggested a return to the looser, harder-rocking Blonde on Blonde after the more reserved folk record John Wesley Harding, which was issued the prior December. It's likely that many hearing the song were under the impression that it was an advance single from a forthcoming Dylan LP. But why was the quality so terrible?</p><p>The small readership of upstart San Francisco rock magazine Rolling Stone were more clued in. Its publisher Jann Wenner had written a June cover story advocating not just for the official release of ~This Wheel's On Fire~, but 12 other songs that Dylan had recently recorded in a basement in upstate New York. In a lead feature titled ~Dylan's Basement Tape Should Be Released~, Wenner reported-- in a manner predicting modern music journalists filing copy after a leak-avoiding listening party-- ~Bob Dylan… made a rough but very listenable tape with thirteen songs… There is enough material-- most all of it very good-- to make an entirely new Bob Dylan record, a record with a distinct style of its own.~ Turned out that Dylan and the Band had set up shop to make a demo tape of new songs for other artists to record, and then circulated it privately. It worked: A cover version of ~Wheel's~ by English pop singer Julie Driscoll reached No. 5 in the UK that summer, Manfred Mann's take on ~The Mighty Quinn~ peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard chart, Peter, Paul & Mary hit the Top 40 with ~Too Much of Nothing~, and the Byrds' ~You Ain't Goin' Nowhere~, a centerpiece of Sweetheart of the Rodeo, hit FM radio that April. Dylan's music was everywhere, but Dylan himself remained secluded.</p><blockquote>While history records Great White Wonder as rock's firstwidely circulated bootleg, underground releases ofits ilk are like the cool uncle of the digital leak.</blockquote><p>Was he retiring to start a lucrative career as a one-man Brill Building? Were these new tunes what someone would later call ~deserter's songs,~ a retreat from a political climate threatening to boil over? Wenner's column-length advocacy, along with the radio play of ~Wheel's~ and other songs from that demo tape, were working to push against this possibility, creating demand for what was called The Basement Tape to be released on its own. ~Dylan brings that instinctual feel for rock and roll to his voice for the first time,~ Wenner claimed. ~If this were ever to be released, it would be a classic.~ Columbia would release these songs, and they would be very highly regarded and commercially successful... seven years later, in 1975.</p><p>Instead, in June of 1970, fans got the double-album Self Portrait, which, although reappraised in subsequent years, did not fare well initially. In his Rolling Stone review, Greil Marcus claimed, ~Self-Portrait, though it's a good imitation bootleg, isn't nearly the music that Great White Wonder is.~ If you were a regular Rolling Stone reader, you were familiar with Great White Wonder--they'd covered it well. You may have bought a copy if you lived in L.A., or near an independent record store willing to stock it. While it's not part of Dylan's official catalog, Wonder did become a classic in its own right, though not as Wenner intended it to be. It was a demand-driven solution to The Basement Tape's scarcity. Great White Wonder was the first album leak.</p><p>Cheaply pressed as a double album in an initial run of 1 to 2,000 copies by two anonymous L.A. music industry insiders who went by Dub and Ken, Great White Wonder started appearing in record stores in summer 1969, the title gleaned from its plain white jacket, decorated only with a titular stamp. There were 23 tracks on Wonder, subscribing to a sequencing logic that is hard to pin down. Ten cuts were drawn from the ~Minnesota Tapes~, a collection of American standards Dylan recorded in May and December 1961. ~Only a Hobo~ and ~Bob Dylan's New Orleans Rag~ came from 1963 Columbia demos, and ~Sitting on a Barbed Wire Fence~ and ~If You Gotta Go, Go Now~ were great-sounding studio outtakes from the Highway 61 sessions. A version of ~The Death of Emmitt Till~ was pulled from a session with the folk magazine Broadside, and ~Living the Blues~ was recorded off of the television, from Dylan's May 1969 appearance on ~The Johnny Cash Show~. Wonder was a grab-bag retrospective of Dylan's career to that point, serving as something of a corrective to his absence and a harbinger of a career that wouldn't continue along the path it had taken for the first half of the decade.</p><blockquote>The low grade of the recordings on Great White Wonderonly added to their aura, and to the sense that fans werelistening in on a secret meeting between collaborators.</blockquote><p>Just those 16 tracks alone wouldn't have amounted to much, however. Alternate versions of already existing songs are a nice bit of collectible ephemera for die hards, but they're nothing compared to the voyeuristic and legally dubious revelation of new songs. Wonder had seven of them; more than half of the Basement Tape demos recorded just before Dylan left to make John Wesley Harding in Nashville. Along with ~Wheel's~, ~Quinn~, ~Nothing~, and ~Nowhere~, there was ~Open the Door, Homer~, as well as ~Tears of Rage~ and ~I Shall Be Released~, which had respectively opened and closed Big Pink.</p><p>In terms of recording quality, these songs sounded absolutely horrible. They were only intended as demos, and odds are the versions that were circulating had been dubbed numerous times, resulting in a significant loss of fidelity. But the low grade of the recordings-- particularly in comparison to the other, better-recorded songs on Wonder-- only added to their aura, and to the sense that fans were listening in on a secret meeting between collaborators. ~We went in with a sense of humor… It was all a goof,~ the Band's Robbie Robertson later told Greil Marcus. ~We were playing with absolute freedom; we weren't doing anything we thought anybody else would ever hear, as long as we lived. But what started in that basement, what came out of it… came out of this little conspiracy, of us amusing ourselves.~ This was the nature of a leak in 1969-- a rare glimpse into the backstage life of a superstar. A conspiracy built from a conspiracy.</p><p>In 1969, Bob Dylan was one of three artists famous enough to create the kind of demand required to trigger a leak of unreleased studio recordings (the Beatles and the Rolling Stones would soon both fall prey to now-legendary leaks). While history records Wonder as rock's first widely circulated bootleg, underground releases of Wonder's ilk are like the cool uncle of the digital leak. By definition, they're indistinguishable: recordings (live or studio-made) which are not released on the artist's label but instead sold or traded in ancillary or underground markets (Dub and Ken had a ~label~ they called TMQ, or ~Trademark of Quality~). Fans had been trading magnetic tapes of already-released albums for years by this point, but Wonder was different: It was the first time that unheard recordings of a superstar's new compositions had leaked to the public, and were being sold. It's easy to take such a thing for granted today, when leaks circulate freely online, but Wonder represented the earliest moment when advancing technologies combined with popular demand and illicit entrepreneurship to create cracks in the record industry's otherwise firm facade.</p><p>Despite the fact that many copies of Wonder were pressed at professional operations, the quality was extremely poor: Oftentimes, the top layer of vinyl would literally scrape off after about 20 plays.</p><p>In 2012, a simple Google search can turn up Wonder in full via BitTorrent, with few worries about private investigators tracking your movements. In 1969, however, the stakes were significantly higher, and much more money was being put into Wonder's production-- and exchanged for access to it. Southern California record stores saw it flying off the shelves-- or, more accurately, out from under the counter. Dub and Ken were wholesaling the album just like any other, reported Jerry Hopkins for Rolling Stone in September 1969, charging $4.50 each and lowering the price to $4.25 after the first 50. A typical markup was $2, though some stores were charging much more. ~Those shops carrying the LP seem happy,~ Hopkins noted, ~with many reporting the album's arrival has had the same effect on business as a new Beatles or Stones LP might have.~ By October, Wonder had spread to New York, and the Times reported that ~at a small record stop near Columbia University, the proprietor just winked when asked where he had gotten the albums.~</p><p>Dubs of dubs of dubs of Wonder, some with different track orders and most with different cover art, were proliferating through the underground. This is how Norton Beckman and Ben Goldman, two record store owners from the Fairfax district of Los Angeles, acquired their copies. They took an early version of the tape to an audio engineer in downtown L.A., who made acetates from it, which were then used to make ~stampers~-- the master versions that were pressed to be sold. These were processed in the off hours of a record processing company-- ~one of the many in the city who ask no questions,~ Rolling Stone noted, then pressed and inserted into plain white sleeves at S&R Record Manufacturers in Gardena. Despite the fact that many copies of Wonder were pressed at professional operations, the quality was extremely poor: Oftentimes, the top layer of vinyl would literally scrape off after about 20 plays.</p><p>Beckman and Goldman became the target of Columbia's investigation into Wonder bootlegging. They were given up to Columbia's A&R department by ~an anonymous phone call from a woman who said she knew who the bootleggers were,~ Rolling Stone claimed. The woman was an acquaintance of the bootleggers, and was reporting them because the two ~had been bad-mouthing some friends of hers.~ Columbia was quick to make a public show of finding and stopping the Wonder bootlegs, though they had already proliferated far out of their legal control. ~We consider the release of this record an abuse of the integrity of a great artist,~ Columbia said in a 1969 press release. ~They are at one time defaming the artist and defrauding his admirers.~ But to many fans, Wonder was the opposite of fraud; particularly with countercultural vibes in the air, Columbia was the bad guy.</p><p>Though they had to make a public stance against bootlegging, Dylan's label was fully aware that their legal options were significantly limited. Columbia sent private detectives to uncover record stores selling Wonder and filed cease and desist orders against transgressors, but that was about the limit of their capabilities. They had no idea who Dub and Ken were, let alone where they were, so they couldn't serve the two pirates with a legal order. As Clinton Heylin observed in his great 1995 book Bootleg: The Secret History of the Other Recording Industry, Wonder's tracklisting might have seemed random, but Dub and Ken weren't dumb-- they made sure to craft it to fit in a liminal legal zone. Columbia couldn't verify if the ~Minnesota Tape~ songs were recorded after Dylan signed with them (and he was a minor when he signed his contract with the label, to boot). The traditional songs were mostly in the public domain. Furthermore, the Basement Tape material wasn't recorded in a Columbia studio, the Band weren't under contract, and Dylan was himself between contracts with the label. (For some inexplicable reason, Columbia failed to do anything about the Highway 61 sessions included on the album.) And Dub and Ken were savvy enough not to include Dylan's name or likeness anywhere on the packaging, so as to avoid a lawsuit over those aspects of his identity.</p><p>In the wake of Wonder, bootlegging flourished, though quality was never guaranteed. Devoted rock fans near in-the-know stores could rely on buying unauthorized recordings cobbled together from leaked studio tapes, audience recordings of live performances, and televised appearances from Dylan, the Rolling Stones, and the Beatles. ~In Minnesota, Come Back is being sold illegally,~ reported Rolling Stone in 1970. ~This is a poor quality copy of the Beatles' Let It Be album, due to be released God only knows when… Quality is… poor, as if the tape was recorded by a mike off a speaker, instead of directly dubbed.~</p><p>Other bootlegs were of a much higher quality, and the practice was turning into a bonafide industry. Greil Marcus reviewed three bootlegs in a 1970 issue of the magazine: the Wonder followup Stealin', the Plastic Ono Band's Live Peace in Toronto, and the tremendous live Stones LP Live'r Than You'll Ever Be (recorded and released by Dub himself). Marcus took into account the vagaries of quality as well as the content. ~Consider them new records by the Beatles, the Stones, and Dylan,~ Marcus wrote. ~They aren't going to be around for very long, and simply on the basis of their musical quality, they should be bought right now. None of these albums is a mere 'collectors item,' like the Great White Wonder stuff-- all of them are listenable and exciting on their own terms.~</p><p>In early 1970, the idea of flooding the market with consistent streams of new material from huge artists wasn't part of record labels' plans, though perhaps it should have been. B-side collections and live albums were expensive to produce and publicize, and their market was still very limited, at least in the labels' imaginations. It must have been thrilling to hear what Marcus claimed was ~the ultimate Rolling Stones album,~ a high quality version of a show at the Oakland Coliseum in 1969 (which Marcus suspected was done from the stage by a sound technician, but which Dub confessed was accomplished merely by ~the Sennheiser shotgun pointed at the PA system~). ~Whatever we take out of their pockets, we're doing as much for them in terms of publicity and interest in their music,~ one bootlegger told Rolling Stone, in language that echoes down to 21st century downloading defenses. He continued, asserting that the rules of market competition still apply in the underground. ~The word 'moral' doesn't apply. It's a matter of get what you can, and when someone else pops up copying our stuff, we do what we can to get more product at less cost. Maybe that's what the big record companies should do-- compete with us. They weren't going to release this material anyway, were they?~</p><p>What happens with mp3 leaks illuminates a very basic economic fact: Official markets will always lead to unsanctioned ones that feed off of the legit products-- and often operate much more efficiently.</p><p>While labels tried everything they could (at least publicly) to stamp out bootlegging, the artists themselves were much more amenable to their existence. The Live'r boot was so good, in fact, that after the Stones' road manager heard a copy at KSAN in San Fransisco, he bought a copy for himself and five more-- one for each band member. When the entirety of the Basement Tapes was finally released in 1975, Dylan himself was publicly surprised at the reception and strong commercial showing: ~I thought everybody already had them.~ It makes sense that artists then and now would be more tolerant of leaks than their labels. While they need only concern themselves with making music to be discovered and heard by as many people as they wish, the labels have to foot the bill for production, distribution, and promotion.</p><p>On one basic level, what happened in 1969 with Wonder-- and what happens every day with mp3 leaks-- illuminates a very basic economic fact: Official markets will always lead to unsanctioned ones that feed off of the legit products-- and often operate much more efficiently. Consumer desire has never automatically limited itself to strictly legal operations, particularly when fans can convince themselves (often rightly) that they're doing no harm to the artists. In his recent book Pop Song Piracy, Barry Kernfeld pointed out that for as long as companies have been selling musical objects-- from sheet music to albums, cassettes, compact discs, and mp3s-- they have been faced with threats to their monopoly over distribution due to unauthorized duplication and circulation. Playing devil's advocate, since consumers are always encouraged to get the most product for the least amount of money and time, why should music fans make moral distinctions that capitalism itself doesn't?</p><p>Thanks to the unpredictable interplay of record labels, artists, laws, technologies, and music journalism, bootlegging and leaks can upend the the power structure when it comes to rolling out new releases-- but only the scope, not the idea, has changed in the last 40-plus years. In the late 60s, FM was still the Wild West compared to today's radio landscape, and rock journalism was in its infancy. Music copyright laws were full of loopholes, and duplication technologies were developing at an unprecedented pace. It was a moment when renowned critics would review hot new bootlegs, and Rolling Stone's publisher could openly lobby Columbia to release a particular Bob Dylan album. When record store owners could feel relatively safe moving illicitly pressed LPs from behind the counter, and radio jocks would play unofficial tracks in regular rotation. Labels filed lawsuits against bootleggers in vain, resenting a significant loss of control over their own operations, but often reaped their promotional benefits nonetheless.</p><p>And now: Bloggers and status updaters rewrote the guidebook for music journalism and promotion, leaving them in an unsettled state akin to the late 60s and early 70s (though now with much more gratis labor). Leaks are mass duplicated on the same machines that also serve as jukeboxes and publishing outlets, driving money not to labels or record stores or shady pressing plants but international file-locker sites like Mediafire, corporately owned ISPs, and proprietors of cloud servers. Fans take to Twitter and message boards begging for a leak of whatever new album has just been announced. And when these records are inevitably set free, they're often cloaked in the modern equivalent of plain white wrappers with a generic stamp-- .zip or .rar files renamed to travel online, unnoticed by label employees and Google-scouring security firms. Great White Wonder may be a modern impossibility in its original incarnation, but 40 years later, in a vastly de-industrialized music climate, its ongoing legacy suggests less a digital revolution than the mundane fact that, in the face of innovation, some old habits die hard.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Eric Harvey - Pitchfork</strong></p>"

				"review": "<P>The official release of The Basement Tapes -- which were first heard on a 1968 bootleg called The Great White Wonder -- plays with history somewhat, as Robbie Robertson overemphasizes the Band's status in the sessions, making them out to be equally active to Dylan, adding in demos not cut at the sessions and overdubbing their recordings to flesh them out. As many bootlegs (most notably the complete five-disc series) reveal, this isn't entirely true and that the Band were nowhere near as active as Dylan, but that ultimately is a bit like nitpicking, since the music here (including the Band's) is astonishingly good. The party line on The Basement Tapes is that it is Americana, as Dylan and the Band pick up the weirdness inherent in old folk, country, and blues tunes, but it transcends mere historical arcana by being lively, humorous, full-bodied performances. Dylan never sounded as loose, nor was he ever as funny as he is here, and this positively revels in its weird, wild character. For all the apparent antecedents -- and the allusions are sly and obvious in equal measures -- this is truly Dylan's show, as he majestically evokes old myths and creates new ones, resulting in a crazy quilt of blues, humor, folk, tall tales, inside jokes, and rock. The Band pretty much pick up where Dylan left off, even singing a couple of his tunes, but they play it a little straight, on both their rockers and ballads. Not a bad thing at all, since this actually winds up providing context for the wild, mercurial brilliance of Dylan's work -- and, taken together, the results (especially in this judiciously compiled form; expert song selection, even if there's a bit too much Band) rank among the greatest American music ever made.</P><P>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B></P><HR><BR><STRONG>Wikipedia<BR></STRONG><BR><SPAN class=mw-headline><STRONG>The Story of the Basement Tapes</STRONG></SPAN> <P>In the mid-1960s, Bob Dylan was at the peak of his creativity, having officially broken into the mainstream with his popular and acclaimed albums <I><A title=~Highway 61 Revisited~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_61_Revisited~>Highway 61 Revisited</A></I> and <I><A title=~Blonde on Blonde~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blonde_on_Blonde~>Blonde on Blonde</A></I>. In the latter half of 1965, during the interim between those two albums, Dylan began touring with The Hawks (later known as <A title=~The Band~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band~>The Band</A>). Their live collaboration would continue into the first half of 1966, culminating in a legendary 'world' tour documented in <I><A title='The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The ~Royal Albert Hall~ Concert' href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._4:_Bob_Dylan_Live_1966%2C_The_%22Royal_Albert_Hall%22_Concert~>The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The ~Royal Albert Hall~ Concert</A></I>.</P><P>According to Hawks/Band guitarist <A title=~Robbie Robertson~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Robertson~>Robbie Robertson</A>, ~When I first met [Dylan] [in 1965], I played him this ballad from <A title=~The Impressions (American band)~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impressions_%28American_band%29~>The Impressions</A>' <I>Keep On Pushing</I> album, 'I've Been Trying,' written by <A title=~Curtis Mayfield~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Mayfield~>Curtis Mayfield</A>. I said: 'They're not saying anything much and this is killing me, and you're rambling on for an hour and you're losing me; I mean, I think you're losing the spirit.'~ Whether or not Robertson's comments had any real influence on Dylan's decision to change his musical direction, within a couple of years Dylan would be writing quite different styles of songs.</P><P>On July 29th that year, Dylan suffered a mild concussion and cracked vertebrae when he crashed his Triumph 650 Bonneville motorcycle near <A title=~Woodstock, New York~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock%2C_New_York~>Woodstock, New York</A>. He was taken to a local hospital where he phoned the members of the Hawks, informing them of his injuries. Dylan and the Hawks were scheduled to perform at several concerts later in the year, but with Dylan's current condition, those concerts had to be cancelled.</P><P>A little more than a week later, Dylan was back in Woodstock, wearing a neck brace and recuperating at a local doctor's house. While he was recovering, Dylan reviewed a preliminary cut of <A title=~D. A. Pennebaker~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._A._Pennebaker~>D. A. Pennebaker</A>'s documentary of the 1966 'world' tour. ~They had made another <I><A title=~Dont Look Back~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dont_Look_Back~>Dont Look Back</A></I>, only this time it was for television,~ recalled Dylan in 1978. ~I had nothing better to do than to see the film. All of it, including unused footage. And it was obvious from looking at the film that it was garbage. It was miles and miles of garbage.~ Dissatisfied with Pennebaker's results, Dylan re-edited the footage into a surrealistic film, titled <I><A title=~Eat the Document~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_the_Document~>Eat the Document</A></I>. (Howard Alk, who shot much of the footage, and Robbie Robertson also accepted Dylan's invitation to help him edit the film.)</P><P>As biographer Clinton Heylin writes, ~in the latter months of 1966 Dylan was certainly re-evaluating where he had come to at the age of twenty-five, and reviewing the raw film footage [of <I>Eat the Document</I>] was only part of that process.~</P><P>Dylan later recalled, ~The turning point was back in Woodstock. A little after the accident. Sitting around one night under a full moon, I looked out into the bleak woods and I said, 'Something's gotta change.'~</P><P>According to the late <A title=~Rick Danko~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Danko~>Rick Danko</A>, the Hawks joined Robbie Robertson at their house in West Saugerties in February of 1967. Nicknamed ~Big Pink,~ the house originally belonged to ~Rick Danko, <A title=~Richard Manuel~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Manuel~>Richard Manuel</A> and <A title=~Garth Hudson~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Hudson~>Garth Hudson</A>,~ according to Robertson. ~I think Levon eventually moved in there, too. I didn't live there, but the whole idea was that we had been living in New York City, and we ended up moving upstate really to get a clubhouse, a place where we could woodshed. It was a real clubhouse, and we were just like a street gang — only we played music instead of going out fighting. We would get together every day at the clubhouse, just like the Bowery Boys. And as soon as Bob got well from his motorcycle accident, he started coming up every day.~</P><P>The date is uncertain, but sometime between March and June, Dylan and the Hawks began a series of informal recording sessions. Originally taking place at Dylan's house, ~in the equally color-conscious Red Room~ (according to Heylin), these informal sessions eventually moved to the basement of Big Pink.</P><P>~We used to get together everyday at one o' clock in the basement of Big Pink, and it was just a routine. We would get there and to keep [every] one of us from going crazy, we would play music every day ... There was no particular reason for it. We weren't making a record. We were just fooling around. The purpose was whatever comes into anybody's mind, we'll put it down on this little tape recorder.~ That tape recorder was actually an old Uher that was used on their legendary 'world' tour in 1966. Equipped with a couple of Altec PA tube mixers and allowing up to three microphones to be input per channel, with four or five studio-quality Neumann microphones, the machine was operated by the Hawks' Garth Hudson during the recording sessions. Dylan would later say in 1969, ~that's really the way to do a recording — in a peaceful, relaxed setting, in somebody's basement, with the windows open and a dog lying on the floor.~</P><P>For the first couple of months, they were just ~killing time,~ according to Robertson. Apparently, much of the early months was spent on covers. ~With the covers Bob was educating us a little,~ recalls Roberston. ~The whole folkie thing was still very questionable to us — it wasn't the train we came in on ... He'd come up with something like '[The Banks of the] Royal Canal,' and you'd say, 'This is so beautiful! The expression!' ... he remembered too much, remembered too many songs too well. He'd come over to Big Pink, or wherever we were, and pull out some old song — and he'd prepped for this. He'd practiced this, and then come out here, to show us.~ Circulating tapes from these sessions reveal a large, diverse number of popular songs, including compositions written or made popular by <A title=~Johnny Cash~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash~>Johnny Cash</A>, <A title=~The Stanley Brothers~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stanley_Brothers~>The Stanley Brothers</A>, <A title=~Ian Tyson~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Tyson~>Ian Tyson</A>, <A title=~John Lee Hooker~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lee_Hooker~>John Lee Hooker</A>, <A title=~Hank Williams~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Williams~>Hank Williams</A> and <A title=~Eric Von Schmidt~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Von_Schmidt~>Eric Von Schmidt</A> as well as ~sea shanties ... country tearjerkers, from pure gospel to morality tales ... material from the English and Irish dales, the <A title=~Appalachian Mountains~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains~>Appalachian Mountains</A>, the <A title=~Mississippi Delta~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Delta~>Mississippi Delta</A>, <A title=Nashville href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville~>Nashville</A>'s Music Row, and even <A title=~Tin Pan Alley~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_Pan_Alley~>Tin Pan Alley</A>,~ according to Heylin.</P><P>Dylan was soon writing and recording new compositions at these informal sessions. ~We were doing seven, eight, ten, sometimes fifteen songs a day,~ recalls Hudson. ~Some were old ballads and traditional songs ... but others Bob would make up as he went along ... We'd play the melody, he'd sing a few words he'd written, and then make up some more, or else just mouth sounds or even syllables as he went along. It's a pretty good way to write songs.~</P><P>Two of the first songs Dylan recorded was ~Tiny Montgomery~ and ~Sign on the Cross~; the former ~rediscovered his flair for characters out of left field,~ wrote Heylin, while the latter ~captures the deathless fatalism of gospel and country Dylan was after in much of his later born-again albums,~ according to <A title=NPR href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR~>NPR</A>'s Tim Riley.</P><P>In a matter of months, Dylan would record at least thirty new compositions with the Hawks, including some of the most celebrated songs of his career: ~I Shall Be Released~, ~This Wheel's On Fire~, ~<A title=~Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_the_Eskimo_%28The_Mighty_Quinn%29~>Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)</A>~, ~Million Dollar Bash~, ~Tears Of Rage~, ~You Ain't Going Nowhere~, ~Going To Acapulco~, ~I'm Not There (1956)~, ~All You Have To Do Is Dream~, ~Apple Suckling Tree~, etc. At least two songs were co-written with members of the Hawks: ~Tears Of Rage~ with Richard Manuel and ~This Wheel's On Fire~ with Rick Danko. ~He came down to the basement with a piece of typewritten paper ... and he just said, 'Have you got any music for this?',~ recalled Manuel. ~I had a couple of musical movements that fit ... so I just elaborated a bit, because I wasn't sure what the lyrics meant. I couldn't run upstairs and say, 'What's this mean, Bob: 'Now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse'?'~</P><P>In May of 1967, Dylan gave his first interview in roughly a year. He told Michael Iachetta that ~What I've been doing mostly is seeing only a few close friends, reading a little 'bout the outside world, poring over books by people you never heard of, thinking about where I'm going, and why am I running, and am I mixed up too much, and what am I knowing, and what am I giving and what am I taking ... Songs are in my head like they always are. And they're not going to get written down until some things are evened up. Not until some people come forth and make up for some of the things that happened.~</P><P>According to Heylin, that someone expected to atone 'for some of the things that happened' was Dylan's manager, <A title=~Albert Grossman~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Grossman~>Albert Grossman</A>. Within weeks of the interview, Dylan recorded a <A title=~Bobby Bare~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Bare~>Bobby Bare</A> song that dated back to 1959. Titled ~All-American Boy~, it was originally a thinly veiled critique of <A title=~Elvis Presley~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley~>Elvis Presley</A>'s notorious manager, Colonel Tom Parker, but Dylan rewrote some of the verses, adding some personal references regarding his relationship with Grossman.</P><P>Though Dylan still owed Columbia one more album, he did not want to fulfill that obligation with the songs written and recorded at Big Pink. In fact, Dylan's original intentions for those songs remain unclear. At the end of August, ten of them were dubbed down from their original stereo recordings to mono and copyrighted by Dwarf Music; in January of 1968, Dylan copyrighted another batch of songs including ~Tears of Rage~, ~<A title=~Quinn The Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_The_Eskimo_%28The_Mighty_Quinn%29~>Quinn The Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)</A>,~ ~Nothing Was Delivered~, and ~Open the Door Homer.~ Jointly formed by Dylan and Grossman, Dwarf Music was established in 1965 in order to copyright demos intended for other artists. In an interview taken in 1978, Dylan admitted that the songs written and recorded at Big Pink ~were written vaguely for other people ... I don't remember anybody specifically those songs were ever written for ... At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads.~</P><P><A title=~Peter, Paul and Mary~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter%2C_Paul_and_Mary~>Peter, Paul and Mary</A> were the first to chart with a Big Pink composition when they issued their single of ~Too Much of Nothing~ in November of 1967. Soon after, <A title=~Manfred Mann~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Mann~>Manfred Mann</A> topped the charts with ~<A title=~Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_the_Eskimo_%28The_Mighty_Quinn%29~>Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)</A>.~ When <A title=~The Byrds~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Byrds~>The Byrds</A> released their groundbreaking, country-rock album <I><A title=~Sweetheart of the Rodeo~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetheart_of_the_Rodeo~>Sweetheart of the Rodeo</A></I> in 1968, they opened and closed it with ~You Ain't Goin' Nowhere~ and ~Nothing Was Delivered~. In the UK, ~This Wheel's on Fire~ made the top 5 for <A title=~Julie Driscoll~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Driscoll~>Julie Driscoll</A> and the <A title=~Brian Auger~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Auger~>Brian Auger</A> Trinity; the song was also covered by <A title=~The Byrds~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Byrds~>The Byrds</A> for their second album of 1968, <I><A title=~Dr. Byrds &amp; Mr. Hyde~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Byrds_%26_Mr._Hyde~>Dr. Byrds &amp; Mr. Hyde</A></I>, while the Hawks — reunited with Levon Helm and rechristened <A title=~The Band~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band~>The Band</A> — recorded their own version on their celebrated debut, <I><A title=~Music from Big Pink~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_from_Big_Pink~>Music from Big Pink</A></I>, an album that also featured ~I Shall Be Released~ and ~Tears of Rage.~ <A title=~Fairport Convention~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairport_Convention~>Fairport Convention</A> would also record ~Million Dollar Bash~ on their celebrated third album, <I><A title=Unhalfbricking href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unhalfbricking~>Unhalfbricking</A></I>.</P><P>Eventually, rumors of Dylan and The Band's enormous stash of unreleased recordings began to circulate. <I><A title=~Rolling Stone Magazine~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone_Magazine~>Rolling Stone Magazine</A></I> even ran a cover story in June of 1968, claiming that ~there is enough material ... to make an entirely new Bob Dylan record, a record with a distinct style of its own ... These tapes could easily be remastered and made into a record. The concept of a cohesive record is already present.~</P><P>The fourteen songs copyrighted by Dwarf Music brought those particular songs into private circulation, as demo acetates were soon cut for those songs. With no planned release in sight, these demo acetates became the source material for a number of bootlegs, the first of which was titled <I>Great White Wonder</I>. Bootlegs had existed for many years, mostly among other forms of music, but with <I>Great White Wonder</I>, rock music had its first commercially (albeit illegally) available bootleg ever.<BR></P><P><A id=Columbia.27s_release_of_The_Basement_Tapes_compilation name=Columbia.27s_release_of_The_Basement_Tapes_compilation></A></P><H2><SPAN class=mw-headline><FONT size=4>Columbia's release of <I>The Basement Tapes</I> compilation</FONT></SPAN></H2><P>On June 26, 1975, Columbia officially released a 24-song, double-album titled <I>The Basement Tapes</I>. Compiled and produced by Robbie Robertson, eight of the twenty-four songs did not feature Dylan, and of those eight, only four actually dated from the Big Pink sessions. All of the tracks were 'remixed' to mono while Robertson and other members of The Band overdubbed new piano, guitar, and/or drum parts over four of the original Dylan-Band recordings. Furthermore, songs like ~I Shall Be Released,~ ~<A title=~Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_the_Eskimo_%28The_Mighty_Quinn%29~>Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)</A>,~ ~Sign on the Cross,~ and ~I'm Not There (1956)~ were omitted, and the rough, first take of ~Too Much of Nothing~ was used in place of the later, comparatively flawless take copyrighted by Dwarf Music. (Critic <A title=~Greil Marcus~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greil_Marcus~>Greil Marcus</A> would later hail ~I'm Not There (1956)~ and ~Sign on the Cross~ as the best and second best songs, respectively, of the Big Pink sessions.)</P><P>Nevertheless, <I>The Basement Tapes</I> was initially hailed by critics, with <A title=~Robert Christgau~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Christgau~>Robert Christgau</A> giving it a rare A+ in his ~Consumer Guide~ column. ~These are the famous lost demos recorded at Big Pink in 1967 and later bootlegged on <I>The Great White Wonder</I> and elsewhere,~ wrote Christgau, apparently unaware of some of the changes made by Robertson. ~Because the Dylan is all work tape, the music is certifiably unpremeditated, lazy as a river and rarely relentless or precise — laid back without complacency or slickness. The writerly 'serious' songs like 'Tears of Rage' are all the richer for the company of his greatest novelties — if 'Going to Acapulco' is a dirge about having fun, 'Don't Ya Tell Henry' is a ditty about separation from self, and both modes are enriched by the Band's more conventional ('realistic') approach to lyrics. We needn't bow our heads in shame because this is the best album of 1975. It would have been the best album of 1967 too. And it's sure to sound great in 1983.~ Other critics agreed as <I>The Basement Tapes</I> topped <I><A title=~The Village Voice~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_Voice~>The Village Voice</A>'</I>s <A title=~Pazz &amp; Jop~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazz_%26_Jop~>Pazz &amp; Jop</A> Critics Poll for 1975, beating out <A title=~Patti Smith~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patti_Smith~>Patti Smith</A>'s <I><A title=~Horses (album)~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horses_%28album%29~>Horses</A></I>, <A title=~Bruce Springsteen~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen~>Bruce Springsteen</A>'s <I><A title=~Born to Run~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_to_Run~>Born to Run</A></I>, Dylan's own <I><A title=~Blood on the Tracks~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_on_the_Tracks~>Blood on the Tracks</A></I>, and <A title=~Neil Young~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Young~>Neil Young</A>'s <I><A title=~Tonight's the Night (album)~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonight%27s_the_Night_%28album%29~>Tonight's the Night</A></I>, the #2, 3, 4 and 5 ranking albums, respectively.</P><P>At the time, some critics lamented omissions like ~<A title=~Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_the_Eskimo_%28The_Mighty_Quinn%29~>Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)</A>~ and ~I Shall Be Released~ from <I>The Basement Tapes</I>, but the double-album only represented a fraction of the Big Pink recordings, and sure enough, a nearly-complete collection of the known recordings was eventually bootlegged as a 5-compact disc set known as <I>The Genuine Basement Tapes</I>; this collection is the centerpiece of <A title=~Greil Marcus~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greil_Marcus~>Greil Marcus</A>' well-known book of music journalism <I><A class=new title=~The Old, Weird America: The World of Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Old%2C_Weird_America:_The_World_of_Bob_Dylan%27s_Basement_Tapes&amp;action=edit~>The Old, Weird America: The World of Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes</A></I>.

The thesis of Marcus' book is that both collections accurately describe an alternate weirder history of the <A title=~United States~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States~>United States</A>.</P><P>While Columbia has issued only three more Big Pink recordings since <I>The Basement Tapes</I> (~I Shall Be Released~ and ~Sante Fe,~ both issued on <I><A title=~The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961-1991~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Volumes_1-3_%28Rare_%26_Unreleased%29_1961-1991~>The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961-1991</A></I>, as well as take 2 of ~<A title=~Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_the_Eskimo_%28The_Mighty_Quinn%29~>Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)</A>~ issued on <I><A title=~Biograph (album)~ href=~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biograph_%28album%29~>Biograph</A></I> in 1985), even more complete collections of Basement Tape material circulate freely among Dylan fans and collectors, under such titles as <I>A Tree With Roots</I>; most recent commercial bootlegs of the material are actually sourced from noncommercial fan projects.</P>"

It's a warm, friendly album, particularly since Bob Dylan is singing in a previously unheard gentle croon -- the sound of his voice is so different it may be disarming upon first listen, but it suits the songs. While there are a handful of lightweight numbers on the record, at its core are several excellent songs -- ~Lay Lady Lay,~ ~To Be Alone With You,~ ~I Threw It All Away,~ ~Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You,~ as well as a duet with Johnny Cash on ~Girl From the North Country~ -- that have become country-rock standards. And there's no discounting that Nashville Skyline, arriving in the spring of 1969, established country-rock as a vital force in pop music, as well as a commercially viable genre.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

While there are only a couple of genuine classics on the record (~If Not for You,~ ~One More Weekend~), the overall quality is quite high, and many of the songs explore idiosyncratic routes Dylan had previously left untouched, whether it's the jazzy experiments of ~Sign on the Window~ and ~Winterlude,~ the rambling spoken word piece ~If Dogs Run Free~ or the Elvis parable ~Went to See the Gypsy.~ Such offbeat songs make New Morning a charming, endearing record.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<p>Another Self Portrait, the tenth volume in Bob Dylan's official bootleg series, assembles a slew of unreleased tracks, un-and over-dubbed alternate takes, and demos, mostly from 1970's Self Portrait and New Morning sessions -- they were recorded simultaneously and released within months of one another -- and other material. Dylan restlessly dug into the fakebook of folk, blues, and country tunes that nourished him from the beginning. The few original songs are minor ones. Twenty-six of these 35 selections were recorded between March and June. Dylan is in fine voice and he tries on many: some raspy, others crystal clear, all of them bold. The interconnected nature of these albums is revealed with the opening demo for ~Went to See the Gypsy~ (used on NM). It's just Dylan and guitarist David Bromberg. (Another take recorded three months later features just Dylan on electric piano.) There are two undubbed takes of ~Little Sadie~ at different tempos; two of ~Time Passes Slowly~ -- the first a basic folk-rock read, the latter an aggressive one with Al Kooper's B-3 swelling to a crescendo from the jump. Dylan and Bromberg, with Kooper on piano, deliver a haunted, undubbed ~Days of 49.~ Many of the unreleased tunes are gems. ~Pretty Saro~ -- with Dylan in his cleanest Nashville Skyline croon displaying a real range -- and the vocal and piano read of ~Spanish Is the Loving Tongue~ are deeply moving love songs. ~House Carpenter~ is a high lonesome blues. The skeletal ~Alberta #3~ puts the versions from SP to shame. Eric Andersen's ~Thirsty Boots~ has Bromberg's spidery guitar weaving a separate lyric through Dylan's vocal. A demo of ~When I Paint My Masterpiece~ from 1971, contains slightly different (better) lyrics. The stripped-down ~Copper Kettle~ stands out when contrasted with its released version. Dylan was impatiently experimenting with arrangements on both records, particularly the latter, and some don't work. ~If Not for You~ features a violin instead of George Harrison's guitar. The unreleased ~Working on a Guru~ is almost a throwaway, but Harrison's blues-rock guitar playing smokes. The alternate ~New Morning,~ with a brassy, Stax-style horn arrangement, is great, but the full orchestral overdub on ~Sign on a Window~ -- complete with harp -- fails, as does the spoken word with female gospel backing chorus on ~If Dogs Run Free.~ Arguably, of the NM material, Dylan made the right choices for the finished album, which doesn't make what's here less interesting. The remainder of these tracks includes ~Minstrel Boy,~ an unreleased Basement Tapes number, and two tunes from the Isle of Wight with the Band, some alternates of Nashville Skyline, and others from 1971. Another Self Portrait asks many questions, but there is one that hounds because it's unanswerable, especially in regard to its namesake: why did Dylan record all this material, in this way, and then release something entirely different? It doesn't matter. For fans, this is more than a curiosity, it's an indispensable addition to the catalog.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><p>Bob Dylan (re)paints a masterpiece for the 10th edition of his Bootleg Series</p><p>I misheard Bob Dylan back in 1970 as I lay back on the single bed in my room at my folks suburban home in Marin County and listened again and again to Dylan's then-new and controversial album, Self Portrait, as it played on my shit Zenith portable stereo. There were no lyrics included with the album; no liner notes. Just a very long list of musicians who had played on it. Dylan sure wasn't offering any help in figuring out what he was up to, but then had he ever?</p><p>Self Portrait seemed confusing at first, a two-record set dominated by covers of other people's songs. Other people's songs? What the goddamn was the man who had intellectualized rock songwriting doing singing ~Blue Moon~ and ‘The Boxer' for God's sake?</p><p>It's fitting that I start this column with the word ~I,~ and that I'm telling you about my experience, the experience of one middle class 17-year-old boy who was ignorant of the history behind many of the songs Dylan covered on Self Portrait.</p><p>I didn't know B. Bryant, the writer of ~Take Me As I Am (Or Let Me Go),~ nor F. Bryant, who along with B. Bryant wrote ~Take A Message To Mary,~ (both songs included on Self Portrait) were famous Nashville songwriters Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, who wrote hits for the Everly Brothers, Roy Orbison, George Jones and many others. Or that ~Little Sadie,~ which Dylan claimed to have written, had been recorded almost 40 years earlier by Clarence Ashley. Hell, I'd not yet heard of Clarence Ashley. And who were the Lomax's, who along with F. Warner, were credited with writing the gold rush ballad ~Days of 49~?</p><p>I was 17. What the bejesus did I know?</p><p>Dylan often sang in the first person. Nineteen-sixty-three's ~Bob Dylan's 115th Dream~ begins with the line, ~I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.~ His 1965 single, ~Positively 4th Street,~ begins, ~You've got a lot of nerve to say you are my friend.~ The opening track on Dylan's new album, The Bootleg Series Vol. 10: Another Self Portrait (1969-1971), is a demo of New Morning's ~Went To See the Gypsy~ that begins, ~I went to see the gypsy, staying in a big hotel, he smiled when he saw me coming, and wished me well.~</p><p>I, he, he, me and me – in the very first line.</p><p>~I use I and me and you,~ Dylan told Allen Ginsberg during an interview in 1977. ~It's personal.~</p><p>It's personal. Maybe that's what drew me to Dylan when I heard ~Like A Rolling Stone~ on the radio in 1965 and flipped out. There was the voice and the music of course, but the way he sang so directly to the girl. This was between the singer and ~Miss. Lonely.~ And it was on the radio!</p><p>So personal.</p><p>There are many layers to Bob Dylan.</p><p>But I digress and I owe you more regards what I misheard.</p><p>The original Self Portrait starts with a line I heard as ~All the tired horses in the sun, how am I gonna get any writing done.~</p><p>Yes, I thought in 1970 as I tried to make sense of all those new Dylan recordings (24 tracks), after what Dylan's been through (the infamous motorcycle accident, the wall of hateful boos that greeted his switch to rock ‘n' roll, and all he'd accomplished including the recording of nine mind-blowing albums — most of them filled with his own idiosyncratic compositions), how was Bob Dylan going to write more songs? How could he top himself? Well he couldn't, of course. Yes I misheard, but what I thought was sung sounded like the truth. And if he was too tired to write new songs, well what else could he do?</p><p>What follows that song (which is sung by his backup singers – no Dylan vocal) is an album of Dylan singing mostly other people's songs. There are old songs (~Days of '49~), pop songs (~Blue Moon~), a few by his contemporaries (~The Boxer,~ ~Early Mornin' Rain~) and a few of his own oldies but goodies (including ~Like A Rolling Stone~ and ~She Belongs To Me,~ as played at the Isle of Wight in August 1969).</p><p>Self Portrait was an album of songs Dylan liked, and to some degree, songs that had influenced or impacted him. Self Portrait was Dylan as reflected through the mirror of his taste. But with Dylan, nothing is ever as it seems, so at the same time he was sharing a bit of himself, he was also fucking with us. Or was he?</p><p>In his memoir ~Chronicles,~ Dylan said he was tired of being ~the Big Bubba of Rebellion, High Priest of Protest, the Czar of Dissent, Kaiser of Apostasy, Archbishop of Anarchy, the Big Cheese.~ He wanted to escape an image the media and the public had imposed on him. So, he writes, he did what he could to shake things up, including the release in 1969 of Nashville Skyline, an album of simple country songs sung in a smooth country croon we'd never heard before.</p><p>And he followed up little over a year later with Self Portrait. ~I released one album (a double one),~ he wrote in ~Chronicles,~ where I just threw everything I could think of at the wall and whatever stuck, released it, and then went back and scooped up everything that didn't stick and released that, too.~</p><p>Only that wasn't true. Another Self Portrait is evidence that there were many other songs Dylan didn't release, plus alternate takes and demos. And while there's no reason to think Dylan wasn't trying to escape the ‘voice of a generation' straightjacket, the songs he recorded were no joke. This was no duck and cover operation. Critics and some of the public didn't get it, but so what?</p><p>In 1969, even before the commercial success of his country turn, Nashville Skyline (which reached #3 helped by the pop hit ~Lay Lady Lay~), Dylan was continuing to experiment with country music, but was also looking back to the old folk music (always a source of inspiration), perhaps searching for a new direction — recording old songs as he did when he and The Band recorded The Basement Tapes at Big Pink in 1967.</p><p>Dylan first recorded 11 songs during three days of sessions in the spring of 1969 in Nashville. Then over three days in March of 1970 he cut over 30 more songs in New York with musicians including David Bromberg (guitar/dobro) and Al Kooper (organ, piano). What is hard to believe, but apparently true, Dylan sent the New York tapes to Nashville for overdubs by Charlie McCoy (bass) and Kenneth Buttrey (drums) and a bunch of other Nashville cats. ~He [Dylan] wasn't even there,~ Buttrey is quoted as saying in Clinton Heylin's ~Bob Dylan: The Recording Sessions.~</p><p>Self Portrait was released in June of 1970 and the critical response was deafening.</p><p>With that one album it seemed at the time that Dylan instantly lost all the credibility he'd earned the previous decade. His staunchest defenders turned on him. ~What is this shit?~ Greil Marcus wrote in Rolling Stone.</p><p>But not me. I wrote a review praising Self Portrait that ran in the first (and only) issue of a magazine I co-published and co-edited, Hard Road (published in July 1970). I ended that review like this:</p><p>~Bob Dylan (Robert Zimmerman) has gone through many changes and this album is another change, another mood. Many people will dislike it because it sounds different than the Dylan they're used to. That's all right though because a few people will have moved along with Dylan and will really dig it.~</p><p>Yes, I liked it then and I like it now.</p><p>Oh but things might have been so different if the recordings on Another Self Portrait had been released in Self Portrait's place. Though I still dig Self Portrait, the new album blows it away. Listening to Another Self Portrait is a revelation. Remember the first time you heard Blonde On Blonde, or John Wesley Harding?</p><p>Yeah, that kind of mindblower.</p><p>It's a joy to listen to the album. Each song, as it plays, feels like a wondrous and unexpected gift, followed by an equally wondrous and unexpected gift.</p><p>Dylan's voice is in your face from the first song. And you remember how there was a time when he could really sing. Once he had a voice as distinctive as the one Salinger used to narrate ~The Catcher in the Rye.~ Dylan used many voices in the ‘60s and ‘70s – he moved from Okie folkie to sarcasm-dosed rocker to Nashville crooner. All those voices are wonderful, so full of emotion — and they all sound uniquely Bob Dylan. Those voices, as much as his words and music, are why he is such an important figure in 20th Century music.</p><p>All of those great voices and more are on Another Self Portrait.</p><p>With Another Self Portrait we get a mix of the original Dylan songs that ended up on New Morning and his distinctive covers. Most of the 35 songs on the two CDs (there is a four CD version that also includes Dylan and The Band's entire August 1969 Isle of Wight performance, and a remastered Self Portrait) were recorded in 1970 during the sessions for Self Portrait and New Morning. There are also a few alternative takes from the Nashville Skyline sessions of early 1969, one from The Basement Tapes, two from the Isle of Wight performance, and two previously unreleased versions of songs recorded in 1971 for Greatest Hits Vol. II.</p><p>There are demos and alternative takes, but just as impactful are seven recordings stripped of the Nashville overdubs. Those songs (two versions of ~Little Sadie,~ ~All the Tired Horses,~ ~Wigwam,~ ~Days of 49,~ ~Copper Kettle~ and ~Belle Isle~) are heard here as they were recorded with only David Bromberg, and occasionally Al Kooper accompanying Dylan.</p><p>If I had to pick out one song to sum up Another Self Portrait, it's the here-to-fore unheard ~Pretty Saro,~ a video of which appeared online two weeks before the album's August 27, 2013 release date. ~Pretty Saro~ began life as an English ballad. The words to Dylan's version are similar to those recorded in the early-to-mid ‘60s by Judy Collins, Pete Seeger and Jean Ritchie, but the music is different, and so is the melody that Dylan sings with his Nashville croon. The song lasts just over two minutes, and it is as mysterious and all-consuming as the Basement Tapes' recording, ~I'm Not There.~</p><p>It is a story old as love itself that Dylan sings to us. Down in a lone valley somewhere, ~a sad lonesome place,~ the singer is bidding farewell to pretty Saro, who he dreams of ~wherever I go.~ Pretty Saro won't have the singer because he has neither a big house nor the silver and gold he would need to win her love. Still, he tells us that if only he were ~a poet and could write a fine hand,~ that he'd write her a letter and she'd understand. ~But I dream of pretty Saro,~ he ends the song. ~Wherever I go.~</p><p>The lyrics are beautiful and haunting, but it's not those borrowed words that have me listening again and again. It's those minor chords that Dylan has added, and the beautiful flights his voice takes. Dylan doesn't just deliver the words, he sings them, and there is an ache in his voice containing all of life's defeats. A red rose that has been stepped on, that's the lonesome sound of Dylan's voice.</p><p>If you liked the Dylan of The Basement Tapes and John Wesley Harding and Nashville Skyline and New Morning, you'll like Another Self Portrait. If you are of a certain age, it may remind you of how you felt listening to the above albums when they were first released. I remember the relief I felt when in early 1968 I listened to ~Down Along the Cove~ and ~I'll Be Your Baby Tonight,~ the final tracks on John Wesley Harding. Dylan up in Woodstock; Dylan looking like a country gentleman on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post; Dylan making laid-back country music. It felt right, and I too wanted to get back to the country, even though I had no country to get back to having lived my whole life in that house in Marin. Oh to have a cabin in the woods, a creek nearby, and maybe an old rusting pickup to get around in. The other records that followed – Nashville Skyline, Self Portrait, New Morning – contained music to accompany sitting on the front porch of that imaginary cabin.</p><p>At the time Dylan's country voice was reassuring, a retreat from the craziness of Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde On Blonde or an advance past that craziness. The songs on Another Self Portrait, and the way they are sung brings back the comfort I felt listening to those albums way back then. I guess it could be nostalgia, which I'm no fan of, but I think it's something else.</p><p>What I think Dylan accomplished on his post-Blonde On Blonde, pre-Planet Waves albums was twofold. Not only did he change his voice and give up (temporarily) the rock ‘n' roll he'd been playing since '65, but he simplified his songwriting. It isn't that the songs are simplistic – mostly they're as sophisticated, maybe more sophisticated, than his previous writing, but he dispensed with the surrealism, and the layers and layers of wild images. According to Clinton Heylin, not long after his motorcycle accident Dylan told Allen Ginsberg ~he was writing shorter lines, with every line meaning something.~</p><p>Dylan's own writing became more like the old songs. On Another Self Portrait we get to hear ~Went to See the Gypsy~ followed by ~Little Sadie.~ A bunch of Dylan songs — ~Time Passes Slowly,~ ~Only A Hobo,~ ~Minstrel Boy~ and ~I Threw It All Away~ — are set among public domain songs and more recent covers including ~Spanish Is the Loving Tongue,~ Tom Paxton's ~Annie's Going To Sing Her Song,~ ~Railroad Bill~ and ~House Carpenter.~</p><p>Mixing it up as he does, we experience Dylan as part of the American folk tradition. Where once he sat at Woody Guthrie's feet, now he's Woody's equal. ~Only A Hobo~ is as sturdy a song as ~In Search of Little Sadie~ (which, by the way, is the better of the two versions of ~Little Sadie~ that Dylan recorded).</p><p>There are some fun ones here such as ~Working On A Guru~ which he recorded with George Harrison on guitar, and a version of ~Time Passes Slowly~ with Dylan and Harrison singing la la la la las. And as I keep listening, other favorites emerge including ~This Evening So Soon,~ which Dylan learned from Bob Gibson, who recorded it by it's real title, ~Tell Old Bill,~ in 1958, and ~House Carpenter,~ which Dylan probably heard performed by Clarence Ashley on Henry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music.</p><p>Another Self Portrait ends with a terrific version of ~When I Paint My Masterpiece.~ It's a solo recording with Dylan accompanying himself on piano. He sings a verse we haven't heard before: ~Sailin' around the world in a dirty gondola/ Sure wish I hadn't sold my old Victrola/ Ain't nothin' like that good ol' rock ‘n' rolla!~</p><p>Yeah baby!</p><p>When I misheard the lyric of ~All the Tired Horses~ all those years ago, I guess I misunderstood. Dylan hadn't run out of ideas. He had plenty more songs to write, and write them he did. He's still writing them. And even so late in the game, I wouldn't think of giving up on him. Plenty of people have been wrong about Dylan in the past, as Another Self Portrait conclusively proves.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Michael Goldberg</strong></p>"

Dylan didn't want the record to be released, and it's easy to see why -- the album is a collection of covers that are poorly performed on purpose. Tackling both contemporary writers (Joni Mitchell's ~Big Yellow Taxi,~ Jerry Jeff Walker's ~Mr. Bojangles~), pop songs (~Can't Help Falling in Love,~ ~A Fool Such as I~), and traditional numbers (~The Ballad of Ira Hayes,~ ~Spanish Is the Loving Tongue~), Dylan attempts to sabotage each number, but none of the results is quite so shocking, or funny, as the deconstructions on Self Portrait. While Dylan is indeed a negligible album, it isn't unlistenable -- it has a pleasant pop/rock sheen and Dylan sings in his Nashville Skyline croon. Nevertheless, its primary appeal is to die-hard fans with a perverse sense of humor.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>This album was unusual on several counts. For starters, it was a soundtrack (for Sam Peckinpah's movie of the same title), a first venture of its kind for Bob Dylan. For another, it was Dylan's first new LP in three years -- he hadn't been heard from in any form other than the single ~George Jackson,~ his appearance at the Bangladesh benefit concert in 1971, in all of that time. Finally, it came out at an odd moment of juxtaposition in pop culture history, appearing in July 1973 on the same date as the release of Paul McCartney's own first prominent venture into film music, on the Live and Let Die soundtrack (the Beatles bassist had previously scored The Family Way, a British project overlooked amid the frenzy of the Beatles' success). Interestingly, each effort reunited the artist with a significant musician/collaborator from his respective past: McCartney with producer George Martin and Dylan with guitarist Bruce Langhorne, who'd played with him on his early albums up to Bringing It All Back Home, before being supplanted by Mike Bloomfield, et al. But that was where the similarities between the two projects ended -- apart from the title song, Live and Let Die was Martin's project rather than McCartney's, whereas Dylan was all over Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid as a composer, musician, etc. Additionally, whereas McCartney's work was a piece of pure pop-oriented rock in connection with a crowd-pleasing action-fantasy film, Dylan's work comprised an entire LP, and the resulting album was a beautifully simple, sometimes rough-at-the-edges and sometimes gently refined piece of country- and folk-influenced rock, devised to underscore a very serious historical film by one of the movies' great directorial stylists. It was also as strong as any of his recent albums, featuring not just Langhorne but also such luminaries as Booker T. Jones, Roger McGuinn, and Byron Berline. ~Knockin' on Heaven's Door~ was the obvious hit off the album, and helped drive the sales, but ~Billy 1,~ ~Billy 4,~ and ~Billy 7~ were good songs, too -- had any of them shown up on bootlegs, they'd have kept the Dylan semiologists and hagiographers busy for years working over them. The instrumentals surrounding them were also worth hearing as manifestations of Dylan's music-making; ~Bunkhouse Theme~ was downright gorgeous. It was the first time since New Morning, in 1970, that Dylan had released more than five minutes of new music at once, and it was a gift to fans as well as to Peckinpah -- little did anyone realize at the time that it heralded a period of new recording and a national tour (with the Band), along with a brief label switch, and Dylan's greatest period of sustained musical visibility since 1966. This record also proved that Dylan could shoehorn his music within the requirements of a movie score without compromising its content or quality, something that only the Beatles, unique among rock artists, had really managed to do up to that time, and that was in their own movie, A Hard Day's Night. ~Knockin' on Heaven's Door~ may have been the biggest hit to come out of a Western in at least 21 years, since Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington had given ~High Noon~ to Tex Ritter to sing in Fred Zinnemann's High Noon in 1952 (and Katy Jurado was in both movies), and he'd also outdone Ritter on two counts, writing the music -- a full score, to boot -- and getting a cameo appearance in the film. The album was later kind of overlooked and neglected in the wake of the tour that followed and the imposing musical attributes of, say, Blood on the Tracks and Desire, but heard on its own terms it holds up 30-plus years later.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Following on the heels of an album where he repudiated his past with his greatest backing band, Blood on the Tracks finds Bob Dylan, in a way, retreating to the past, recording a largely quiet, acoustic-based album. But this is hardly nostalgia -- this is the sound of an artist returning to his strengths, what feels most familiar, as he accepts a traumatic situation, namely the breakdown of his marriage. This is an album alternately bitter, sorrowful, regretful, and peaceful, easily the closest he ever came to wearing his emotions on his sleeve. That's not to say that it's an explicitly confessional record, since many songs are riddles or allegories, yet the warmth of the music makes it feel that way. The original version of the album was even quieter -- first takes of ~Idiot Wind~ and ~Tangled Up in Blue,~ available on The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3, are hushed and quiet (excised verses are quoted in the liner notes, but not heard on the record) -- but Blood on the Tracks remains an intimate, revealing affair since these harsher takes let his anger surface the way his sadness does elsewhere. As such, it's an affecting, unbearably poignant record, not because it's a glimpse into his soul, but because the songs are remarkably clear-eyed and sentimental, lovely and melancholy at once. And, in a way, it's best that he was backed with studio musicians here, since the professional, understated backing lets the songs and emotion stand at the forefront. Dylan made albums more influential than this, but he never made one better.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>One doesn't have to be a broken-hearted straight male (or even a Nobel Prize voter) to fall in love with Bob Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks, but it might help. Filled with open-ended and often gender-specific pronouns, the yous, hers, hes, shes, and theys remain unnamed on all but one of the 10 songs on the moody 1975 epic, each a glowing invitation for listeners to fill in the blanks with their own nearest available emotional devastations. Often referred to as Dylan’s ~breakup album,~ it’s likewise become just that for many listeners, both expressing and absorbing great aloneness. Dylan himself professed confusion about the album’s popularity. ~It’s hard for me to relate to that,~ he said the year Blood on the Tracks was released. ~I mean, people enjoying that kind of pain.~</p><p>But as plenty have pointed out in the wake of Dylan’s Nobel for Literature, his music is about far more than just his lyrics, and Blood on the Tracks is a prime example of just what that more constitutes. Beyond the emotional wreckage, Blood on the Tracks might be Dylan’s most welcoming LP, its music projecting an undeniable warmth. The disc-opening ~Tangled Up in Blue~ uncorks the feels via an experimental narrative that fights conventional linearity, but the reasons to keep listening are contained in the first 11 seconds of forward motion before Dylan’s voice enters. Only after that do lyrics even matter, and (on Blood on the Tracks, anyway) he is pretty fantastic at both.</p><p>Blood on the Tracks is pleasing and complete enough to visit repeatedly, until the syllables become words, the words resolve into meanings, and all of it becomes internalized, a space accessible even without the presence of the album. Perhaps the least dated of Dylan’s recordings, there is a nakedness to everything. Untainted by the politics and cool of the ’60s or the gated drums and overdubbed productions of the ’80s, Blood on the Tracks hits with the same immediacy in the 21st century as it did in 1975.</p><p>Just as much as Pink Floyd or any other mid-’70s LP-minded artist, Dylan uses the studio to create and sustain a mood on Blood on the Tracks, and this mood is what survives. Drawing from two sets of sessions and at least three configurations of not-fully-identified musicians to capture a singular batch of songs, the album is a full package of writing, performance, and atmosphere. Withdrawing an early version of the album on the eve of release, musicians from sessions in New York disappeared into the credit of ~Eric Weissberg and Deliverance,~ and musicians recorded later in Minneapolis received no credit at all. Though he received no separate title on the album itself, it is also the first album on which Dylan himself served as sole producer, assembling musicians on his own, sometimes to confusing effect. While staying within the parameters of folk-rock, Dylan finds a rich array of approaches, moving between the vivid brightness of ~Tangled Up in Blue~ and ~You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,~ the soft-voiced late-night guitar/bass duets of ~Shelter From the Storm~ and ~Buckets of Rain,~ and the pained autumnal crispness of ~Idiot Wind.~</p><p>~Nobody sings Dylan like Dylan~ ran one of Columbia Records’ ’60s advertising campaigns, but by the early ’70s consumers were deluged with multiple generations of New Dylans, each expanding from territory that once belonged almost exclusively to Dylan, from Joni Mitchell to Bruce Springsteen, Leonard Cohen to Patti Smith. After a few years in the wilderness, when Dylan recorded for David Geffen’s Asylum Records (and Columbia released Dylan, scraping up unissued sessions without his consent), Blood on the Tracks might be seen as Dylan’s own assertion that nobody wrote Dylan like Dylan, either. For fans at the time, it was a revelation, both a few notches less cryptic than his ’60s surrealism, but no less mystical, folding in techniques of his old finger-pointin’ (~Idiot Wind~), blues-strummin’ (~Meet Me in the Morning~), vision-havin’ (~Shelter From the Storm~), and story-tellin’ (~Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts~) self, all while tapping into powerful new realms of vulnerability.</p><p>As a writer, Dylan had been through about three lightly overlapping phases over the previous 15 years—young and Woody (1960-1963), young and visionary (1964-1968), and young and happy (1969-1973), and Blood on the Tracks built on them while promising something more. Officially retired and raising children during the early ’70s, Dylan had deliberately downshifted into a less complex lyric style beginning with 1969’s Nashville Skyline, in part hoping to shake some of the obsessive global audience he’d attracted. New Morning and other country-pop sessions from the period found Dylan playing with some of the brighter textures he would employ on Blood on the Tracks, but his reluctance to write in the symbolism-laden voice of his earliest years soon resulted in a period when he ~more or less had amnesia,~ as he later told an interviewer. Returning to active songwriting in 1973 and the road in 1974 with the Band for Planet Waves, many of his latest songs seemed to lack the all-seeing perspective of his earlier work.</p><p>Dylan would say Blood on the Tracks was influenced by lecture classes he took with painter Norman Raeben in New York in early 1974. ~You’ve got yesterday, today, and tomorrow all in the same room,~ he said of the new lyric writing approach that resulted. Heard most vividly in the long-arc narratives of ~Tangled Up in Blue~ and ~Simple Twist of Fate,~ verses and lines present images like shuffled postcards connected by what Dylan referred to as a ~code.~ It is here that thinking of Blood on the Tracks as a ~breakup album~ becomes reductive, missing out on much of what the collection of songs has to offer, the ~breakup~ as much a concept as the bandshell concert loosely framing Sgt. Pepper’s. Just as much as relationships are about more than their breakups, breakup albums are about more than their relationships.</p><p>Though the disintegration of Dylan’s marriage might easily be spotted in nearly every song on the album, there are also meditations on the ineffable passage of time (~Tangled Up in Blue~), a transitory love affair in the present tense (~You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go~) and media jackyldom and other bummers (~Idiot Wind~). For that matter, a full third of the LP’s second side is concerned with ~Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts,~ a nine-minute 16-verse ballad that bucks the album’s signature themes of time regained, implacable loves, and unnamed names. Though remaining convincingly jaunty throughout with a light melody that catches the details in forensic clarity, its drawn-out story is a chore to decipher. Unlike the ambient emotional narratives of the rest of the album, the linear ballad requires a full and present attention, a reminder of one of the ways that music consumption is different than reading. Reportedly once considered for a film adaptation, the screen may’ve suited its stage-directed characters better than folk-rock. Further separating it from the rest, the blood spilled on this particular track doesn’t seem to be Dylan’s own, detracting from the album’s bigger picture and only underscoring the unifying power of the other nine songs.</p><p>Drawing on a range of songwriting tricks (including an open ~E~ tuning that assures that very few will play Dylan like Dylan, either), Blood on the Tracks emphasizes a feeling of raw expression. Singing live in the studio (with the exception of the overdubbed ~Meet Me in the Morning~), Dylan placed his usual focus on capturing in-the-moment performances. And though his reputation for studio and onstage spontaneity is well-deserved, Blood on the Tracks also presents songs that he had spent almost all of 1974 writing and reworking. Personal, perhaps, the songs easily transcend their would-be biographies. If Dylan's attitudes towards his partners sometimes stand out as patronizing—~You’re a Big Girl Now~ acting as an equally infantilizing bookend to 1966’s ~Just Like a Woman~—they reveal more about the nature of hurt than anything useful about the songwriter.</p><p>One glimpse into the making of the album comes through the version that Dylan very nearly released, scrapping it at the last moment, after jackets and test pressings had already been made. Playing an advance copy at a family gathering in Minnesota in over the holidays, Dylan—at the behest of his brother—decided he wanted a brighter sound, less of a downer. Flexing his superstar muscle and anticipating Neil Young, Kanye West, and others, he had the album recalled, pulling together a band of local folkies in the days after Christmas 1974 to rerecord half of the songs. The New York acetate (most recently offered in 2015 for $12,000) is all late night atmospherics, mostly just Dylan and bassist Tony Brown, the sound of the former’s coat-buttons brushing against his guitar strings. Though tracks have come out via various box sets, bootlegs of the New York sessions—sourced warmly from the acetate—are every bit as magical as the final product, a classic all its own, minus a clunkier ~Lily, Rosemary, the Jack of Hearts.~</p><p>In Minneapolis, Dylan brightened up the sound (changing keys on ~Tangled Up in Blue,~ striking a lighter keynote) and toned down some of the crueler lyrics (especially on ~If You See Her, Say Hello~). If atmosphere was lost (and it was, especially without the pedal steel-drenched ~You’re A Big Girl Now~), then accessibility was gained. Charting at #1 on its January 1975 release, Blood on the Tracks is arguably the last Dylan album on which a majority of the songs became standards of their own, part of the invisible canon shared at coffee houses, college campuses, or anywhere bright-eyed young pickers might congregate. In that way, it is also maybe Dylan’s last album of originals to qualify as ~folk music~ in both senses of the phrase: the popular genre defined by the presence of idioms and acoustic instruments, but also the great shared body of songs with lives and language that exist apart from their studio recordings and original performers. With the Byrds and many others achieving their own hits with his tunes and Dylan himself often circulating unrecorded work via folk music zines and songwriting demos, this had long been the expected fate of Dylan's songs.</p><p>Imagining Dylan as a simple songwriter, the template of Blood on the Tracks—sad boy with an acoustic guitar and a handful of chords—might seem basic, until one tries to replicate anything about it, or even just strum the songs at home. Blood on the Tracks lives alone in Dylan’s catalog, that open ~E~ tuning (which Dylan refused to explain to his musicians) often preventing the songs from sounding exactly right in the hands of others. It lives on in its own peculiar way. Dylan has seemed to keep ~Tangled Up In Blue~ in particular to himself, rewriting the song several times, both casually (playing fast and loose with the pronouns), and more formally, including a near-total rework released on 1984’s Real Live. One of the few older songs Dylan has performed consistently in recent years, even newer verses have emerged over the past half-decade. Nobody covers Dylan like Dylan either, apparently.</p><p>Though the albums on either side of Blood on the Tracks both made it to #1 and contained hints of the same songwriting territory, via Planet Waves’ ~Going, Going, Gone~ and Desire's ~Sara,~ especially, they were only just hints. Some of Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks persona remained visible via the two legs of the Rolling Thunder Revue, but the original open tuning never returned, and Dylan would soon bury his vulnerability, too. The surrealism would resurface in full force for 1978's Street-Legal, but the musical appeal didn’t. It took another few decades for Dylan even to return to the warm string-band sound of Blood on the Tracks, coming closest on his two 21st century albums of standards, Shadows in the Night and Fallen Angels. For a restless musician, it was a combination of factors that only came together once, locking together to transmit themselves through the years.</p><p>Even roughly 40 years later, Blood on the Tracks broadcasts hurt and longing so boldly it has become a stand-in, the type of shorthand a song licensor would deploy at the push of a button if it wasn’t so expensive and maybe too predictable. It manages a balance of old pain resolved and wounds so fresh they seem as if they might never heal, brutal personal assessment and doubt, unnecessary cruelties and real-time self-flagellation. While Blood on the Tracks can be a constant companion to listeners during periods of initial discovery, it (and Dylan’s whole catalog) has also become something to be lived with over a long period and put away for special occasions. Functioning like a literal album, the density of the passed time and pressed memories in ~Tangled Up in Blue~ grow richer with each passing year. As with the narratives of the songs themselves, Blood on the Tracks continues to absorb yesterday, today, and tomorrow, promising it can sustain new listeners as much as new meanings, should it ever have to be called back into service.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jesse Jarnow</strong></p>"

It was not confined to the Oran of Camus. No. It turned up again in America, breeding in-a-compost of greed and uselessness and murder, in those places where statesmen and generals stash the bodies of the forever young. The plague ran in the blood of men in sharkskin suits, who ran for President promising life and delivering death. The infected young men machine-gunned babies in Asian ditches; they marshalled metal death through the mighty clouds, up above God's green earth, released it in silent streams, and moved on, while the hospitals exploded and green fields were churned to mud. <P>And here at home, something died. The bacillus moved among us, slaying that old America where the immigrants lit a million dreams in the shadows of the bridges, killing the great brawling country of barnstormers and wobblies and home-run hitters, the place of Betty Grable and Carl Furillo and heavyweight champions of the world. And through the fog of the plague, most art withered into journalism. Painters lift the easel to scrawl their innocence on walls and manifestos. Symphonies died on crowded roads. Novels served as furnished rooms for ideology. <P>And as the evidence piled up, as the rock was pushed back to reveal the worms, many retreated into that past that never was, the place of balcony dreams in Loew's Met, fair women and honorable men, where we browned ourselves in the Creamsicle summers, only faintly hearing the young men march to the troopships, while Jo Stafford gladly promised her fidelity. Poor America. Tossed on a pilgrim tide. Land where the poets died. <P>Except for Dylan. <P>He had remained, in front of us, or writing from the north country, and remained true. He was not the only one, of course; he is not the only one now. But of all the poets, Dylan is the one who has most clearly taken the rolled sea and put it in a glass. <P>Early on, he warned us, he gave many of us voice, he told us about the hard rain that was going to fall, and how it would carry plague. In the teargas in 1968 Chicago, they hurled Dylan at the walls of the great hotels, where the infected drew the blinds, and their butlers ordered up the bayonets. Most of them are gone now. Dylan remains. <P>So forget the clenched young scholars who analyze his rhymes into dust. Remember that he gave us voice, When our innocence died forever, Bob Dylan made that moment into art. The wonder is that he survived. <P>That is no small thing. We live in the smoky landscape now, as the exhausted troops seek the roads home. The signposts have been smashed; the maps are blurred. There is no politician anywhere who can move anyone to hope; the plague recedes, but it is not dead, and the statesmen are as irrelevant as the tarnished statues in the public parks. We live with a callous on the heart. Only the artists can remove it. Only the artists can help the poor land again to feel. <P>And here is Dylan, bringing feeling back home. In this album, he is as personal and as universal as Yeats or Blake; speaking for himself, risking that dangerous opening of the veins, he speaks for us all. The words, the music, the tones of voice speak of regret, melancholy, a sense of inevitable farewell, mixed with sly humor, some rage, and a sense of simple joy. They are the poems of a survivor. The warning voice of the innocent boy is no longer here, because Dylan has chosen not to remain a boy. It is not his voice that has grown richer, stronger, more certain; it is Dylan himself. And his poetry, his troubadour's traveling art, seems to me to be more meaningful than ever. I thought, listening to these songs, of the words of Yeats, walker of the roads of Ireland: ~We make out of the quarrel with others rhetoric, but of the quarrel with ourselves, poetry.~ <P>Dylan is now looking at the quarrel of the self. The crowds have moved back off the stage of history; we are left with the solitary human, a single hair on the skin of the earth. Dylan speaks now for that single hair. <P>If you see her, <BR>Say hello. <BR>She might be in Tangiers...* <P>So begins one of these poems, as light as a slide on ice, and as dangerous. Dylan doesn't fall in. Instead, he tells us the essentials; a woman once lived, gone off, vanished into the wild places of the earth, still loved. <P>If you're makin' love to her, <BR>Kiss her for the kid. <BR>Who always has respected her, <BR>for doin' what she did...* <P>It is a simple love song, of course, which is the proper territory of poets, but is about love filled with honor, and a kind of dignity, the generosity that so few people can summon when another has become a parenthesis in a life. That song, and some of the other love poems in this collection, seem to me absolutely right, in this moment at the end of wars, as all of us, old, young, middle-aged, men and women, are searching for some simple things to believe in. Dylan here tips his hat to Rimbaud and Verlaine, knowing all about the seasons in hell, but he insists on his right to speak of love, that human emotion that still exists, in Faulkner's phrase, in spite of, not because. <P>And yes, there is humor here too, a small grin pasted over the hurt, delivered almost casually, as if the poet could control the chaos of feeling with a few simply chosen words: <P>Life is sad <BR>Life is a bust. <BR>All ya can do. <BR>Is do what you must. <BR>You do what you must do, <BR>And ya do it will. <BR>I'll do it for you, <BR>Ah, honey baby, can't ya tell?** <P>A simple song. Not Dante's Inferno, and not intended to be. But a song which conjures up the American road, all the busted dreams of open places, boxcars, the Big Dipper pricking the velvet night. And it made me think of Ginsberg and Corso and Ferlinghetti, and most of all, Kerouac, racing Deam Mariarty across the country in the Fifties, embracing wind and night, passing Huck Finn on the riverbanks, bouncing against the Coast, and heading back again, with Kerouac dreaming his songs of the railroad earth. Music drove them; they always knew they were near New York when they picked up Symphony Sid on the radio. In San Francisco they declared a Renaissance and read poetry to jazz, trying to make Mallarme's dream flourish in the soil of America. They failed, as artist generally do, but in some ways Dylan has kept their promise. <P>Now he has moved past them, driving harder into self. Listen to ~Idiot Wind.~ It is a hard, cold-blooded poem about the survivor's anger, as personal as anything ever committed to a record. And yet is can also stand as the anthem for all who feel invaded, handled, bottled, packaged; all who spent themselves in combat with the plague; all who ever walked into the knives of humiliation or hatred. The idiot wind trivialized lives into gossip, celebrates fad and fashion, glorifies the dismal glitter of celebrity. Its products live on the covers of magazines, in all of television, if the poisoned air and dead grey lakes. But most of all, it blows through the human heart. Dylan knows that such a wind is the deadliest enemy of art. And when the artists die, we all die with them. <P>Or listen to the long narrative poem called ~Lily, Rosemary And The Jack of Hearts.~ It should not be reduced to notes, or taken out of context; it should be experienced in full. The compression of story is masterful, but its real wonder is in the spaces, in what the artist left out of his painting. To me, that has always been the key to Dylan's art. To state things plainly is the function of journalism; but Dylan sings a more fugitive song: allusive, symbolic, full of imagery and ellipses, and by leaving things out, he allows us the grand privilege of creating along with him. His song becomes our song because we live in those spaces. If we listen, if we work at it, we fill up the mystery, we expand and inhabit the work of art. It is the most democratic form of creation. <P>Totalitarian art tells us what to feel. Dylan's art feels, and invites us to join him. <P>That quality is in all the work in this collection, the long, major works, the casual drawings and etchings. There are some who attack Dylan because he will not rewrite ~Like a Rolling Stone~ or ~Gates of Eden.~ They are fools because they are cheating themselves of a shot at wonder. Every artist owns a vision of the world, and he shouts his protest when he sees evil mangling that vision. But he must also tell us the vision. Now we are getting Dylan's vision, rich and loamy, against which the world moved so darkly. To enter that envisioned world, is like plunging deep into a mountain pool, where the rocks are clear and smooth at the bottom. <P>So forget the Dylan whose image was eaten at by the mongers of the idiot wind. Don't mistake him for Isaiah, or a magazine cover, or a leader of guitar armies. He is only a troubadour, blood brother of Villon, a son of Provence, and he has survived the plague. Look: he has just walked into the courtyard, padding across the flagstones, strumming a guitar. The words are about ~flowers on the hillside bloomin' crazy/Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme...~ A girl, red-haired and melancholy, begins to smile. Listen: the poet sings to all of us: <P>But I'll see you in the sky above, <BR>In the tall grass, <BR>In the ones I love. <BR>You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.*** <BR>-- Pete Hamill, New York, 1974 <BR>&nbsp; <P>*from ~If You See Her, Say Hello,~ ©1974 Ram's Horn Music.

As such, it may seem a little anticlimactic since it has none of the wildness of the best Dylan and Band music of the '60s -- just an approximation of the homespun rusticness. Considering that the record was knocked out in the course of three days, its unassuming nature shouldn't be a surprise, and sometimes it's as much a flaw as a virtue, since there are several cuts that float into the ether. Still, it is a virtue in places, as there are moments -- ~On a Night Like This,~ ~Something There Is About You,~ the lovely ~Forever Young~ -- where it just gels, almost making the diffuse nature of the rest of the record acceptable.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>The biggest criticism of The Bootleg Series, Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975 -- the third installment in Columbia/Legacy's excavation of the exhaustive Bob Dylan vaults (the first was a box set, containing three volumes) -- is that it's a compilation of highlights from his Rolling Thunder Revue of 1975, one that doesn't set out to replicate a set list but instead offers two discs and 22 tracks from this fabled tour. Apart from that, there's very little to complain about on this superlative set, which offers the first official release of Rolling Thunder material. Yes, this had been heavily bootlegged over the decades, plus it was documented on Dylan's notoriously unwatchable film Renaldo & Clara and there was Hard Rain, a collection culled from the post-Thunder 1976 tour that was similar but sour and nowhere near as good the 1975 material, as this superb set illustrates. Hearing this is a revelation, even for serious Dylan watchers -- those so serious to own several bootlegs, even a full shelf of Dylan, but not as obsessive as those who track Bob's every move -- and those who aren't as dedicated, yet still harbor a serious interest, will find this equally absorbing, since this is simply tremendous. It has become legend that Dylan will change arrangements and switch lyrics at the drop of a hat, which was evident on his jaunt with the Band in 1974, preserved for posterity on Before the Flood. Even so, he's looser, wilder, and more alive in this careening, thrilling album, a record where ~A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall~ gallops along as if it were ~Leopard Skin Pill-Box Hat.~ As that suggests, the wildest thing about this is the electric cuts, where an unwieldy band turns out an overpowering sound that sounds inevitable, as if it's the only way these songs could be played, even when you've heard these songs countless times before in other arrangements. The acoustic moments don't pack the same charge, nor do they contain many of his duets with Joan Baez, yet they're intimate, passionate versions of the songs. In fact, there's not a bad moment here, and if it doesn't replicate the Rolling Thunder tour list to the letter, it does indeed capture the essence of this legendary stint, which is why it's necessary for every serious fan.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Perhaps that's because Bob Dylan was uncertain himself, not just writing a set of songs with no connecting themes, but replacing the sprawl of the Rolling Thunder Revue with a slick, professional big band, featuring a horn section and several backing vocalists. The interesting thing about this is that the music and slick production don't jibe with the songs, which are as dense as anything Dylan had written since before his motorcycle accident. So, Street Legal becomes an interesting dichotomy, filled with songs that deserve close attention but recorded in arrangements that discourage such listening. As such, Street Legal is fascinating just for that reason -- in another setting, these are songs that would have been hailed as near-masterpieces, but covered in gloss, they seem strange. Consequentially, it's not surprising that there are factions of Dylanphiles that find this worth the time, while just as many consider it a missed opportunity.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Dylan himself may be part of that audience, since he did back away from such a staunchly dogged viewpoint not long afterward, but that doesn't change Saved's status as being a fairly flat -- and, for Dylan, fairly pedestrian -- testament to his faith. And, if Slow Train Coming found him at a fairly creative peak of songwriting and supported by a supple backing band, he's turning out routine songs here, and the backing follows suit, resulting in his flattest record yet.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Like many who have been born again, Dylan spoke and sang solely of his faith for a brief period -- roughly half a year, beginning in November of 1979 and ending in May of 1980. Facing a fan base who were generally furious at his newfound religion, Dylan started to thread some oldies into his set lists but he didn't leave gospel behind until he released Infidels in 1983.</p><p>Once he returned to secular music, he didn't abandon all the songs that he wrote during this period -- and it's also unclear what became of his faith, as he stopped speaking of it in concrete terms in public -- yet these three years remained one of Dylan's least understood phases, possibly because the studio albums he released between 1979 and 1981 were cocooned in studio gloss. Trouble No More, the 13th instalment of The Bootleg Series, attempts to right the record by collecting a wealth of live material from this period, supplementing these cuts with unreleased studio tracks, including a few songs that have never seen the light of day.<p>Whether it's appreciated in its lavish eight-CD/single-DVD box set or its judiciously edited double-disc companion, Trouble No More performs the same function: it illuminates the passion driving this music. Unlike Another Self Portrait, this Bootleg Series installment offers a different perspective of a maligned phase, but it doesn't provide a jolting revelation, not even with several unveiled Dylan originals in tow. A few of these songs would've enhanced either Saved or Shot of Love -- in particular, ~Ain't Gonna Go to Hell for Anybody~ feels robust as it dodges confession -- but the execution matters more than the content. Dylan did write a handful of classics during this time but the tunes tend to be overshadowed by the ragged, soulful performances, where the songs -- both major and minor -- get reshaped on-stage and in the studio. The band impresses -- this music, which sounded so slick on the released records, has grit, swing and soul -- but they're only following their leader, who is chasing a muse that may still remain elusive to his audience.</p><p>Dylan may not articulate his conversion in words -- these are among his stiffest lyrics, allowing no room for ambiguity yet still bearing some playfulness -- but Trouble No More, more than Saved or even the fine Slow Train Coming, is buoyed by the music. Whether he's singing a slight song, easing into testimony, or leaning into a blues, Dylan seems engaged, even on the verge of rapture, an excitement that carries through the full live shows from 1980 and 1981 on the Deluxe Edition, where he reworks his old tunes -- ~Maggie's Farm~ is driven by a wild, twisting riff -- in hopes that they open the door to his new thing. Few appreciated his trip at the time, but years later it feels compelling, possibly because it's allowed to be messy and soulful within the parameters of The Bootleg Series.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

There was cohesion on <i>Empire Burlesque</i>, of course, but that cohesion was a little too slick, a little too commercial, whereas this record was filled with atmospheric, hazy production -- a sound as arty as most assumed the songs to be. And Dylan followed suit, giving Lanois significant songs -- palpably social works, love songs, and poems -- that seemed to connect with his past. And, at the time, this production made it seem like the equivalent of his '60s records, meaning that its artiness was cutting edge, not portentous. Over the years, <i>Oh Mercy</i> hasn't aged particularly well, seeming as self-conscious as such other gauzy Lanois productions as <i>So</i> and <i>The Joshua Tree</i>, even though it makes more sense than the ersatz pizzazz of Burlesque. Still, the songs make Oh Mercy noteworthy; they find Dylan quietly raging against the materialism of President Reagan and accepting maturity, albeit with a slight reluctance. So, <i>Oh Mercy</i> is finally more interesting for what it tries to achieve than for what it actually does achieve. At its best, this is a collection of small, shining moments, with the best songs shining brighter than their production or the album's overall effect.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

Instead, he delivered a record of folk songs, his first straight covers album ever, not to mention his first guitar, harmonica, and voice record since the early '60s. That alone would make it an anomaly, but Good as I Been to You is more than that, because it's a really good traditional folk album, having just enough familiar tunes -- ~Frankie & Albert,~ ~Blackjack Davey,~ ~Sittin' on Top of the World,~ ~Froggie Went a Courtin'~ -- to provide an entryway to the less familiar numbers, which are delivered equally well. Yes, this could be seen as a rather unassuming record, but that's what's special about it. In 1992, not even folksingers were working with this material, but Dylan did, reviving folk's (and rock's) ties to the past at an unexpected time and with unexpectedly strong results. A minor high point in his catalog.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b></p>"

				"review": "<p>After spending much of the '90s touring and simply not writing songs, Bob Dylan returned in 1997 with Time Out of Mind, his first collection of new material in seven years. Where Under the Red Sky, his last collection of original compositions, had a casual, tossed-off feel, Time Out of Mind is carefully considered, from the densely detailed songs to the dark, atmospheric production. Sonically, the album is reminiscent of Oh Mercy, the last album Dylan recorded with producer Daniel Lanois, but Time Out of Mind has a grittier foundation -- by and large, the songs are bitter and resigned, and Dylan gives them appropriately anguished performances. Lanois bathes them in hazy, ominous sounds, which may suit the spirit of the lyrics, but are often in opposition to Dylan's performances. Consequently, the album loses a little of its emotional impact, yet the songs themselves are uniformly powerful, adding up to Dylan's best overall collection in years. It's a better, more affecting record than Oh Mercy, not only because the songs have a stronger emotional pull, but because Lanois hasn't sanded away all the grit. As a result, the songs retain their power, leaving Time Out of Mind as one of the rare latter-day Dylan albums that meets his high standards.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

There are none of the foreboding, apocalyptic warnings that permeated Time Out of Mind and even underpinned ~Things Have Changed,~ his Oscar-winning theme to Curtis Hanson's 2000 film Wonder Boys. Just as important, Daniel Lanois' deliberately arty, diffuse production has retreated into the mist, replaced by an uncluttered, resonant production that gives Dylan and his ace backing band room to breathe. And they run wild with that liberty, rocking the house with the grinding ~Lonesome Day Blues~ and burning it down with the fabulously swinging ~Summer Days.~ They're equally captivating on the slower songs, whether it's the breezily romantic ~Bye and Bye,~ the torch song ~Moonlight,~ or the epic reflective closer, ~Sugar Baby.~ Musically, Dylan hasn't been this natural or vital since he was with the Band, and even then, those records were never as relaxed and easy or even as hard-rocking as these. That alone would make Love and Theft a remarkable achievement, but they're supported by a tremendous set of songs that fully synthesize all the strands in his music, from the folksinger of the early '60s, through the absurdist storyteller of the mid-'60s, through the traditionalist of the early '70s, to the grizzled professional of the '90s. None of this is conscious, it's all natural. There's an ease to his writing and a swagger to his performance unheard in years -- he's cracking jokes and murmuring wry asides, telling stories, crooning, and swinging. It's reminiscent of his classic records, but he's never made a record that's been such sheer, giddy fun as this, and it stands proudly among his very best albums.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>When Bob Dylan dropped Time Out of Mind in 1997, it was a rollicking rockabilly and blues record, full of sad songs about mortality, disappointment, and dissolution. 2001 brought Love and Theft, which was also steeped in stomping blues and other folk forms. It was funny, celebratory in places and biting in others. Dylan has been busy since then: he did a Victoria's Secret commercial, toured almost nonstop, was in a couple films -- Larry Charles' Masked and Anonymous and Martin Scorsese's documentary No Direction Home -- and published the first of a purported three volumes of his cagey, rambling autobiography, Chronicles. Lately, he's been thinking about Alicia Keys. This last comment comes from the man himself in ~Thunder on the Mountain,~ the opening track on Modern Times, a barn-burning, raucous, and unruly blues tune that finds the old man sounding mighty feisty and gleefully agitated: ~I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys/Couldn't keep from cryin'/She was born in Hell's Kitchen and I was livin' down the line/I've been lookin' for her even clear through Tennessee.~ The drums shuffle with brushes, the piano is pumping like Jerry Lee Lewis, the bass is popping, and a slide guitar that feels like it's calling the late Michael Bloomfield back from 1966 -- à la Highway 61 Revisited -- slips in and out of the ether like a ghost wanting to emerge in the flesh. Dylan's own choppy leads snarl in the break and he's letting his blues fall down like rain: ~Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches/I'll recruit my army from the orphanages/ I've been to St. Herman's church and said my religious vows/I sucked the milk out of a thousand cows/I got the pork chop, she got the pie/She ain't no angel and neither am I...I did all I could/I did it right there and then/I've already confessed I don't need to confess again.~</p><p>Thus begins the third part of Dylan's renaissance trilogy (thus far, y'all). Modern Times is raw; it feels live, immediate, and in places even shambolic. Rhythms slip, time stretches and turns back on itself, and lyrics are rushed to fit into verses that just won't stop coming. Dylan produced the set himself under his Jack Frost moniker. Its songs are humorous and cryptic, tender and snarling. What's he saying? We don't need to concern ourselves with that any more than we had to Willie Dixon talking about backdoor men or Elmore James dusting his broom. Dylan's blues are primitive and impure. Though performed by a crackerjack band, they're played with fury; the singer wrestles down musical history as he spits in the eye of the modern world. But blues isn't the only music here. There are parlor songs such as ~Spirit on the Water,~ where love is as heavenly and earthly a thing as exists in this life. The band swings gently and carefree, with Denny Freeman and Stu Kimball playing slippery -- and sometimes sloppy -- jazz chords as Tony Garnier's bass and George Receli's sputtering snare walk the beat. Another, ~When the Deal Goes Down,~ tempts the listener into thinking that Dylan is aping Bing Crosby in his gravelly, snake-rattle voice. True, he's an unabashed fan of the old arch mean-hearted crooner. But it just ain't Bing, because it's got that true old-time swing.</p><p>Dylan's singing style in these songs comes from the great blues and jazzman Lonnie Johnson (whose version of the Grosz and Coslow standard ~Tomorrow Night~ he's been playing for years in his live set). If you need further proof, look to Johnson's last recordings done in the late '50s and early '60s (~I Found a Dream~ and ~I'll Get Along Somehow~), or go all the way back to the early years for ~Secret Emotions,~ and ~In Love Again,~ cut in 1940. It is in these songs where you will find the heart of Dylan's sweet song ambition and also that unique phrasing that makes him one of the greatest blues singers and interpreters ever. Dylan evokes Muddy Waters in ~Rollin' and Tumblin.~ He swipes the riff, the title, the tune itself, and uses some of the words and adds a whole bunch of his own. Same with his use of Sleepy John Estes in ~Someday Baby~.. Those who think Dylan merely plagiarizes miss the point. Dylan is a folk musician; he uses American folk forms such as blues, rock, gospel, and R&B as well as lyrics, licks, and/or whatever else he can to get a song across. This tradition of borrowing and retelling goes back to the beginning of song and story. Even the title of Modern Times is a wink-eye reference to a film by Charlie Chaplin. It doesn't make Dylan less; it makes him more, because he contains all of these songs within himself. By his use of them, he adds to their secret histories and labyrinthine legends. Besides, he's been around long enough to do anything he damn well pleases and has been doing so since the beginning.</p><p>Modern Times expresses emotions and comments upon everything from love (~When the Deal Goes Down,~ ~Beyond the Horizon~) to mortality (~The Levee's Gonna Break,~ ~Ain't Talkin~) to the state of the world -- check ~Workingman's Blues #2,~ where Dylan sings gently about the ~buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down/Money's getting shallow and weak...they say low wages are reality if we want to compete abroad.~ But in the next breath he's put his ~cruel weapons on the shelf~ and invites his beloved to sit on his knee. It's a poignant midtempo ballad that walks the line between the topical songs of Cisco Houston and Woody Guthrie to the love songs of Stephen Foster and Leadbelly. One can feel both darkness and light struggling inside the singer for dominance. But in his carnal and spiritual imagery and rakish honesty, he doesn't give in to either side and walks the hardest path -- the ~long road down~ to his own destiny. This is a storyteller, a pilgrim who's seen it all; he's found it all wanting; he's found some infinitesimal take on the truth that he's holding on to with a vengeance. In the midst of changes that are foreboding, Modern Times is the sound of an ambivalent Psalter coming in from the storm, dirty, bloodied, but laughing at himself -- because he knows nobody will believe him anyway.</p><p>Dylan digs deep into the pocket of American song past in ~Nettie Moore,~ a 19th century tune from which he borrowed the title, the partial melody, and first line of its chorus. He also uses words by W.C. Handy and Robert Johnson as he extends the meaning of the tome by adding his own metaphorical images and wry observations. However, even as the song is from antiquity, it's full of the rest of Modern Times bemusement. ~The Levee's Gonna Break~ shakes and shimmies as it warns about the coming catastrophe. Coming as it does on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, it's a particularly poignant number that reveals apocalypse and redemption and rails on the greedy and powerful as it parties in the gutter. There are no sacred cows -- when Dylan evokes Carl Perkins' exhortation to put ~your cat clothes on,~ it's hard not to stomp around maniacally even as you feel his righteousness come through. The great irony is in the final track, ~Ain't Talkin',~ where a lonesome fiddle, piano, and hand percussion spill out a gypsy ballad that states a yearning, that amounts to an unsatisfied spiritual hunger. The pilgrim wanders, walks, and aspires to do good unto others, though he falters often -- he sometimes even wants to commit homicide. It's all part of the ~trawl~ of living in the world today. Dylan's simmering growl adds a sense of apprehension, of whistling through the graveyard, with determination to get to he knows not where -- supposedly it's the other side of the world. The guitar interplay with the fiddle comes through loud and clear in the bittersweet tune. It's like how ~Beyond the Horizon~ uses gypsy melodies and swing to tenderly underscore the seriousness in the words. It sends the album off with a wry sense of foreboding. This pilgrim is sticking to the only thing he knows is solid -- the motion of his feet.</p><p>Modern Times portrays a new weird America, even stranger than the old one, because it's merely part of a world consumed by insanity. In these ten songs, bawdy joy, restless heartache, a wild sense of humor, and bottomless sadness all coexist and inform one another as a warning and celebration of this precious human life while wondering openly about what comes after. This world view is expressed through musical and lyrical forms that are threatened with extinction: old rickety blues that still pack an electrically charged wallop, porch and parlor tunes, and pop ballads that could easily have come straight from the 1930s via the 1890s, but it also wails and roars the blues. Modern Times is the work of a professional mythmaker, a back-alley magician, and a prophetic creator of mischief. He knows his characters because he's been them all and can turn them all inside out in song: the road-worn holy man who's also a thief; the tender-hearted lover who loves to brawl; the poetic sage who's also a pickpocket; and the Everyman who embodies them all and just wants to get on with it. On Modern Times, all bets are off as to who finishes the race dead last, because that's the most interesting place to be: ~Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind/Bring me my boots and shoes/You can hang back or fight your best on the frontline/Sing a little bit of these workingman blues.~ There is nothing so intriguing as contradiction and Dylan offers it with knowing laughter and tears, because in his songs he displays that they are both sides of the same coin and he never waffles, because he's on the other side of the looking glass. Modern Times is the work of an untamed artist who, as he grows older, sees mortality as something to accept but not bow down to, the sound that refuses to surrender to corruption of the soul and spirit. It's more than a compelling listen; it's a convincing one.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"firstname": "",
		"lastname": "Emerson, Lake & Palmer",
		"name": "Emerson, Lake & Palmer",
		"biography": "<P>Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer were progressive rock's first supergroup. Greeted by the rock press and the public as something akin to conquering heroes, they succeeded in broadening the audience for progressive rock from hundreds of thousands into tens of millions of listeners, creating a major radio phenomenon as well. Their flamboyance on record and in the studio echoed the best work of the heavy metal bands of the era, proving that classical rockers could compete for that arena-scale audience. Over and above their own commercial success, the trio also paved the way for the success of such bands as Yes, who would become their chief rivals for much of the 1970s.</P><P>Keyboardist Keith Emerson planted the seeds of the group in late 1969 when his band the Nice shared a bill at the Fillmore West with King Crimson, an up-and-coming band that featured lead singer and bassist Greg Lake. Emerson and Lake first discussed the possibility of collaborating at that point, but only after the Crimson lineup began disintegrating during their first U.S. tour did he finally opt to leave the group (after agreeing to sing on the forthcoming Crimson album). Upon officially teaming in 1970, Emerson and Lake auditioned several drummers, including Mitch Mitchell, before they approached Carl Palmer, a former member of the Crazy World of Arthur Brown who later hooked up with bandmate Vincent Crane in an experimental band called Atomic Rooster.</P><P>The trio's first rehearsals mostly picked up from the Nice's and King Crimson's repertoires, including such well-known numbers as ~Rondo~ and ~21st Century Schizoid Man.~ In August of 1970, even as they were working on the songs that would ultimately comprise their first album, ELP played its first show at the Plymouth Guildhall, just ahead of the Isle of Wight Festival in August of 1970. The group's self-titled debut album was finished the following month and released in November; an instant success, it rose to the Top Five in England and the Top 20 in America. The single ~Lucky Man~ also was a hit, and their stage act rapidly became the stuff of legend.</P><P>The recording of the second ELP album, 1971's Tarkus, tested their cohesiveness while stretching their sound in new directions. Emerson was interested in further exploiting the range of the Moog synthesizer, and had conceived of an extended suite built around an opening eruption of sound, while Palmer had come up with an unusual drum pattern that he was eager to use. When they tried to present their ideas to Lake, who had assumed the mantle of producer with the first album, however, he couldn't really grasp the piece. He balked, and arguments ensued, and for a time it looked as though there might be no second album.</P><P>The group eventually agreed to disagree about the proposed track: ~Tarkus~ became the title of the new album, and ultimately defined the ELP sound as most people understood it — the song was loud and bombastic, somewhat gloomy in its lyrical tone, and exultant in its instrumental power. A descendant of ~The Three Fates~ and ~Tank~ from the first album, ~Tarkus~ was a much denser piece of music, featuring not only multiple overdubs of instruments but textures that ultimately proved very difficult to re-create on-stage. After Tarkus hit the number one spot on the English charts and reached the Top Ten in America, their March 21, 1971, concert at Newcastle City Hall — featuring the group's adaptation of Mussorgsky's ~Pictures at an Exhibition~ — was recorded for release, and became another major hit.</P><P>It was eight months before ELP's next record, Trilogy, was released in July of 1972. In the interim, they toured extensively, and made it their business to cultivate the college audience that took most naturally to their work. With Trilogy, the partnership was back fully in balance, with each member taking an equal share of musical responsibility. Moreover, Lake never sang better, nor did the group ever sound more comfortable and laid-back; among the eight very solid numbers in a classical-rock vein, there was tucked a track that became virtually the band's signature tune, a version of Aaron Copland's Hoedown.<P><P>Such was the group's credibility that when it came time to record a version of the first movement of Alberto Ginastera's Piano Concerto No. 1 and the publisher denied them permission, they approached the composer himself, who fully approved and applauded the track that became ~Tocatta~ on Brain Salad Surgery, released in 1973 on their own record label, Manticore (named for one of the mythological creatures portrayed in ~Tarkus~). Through Manticore, ELP also released material by Pete Sinfield and the Italian progressive rock band PFM; Sinfield's presence as a composer with Lake on Brain Salad Surgery helped strengthen one of the group's lingering weaknesses, its lyrics — where Lake's use of language had always tended toward the pleasant but simplistic, Sinfield, a veteran of King Crimson, provided lyrical complexity nearly as daunting as the best of the group's music.</P><P>In the wake of this string of successes, ELP released a triple live album, Welcome Back My Friends to the Show That Never Ends, in August of 1974, but their streak came to a halt with Works, an album that also marked the dissolution of the group sound. At the time, each member was feeling constrained by the presence of the others, and their inclination was to release a trio of solo albums; cooler heads prevailed, however, and they reasoned that none of their solo works would sell remotely as well as an ELP album. The result was Works, a double album released in March of 1977. The album consisted of three solo sides and a fourth side on which the group did two extended collaborative efforts, ~Pirates~ and ~Fanfare for the Common Man.~</P><P>The record fared poorly, and the group was never the same: Works destroyed ELP's unity, and their main motivation for recording seemed only to be their contractual obligations. Worse still, they'd squandered valuable time with work on the double album, time during which the public's taste was changing — the progressive bands were coming in for special criticism, and the notion of extended suites, conceptual rock albums, and classical-rock fusion now seemed hopelessly ponderous and pretentious as the rise of punk rock and disco seemed to undermine any notion of intellectualism in rock. Works, Vol. 2, released in November of 1977, was nothing more than a collection of obscure B-sides and odd tracks dating back four years, while their next album of new material, Love Beach, was later described by the bandmembers themselves as nothing more than a matter of going through the motions.</P><P>ELP split up in 1979: Lake embarked on a moderately successful solo career, Emerson took to composing film scores and recorded the occasional solo project, and after a stint with the band P.M., Palmer joined the pop supergroup Asia. In the mid-'80s, Emerson and Lake got together with drummer Cozy Powell as the short-lived Emerson, Lake &amp; Powell, complete with a self-titled 1985 album. In 1991, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer reunited for an album called Black Moon, followed by a fairly successful tour. In 1993, they released Live at Royal Albert Hall. Their attempt at another new album, In the Hot Seat, was doomed to failure by Emerson's development of a repetitive stress disorder in one hand, which required surgery and restricted the group's ability to record or perform.</P><P>— <B>Bruce Eder</B></P>",

Even here, in a relatively balanced collection of material, the album shows the beginnings of a dark, savage, imposingly gothic edge that had scarcely been seen before in so-called ~art rock,~ mostly courtesy of Emerson's larger-than-life organ and synthesizer attacks. Greg Lake's beautifully sung, deliberately archaic ~Lucky Man~ had a brush with success on FM radio, and Carl Palmer became the idol of many thousands of would-be drummers based on this one album (especially for ~Three Fates~ and ~Tank~), but Emerson emerged as the overpowering talent here for much of the public.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Bruce Eder</b></p>"

Dubbed Shahen-Shah-e-Qawwali (the Brightest Star in Qawwali), he was born on October 13, 1948, in Lyallpur in the Punjab Province of Pakistan. He made his first recording in 1973 in Pakistan and a number of early EMI (Pakistan) albums jointly billed him with his uncle Mubarak Ali Khan. Since these mainly cassette albums were invariably undated and numerous, it is difficult to place them in any more accurate chronological sequence than catalogue number order. Between 1973 and 1993 his recorded output could only be described as prodigious, with more than 50 album releases to his name on numerous Pakistani, British, American, European and Japanese labels. Heavily over-recorded, blighted with a rash of poppy remix albums or albums with Westernized instrumentation or arrangements, his recorded work is a mire to suck in the uninitiated and their money. Converts, however, do not escape scot-free. Although some releases hint at their nature with coded titles such as Volume 4 Punjabi (Oriental Star CD SR013) from 1990 or Ghazals Urdu (Oriental Star CD SR055) from 1992, the chosen language and style is frequently a matter of conjecture or uncertainty. While the Western market is saturated with his work, the Indian market is supersaturated, and his recorded output is in danger of overwhelming any sense of taste.</p><P>Real World was the label largely responsible for Khan's breakthrough into a non-Indian audience. It was their marketing skills and the platform provided by the WOMAD organization which introduced him to Westerners. Musst Musst (Real World CD RW 15) released in 1990 was a deliberate attempt to target the White market with its non-traditional arrangements, yet it seems positively cherubic beside later abominations. ~All these albums are experiments,~ he told me in 1993. ~There are some people who do not understand at all but just like my voice. I add new lyrics and modern instruments to attract the audience. This has been very successful.~ Success, however, bred indifference to the virtues and values of the original music. Many find the remix albums, the Western and youth-market releases a source of despair: buyer beware remains the watchword. When singing his traditional work he remains peerless. Many, including myself, regret the dilution of his talent that has occurred with his 'experiments.' However, in 1994, reportedly tired of unauthorized releases, he took greater control of both his business affairs and his concert and recording activities. With his international renown at an all-time peak, Khan died on August 16, 1997; a seemingly endless procession of posthumous releases appeared in the years to follow.</p>",

Filled with studio trickery, distorted microphones, and trendy vague trip-hop beats, the album was a deliberate move to establish himself as a separate, more adventurous entity from Crowded House — yet one that remained a gifted, melodic songwriter. This is all put into sharp relief by his second solo album, <i>One Nil</i>, a record that finds him returning to solid ground, delivering his most straightforward album since Crowded House's <i>Woodface</i>. Curiously, for an album that plays to his strengths, a good portion is the result of a fruitful collaboration with Wendy & Lisa, plus a production pairing with Tchad Blake and numerous cameo spots, including Sheryl Crow, Lisa Germano, and Mitchell Froom. For all the guests and star power, the record is surprisingly subtle, lacking the knockout punches of <i>Try Whistling This</i>, where the singles leapt out of the grooves. This time around, the songs are gently insinuating, slowly working their way into the subconscious. Even the songs with the biggest hooks, such as the first single ~Rest of the Day Off,~ aren't as immediate as ~She Will Have Her Way.~ Yet, on repeated plays, the record begins to gel, revealing itself as a reliably solid effort from Finn. There may not be any new revelations, yet the little details — the turns of phrase, the gently persuasive melodies, the slyly detailed productions — all confirm his status as a gifted craftsman. </p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

However, it wasn't until late 1989 that they actually started writing together — a reunion that yielded more than a dozen songs for a proposed Finn Brothers side project. That album was scrapped and most of the material was absorbed by Crowded House's <i>Woodface</i> (1991) and <i>Together Alone</i> (1993), as well as Tim's 1993 solo album, <i>Before & After</i>. The brothers' project resumed in late 1994, and in four weeks, they completed an album called simply <i>Finn</i>. The album, released in the fall of 1995 (the summer of 1996 in the U.S.), showed a much more casual side of the Finns and was less pop-oriented than their previous musical collaborations — the brothers play nearly all of the instruments themselves, ranging from the primitive to the exotic. After initial pressings of Finn, the duo changed their name to the Finn Brothers to avoid confusion with a band going under a similar name. In 2004 The Finn Brothers returned with <i>Everyone is Here</i>.</p>&mdash; <b>Chris Woodstra</b>",

				"review": "<p>Nearly ten years after their first album as a duo, the Finn Brothers returned with <i>Everyone Is Here</i> in the late summer of 2004. There was a considerably larger gap of time separating <i>Everyone Is Here</i> and <i>Finn</i> than there was between that album and <i>Woodface</i>, the one Crowded House album to feature Tim and the first time the brothers worked together since the disbandment of Split Enz. Only four years separated <i>Finn</i> and <i>Woodface</i>, while it took nearly a decade for the Finns to deliver a second album, and quite a bit happened during that time. Each brother released two studio albums and one live album (Tim's was a collaborative live effort, but it could be argued that Neil's star-studded <i>7 Worlds Collide</i> was collaborative too) and, more importantly, their mother Mary passed away, and all of this feeds into the spirit, vibe, and sensibility of <i>Everyone Is Here</i>. At its heart, this is an album about family — specifically, about being brothers. </p><p>This is the first time the Finns have written as directly and abundantly about their kinship, and unlike other famous rock siblings, the Finns' relationship is not only cordial but loving, which doesn't mean that it's any less complex than such legendarily combative brothers from the Everlys through the Gallaghers. Tim and Neil mine their relationship throughout the album — the word ~brother~ seems to appear here more often than the entirety of their past work — and they've come up with a moving set of songs that may not add up to a concept album yet are surely unified by a set of themes. Similarly, despite three different sets of producers (primarily Mitchell Froom, but also Jon Brion and Tony Visconti for individual tracks) the album boasts a unified sound, particularly in comparison to the rather ragged, seemingly unfinished Neil effort <i>One Nil</i> (distilled and strengthened in its American incarnation, One All) or Tim's <i>Feeding the Gods</i>. It's a meditative, expertly crafted mature pop record, filled with subtle sonic textures — ranging from banjos to harmoniums, all adding colors to layers of primarily acoustic guitars — that give this low-key, reflective music a rich variety of color. While <i>Everyone Is Here</i> lacks the brightness of much of <i>Woodface</i>, it's the Finn Brothers' strongest collection of songs since that masterpiece, and arguably their most emotionally resonant album to date. With any luck, it won't be another decade's wait until the sequel. </p><p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b></p>"

Although she began gaining notice with competition prizes and concert appearances from 1995, she achieved international renown for her 2003 New York appearances with conductor Lorin Maazel at both Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall.</p><p>Fischer was born in 1983, in Munich, Germany. She began taking lessons on the violin at age 3 from Helge Thelen, and at 4 began simultaneous studies on the piano with her mother, Viera Fischer, a talented amateur pianist. Young Julia's first advanced studies on the violin came a few years later in Augsburg, at the Leopold Mozart Conservatory; at 9, she began taking instruction at the Munich Academy of Music. Among her most important teachers there has been violin virtuoso Ana Chumachenco.</p><p>In 1995 Fischer won first prize at the International Yehudi Menuhin Competition, where she also captured a special prize for best performance of a J.S. Bach solo work. The following year, in Lisbon, she won first prize at the Eurovision Competition for Young Instrumentalists, an event broadcast widely throughout Europe. Other important prizes followed as Fischer steadily developed her career as an orchestral soloist and recitalist.</p><p>She gave regular concerts with major symphony orchestras beginning in the late '90s in both Europe and the United States. 2003 was a pivotal year in her career: in the aforementioned concerts with Lorin Maazel, where she played the Sibelius Violin Concerto with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra at Avery Fisher Hall and the Brahms Double Concerto with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and cellist Han-Na Chang at Carnegie Hall, she convincingly established her credentials as one of the most talented violinists of her generation.</p><p>Thereafter she made concert tours with many of the world's finest orchestras, including the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields (under Neville Marriner), the Gewandhaus Orchestra (Herbert Blomstedt), and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Her first major recording was a 2001 DVD of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons, with Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. In 2004 she began recording exclusively for PentaTone Classics, her first disc featuring performances of the Prokofiev First Violin Concerto, as well as Khachaturian and Glazunov concertos. Subsequent recordings include a disc of solo works by J.S. Bach and a CD of Brahms' chamber music.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Robert CummingsM</b></p>",

		"biography": "<p>While most bands undergo a number of changes over the course of their careers, few groups experienced such radical stylistic changes as Fleetwood Mac. Initially conceived as a hard-edged British blues combo in the late '60s, the band gradually evolved into a polished pop/rock act over the course of a decade. Throughout all of their incarnations, the only consistent members of Fleetwood Mac were drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie -- the rhythm section that provided the band with its name. Ironically, they had the least influence over the musical direction of the band. Originally, guitarists Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer provided the band with its gutsy, neo-psychedelic blues-rock sound, but as both guitarists descended into mental illness, the group began moving toward pop/rock with the songwriting of pianist Christine McVie. By the mid-'70s, Fleetwood Mac had relocated to California, where they added the soft rock duo of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks to their lineup. Obsessed with the meticulously arranged pop of the Beach Boys and the Beatles, Buckingham helped the band become one of the most popular groups of the late '70s. Combining soft rock with the confessional introspection of singer/songwriters, Fleetwood Mac created a slick but emotional sound that helped 1977's Rumours become one of the biggest-selling albums of all time. The band retained its popularity through the early '80s, when Buckingham, Nicks, and Christine McVie all began pursuing solo careers. The band reunited for one album, 1987's Tango in the Night, before splintering in the late '80s. Buckingham left the group initially, but the band decided to soldier on, releasing one other album before Nicks and McVie left the band in the early '90s, hastening the group's commercial decline.</p><p>The roots of Fleetwood Mac lie in John Mayall's legendary British blues outfit, the Bluesbreakers. Bassist John McVie was one of the charter members of the Bluesbreakers, joining the group in 1963. In 1966 Peter Green replaced Eric Clapton, and a year later drummer Mick Fleetwood joined. Inspired by the success of Cream, the Yardbirds, and Jimi Hendrix, the trio decided to break away from Mayall in 1967. At their debut at the British Jazz and Blues Festival in August, Bob Brunning was playing bass in the group, since McVie was still under contract to Mayall. He joined the band a few weeks after their debut; by that time, slide guitarist Jeremy Spencer had joined the band. Fleetwood Mac soon signed with Blue Horizon, releasing their eponymous debut the following year. Fleetwood Mac was an enormous hit in the U.K., spending over a year in the Top Ten. Despite its British success, the album was virtually ignored in America. During 1968, the band added guitarist Danny Kirwan. The following year, they recorded Fleetwood Mac in Chicago with a variety of bluesmen, including Willie Dixon and Otis Spann. The set was released later that year, after the band had left Blue Horizon for a one-album deal with Immediate Records; in the U.S., they signed with Reprise/Warner Bros., and by 1970, Warner began releasing the band's British records as well.</p><p>Fleetwood Mac released English Rose and Then Play On during 1969, which both indicated that the band was expanding its music, moving away from its blues purist roots. That year, Peter Green's ~Man of the World~ and ~Oh Well~ were number two hits. Though his music was providing the backbone of the group, Green was growing increasingly disturbed due to his large ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs. After announcing that he was planning to give all of his earnings away, Green suddenly left the band in the spring of 1970; he released two solo albums over the course of the '70s, but he rarely performed after leaving Fleetwood Mac. The band replaced him with Christine Perfect, a vocalist/pianist who had earned a small but loyal following in the U.K. by singing with Spencer Davis and the Chicken Shack. She had already performed uncredited on Then Play On. Contractual difficulties prevented her from becoming a full-fledged member of Fleetwood Mac until 1971; by that time she had married John McVie.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>",

The raw groove of one of Green's most famous compositions, ~Black Magic Woman,~ the beautiful atmospherics of ~Albatross,~ and the shuffling cover of the Howlin' Wolf tune ~No Place to Go~ certainly highlight the early days of Fleetwood Mac and serve to document a fascinating group who commanded as much importance in the British psychedelic blues scene as much as the American pop scene.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Gregory McIntosh</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>This Peter Green-led edition of the Mac isn't just an important transition between their initial blues-based incarnation and the mega-pop band they became, it's also their most vital, exciting version. The addition of Danny Kirwan as second guitarist and songwriter foreshadows not only the soft-rock terrain of ~Bare Trees~ and ~Kiln House~ with Christine Perfect-McVie, but also predicts Rumours. That only pertains to roughly half of the also excellent material here, though; the rest is quintessential Green. The immortal ~Oh Well,~ with its hard-edged, thickly layered guitars and chamber-like sections, is perhaps the band's most enduring progressive composition. ~Rattlesnake Shake~ is another familiar number, a down-and-dirty, even-paced funk, with clean, wall-of-sound guitars. Choogling drums and Green's fiery improvisations power ~Searching for Madge,~ perhaps Mac's most inspired work save ~Green Manalishi,~ and leads into an unlikely symphonic interlude and the similar, lighter boogie ~Fighting for Madge.~ A hot Afro-Cuban rhythm with beautiful guitars from Kirwan and Green on ~Coming Your Way~ not only defines the Mac's sound, but the rock aesthetic of the day. Of the songs with Kirwan's stamp on them, ~Closing My Eyes~ is a mysterious waltz love song; haunting guitars approach surf music on the instrumental ~My Dream~; while ~Although the Sun Is Shining~ is the ultimate pre-Rumours number someone should revisit. Blues roots still crop up on the spatial, loose, Hendrix-tinged ~Underway,~ the folky ~Like Crying,~ and the final outcry of the ever-poignant ~Show Biz Blues,~ with Green moaning ~do you really give a damn for me?~ Then Play On is a reminder of how pervasive and powerful Green's influence was on Mac's originality and individual stance beyond his involvement. Still highly recommended and a must-buy after all these years, it remains their magnum opus.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Michael G. Nastos</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>As far as odds and ends packages go, Original Fleetwood Mac (1971) is an undeniably strong collection culled primarily from the band's first incarnation, featuring John McVie (bass/guitar), Mick Fleetwood (drums), Peter Green (guitar/vocals), and Jeremy Spencer (guitar/piano/vocals). As evidenced by the material, this quartet are an unmistakably blues-based combo. Early on they distinguished themselves as not only interpreters of traditional fare, but skilled composers, especially Green, who penned the vast majority of these selections. While their entire output during this era can be found on the six-disc Complete Blue Horizon Sessions: 1967-1969 (1999), the best of those secondary sides are contained within this disc. Green's total envelopment of the blues, coupled with equally inspired guitar craft, illuminate the traditional ~Drifting~ and ~First Train Home,~ as well as an adventurous, hopped-up cover of Muddy Waters' ~Rollin' and Tumblin',~ titled ~Rambling Pony No. 2.~ ~Watch Out~ reveals Fleetwood Mac's decidedly jazzier visage. While the driving upbeat rhythm is deeply rooted in a Chicago-style delivery, Green's fretwork is undeniably fresh, giving the outing fuel for the combo's fiery contributions. ~A Fool No More~ is another notable variation and possible harbinger of their later psychedelic ventures. The instrumental ~Fleetwood Mac~ sounds as if it may have been taken from a jam session already in progress. The adaptation of Arthur ~Big Boy~ Crudup's ~Mean Old Fireman~ offers an acoustic pseudo-slide lead from Green, but ultimately it fails to truly ignite. B.B. King's ~Worried Dream~ is an interesting choice that would show up later in the band's concurrent concert repertoire.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

At 18, he moved to San Francisco to form the Charles Ford Band (named after his father, who was also a guitarist) and was soon hired to play with Charles Musselwhite for nine months. In 1971, the Charles Ford Blues Band was re-formed and recorded for Arhoolie in early 1972. Ford played with Jimmy Witherspoon (1972-1973), the L.A. Express with Tom Scott (1974), George Harrison, and Joni Mitchell. In 1977, he was a founding member of the Yellowjackets, which he stayed with until 1983, simultaneously having a solo career and working as a session guitarist. In 1986, Ford toured with Miles Davis and he had two separate periods (1985 and 1987) with Sadao Watanabe, but he seemed to really find himself in 1992 when he returned to his roots: the blues. Ford formed a new group, the Blue Line, and has since recorded a couple of blues-rock dates for Stretch that are among the finest of his career.

Although nearly all of the songs can be found on other Ford albums (most are from Handful of Blues), one of the things that makes this jazzy recording so special is that Ford is playing only an acoustic guitar. The Ray Charles gem ~Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying~ (which you WON'T find elsewhere) is simply beautiful, and on Paul Butterfield's ~Lovin' Cup,~ it's just Ford and his guitar. The brilliance of his playing and the reason behind why so many guitar players put him at the top of their list can be found in Ford's performance on this release, alternating between lead and rhythm. The Authorized Bootleg also has great (albeit laid-back) versions of ~When I Leave Here~ and ~Tired of Talkin'.~ Highly, highly recommended.</p>&mdash; <b>Ann Wickstrom</b>"

		"name": "Bill Frisell",
		"biography": "<p>The defining characteristic of any given jazz musician is frequently his sound. The more control a player has over the nature of that sound, the more likely he is to project a distinctive musical personality. For example, a saxophonist has virtually unlimited physical control of the sound that comes through his horn, and therefore a wide range of tonal expression at his command -- which partially explains the disproportionate number of saxophonists in the pantheon of great jazz musicians. On the other hand, few electric guitarists inhabit that realm, in part because the typical jazz guitar sound differs little from player to player. In general, guitarists do not have the same degree of physical control. Without the use of signal processing -- which jazz purists shun -- they're mostly stuck with the generic sound that comes out of their amp. Hence, guitarists have historically tended to ~sound~ more or less the same.</p><p>Bill Frisell is a notable exception. Among jazz guitarists, Frisell is unique in his exploitation of variable timbre. Frisell's sound swells and breathes like a saxophonist's (interestingly, Frisell played clarinet as a child). In many ways his sound is reminiscent of a pedal steel guitar. And although his work is steeped in jazz, Frisell is a man of catholic tastes. His music includes characteristics of rock, country, and bluegrass, among various other styles. Such liberality explains his willingness to expand his tonal palette beyond that of the typical jazz guitarist. Where so many conventional jazz guitarists define themselves by how many notes they can play, Frisell has carved a niche by virtue of his sound. His ability as an original, lyrical player of melody combines with a unique (if much imitated) sound to make him one of the most singular musicians of his generation.</p><p>Born in Baltimore, Frisell grew up in Denver, CO. He began playing the clarinet in the fourth grade. Frisell took up guitar a few years later for his personal amusement. He continued with the clarinet, playing in school concert and marching bands. Frisell briefly considered playing classical clarinet professionally. He played guitar in rock and R&B bands as a teenager (high school classmates included Philip Bailey, Andrew Woolfork, and Larry Dunn, future members of the funk group Earth, Wind, and Fire). He discovered jazz in the music of Wes Montgomery, and began to study the music. Dale Bruning, a Denver-based guitarist and educator, fed his fascination with jazz. Frisell decided to make guitar his primary instrument. After briefly attending the University of Northern Colorado, he moved to Boston in 1971 to attend the Berklee School of Music. There he studied with Michael Gibbs and John Damian. While at Berklee, Frisell connected with other like-minded players (Pat Metheny was a classmate). He also studied with Jim Hall, who became an important influence, especially in terms of harmony. In the mid-'70s, Frisell began moving away from pure bebop and began fusing jazz with his other musical interests. At about this time he began developing his atmospheric, quasi-mictrotonal style. He discovered that, by using a guitar with a flexible neck, he could manipulate the instrument's intonation. A combination of experimental techniques and signal processors like delay and reverb gave Frisell a sound unlike any other guitarist. In the late '70s he traveled to Belgium. There he met Manfred Eicher, the founder of ECM Records. Beginning in the early '80s, Frisell recorded prolifically for the label, as leader and sideman with such musicians as Paul Motian and Jan Garbarek. He continued with the label throughout the decade, earning a reputation as ECM's ~house guitarist.~ Frisell became much acclaimed by critics for his sophisticated yet accessible work. Frisell moved to New York in the '80s, where he worked with many of the most creative musicians active on the city's ~downtown~ jazz scene. In the '80s and '90s he would record and perform with a huge variety of artists, not all of them jazz musicians. Collaborators would include rock and pop musicians (drummer Ginger Baker, singers Marianne Faithfull and Elvis Costello), experimental jazz musicians (saxophonist/composers John Zorn and Tim Berne), and at least one classical composer (Gavin Bryars). Frisell composed soundtracks for the silent films of Buster Keaton. His 1996 album Quartet won the Deutsche Schallplattenpreis, the German equivalent of the Grammy. Frisell became an annual winner of various magazine polls for his solo work and recordings. By the end of the '90s, Frisell was one of the most well-known jazz musicians in the world, with an audience and an aesthetic that transcended the boundaries of any given style. It should be mentioned that, while Frisell is best known for his somewhat ~ambient~ guitar technique, he is a swinging, harmonically fluent jazz player when the occasion warrants. Frisell moved to Seattle, WA, in 1989, where he lives as of this writing.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Chris Kelsey</strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>Bill Frisell has been actively &mdash; some would say obsessively &mdash; exploring the depths and dimensions of American roots music since the release of Nashville in 1997. His subsequent recordings &mdash; Ghost Town, Gone Just Like a Train, Blues Dream, Good Dog, Happy Man, and The Willies &mdash; were all approaches to the various folk styles that originated on American soil: country, blues, bluegrass, field hollers, jazz, and others. He has successfully been able to blend, extract, adapt, and otherwise morph one set of music onto another through his own approach to guitar playing &mdash; the song. More than any other contemporary guitarist, Frisell is driven by the notion of song &mdash; what it entails, both in terms of musical and cultural expression, and what it implies. On The Intercontinentals, Frisell continues his investigation of American music, but as a way of understanding how it entwines with the folk musics of other nations. Onboard for this outing are Frisell's longtime collaborators Jenny Scheinman; pedal, dobro, and lap steel guitarist Greg Leisz; as well as Brazilian mega-guitarist and songwriter Vinicius Cantuaria; Greek-Macedonian vocalist and oud player Christos Govetas and Malian percussionist and vocalist Sidikki Camara. Frisell had played with Camara and Malian uber-guitarist Boubacar Traore a couple of years before and was intrigued enough to explore the connection further. The result of this unlikely union is one of the most seamlessly beautiful works Frisell has ever produced. On it, he and Cantuaria delve into the modern Malian guitar and percussion sound pioneered by Ali Farka Toure; blend it with the timeless emotional resonance of Greek folk songs via Govetas' oud and infectious Brazilian lyricism; and filter it through shimmering country landscapes and otherworldly string textures that reinvent harmonic properties to suit the lyric of the blues, song, indigenous folk musics, and the contemporary improvisational ideal.</p><p>Frisell composed the lion's share of the tunes here, but there are also contributions by Gilberto Gil, Traore, Govetas, and Cantuaria. Scheinman's violin acts as a gorgeous signpost for virtually all of these musicians to return to; her melodic sensibility and crisp tone are beacons in the often swirling, escalating, and/or cascading whorls of plucked strings, playing as many as four melodies simultaneously with winding, almost knotty scalar interchanges. What is most fascinating is that even in the vocal tunes, or those where the Malian blues effect is the prominent force, everything else in the mix fans out and creates often contrapuntal backdrops for elegant and lush, if dense, textures. Simply put, this is the busiest record Frisell has made in years, but it doesn't feel like it. His sense of ~song~ is so pervasive, everything here is arranged to fit its ~singing.~ His own tone is unmistakable, as is Leisz's and Cantuaria's. The guitars are as distinct as the oud and the violin, all of them carried into the next space by hand drums. While each song does stand on its own as a harmonic and lyrical entity, with adventurous improvisation added in the spirit of true exploration, as an album they are linked by the weave of aural tapestry, dynamics, and spaciousness that is so central to Frisell's sound. And while this is more collaborative than perhaps anything he's done in a decade, it nonetheless bears his sonic and esthetic imprint. This is a remarkable album; its sets a new watermark for Frisell's sense of adventure and taste, and displays his perception of beauty in a pronounced, uncompromising, yet wholly accessible way.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Bill Frisell is a jazz guitarist primarily by virtue of the influence of jazz guitar virtuoso Jim Hall; otherwise, Frisell is an amazing amalgam of stylistic influences that make him something of the Cassandra Wilson of the guitar. Melding ambient soundscapes, the twang of country music, the wide-open chords of pure Americana, and the bluesy electric sculptures of Jimi Hendrix, Frisell is one of the most original guitarists to come down the pike in a long time.</p><p>On this recording, Frisell has surrounded himself with an auspicious jazz-based rhythm section consisting of powerful, innovative drummer Elvin Jones and bassist/composer/arranger Dave Holland. That both of these musicians have played in settings as varied as those in which Frisell has found himself promises a brilliant recording on paper, and this is one of those times when that promise is fulfilled in the actual recording.</p><p>The genre bending is present from the start, with the opening “Outlaws,” which morphs from a jangly guitar intro to a bluesy, discordant jazz piece to an open, swaggering shuffle. Jones shines, both defining and pushing the beat, while Frisell offers a virtual history of jazz and blues guitar influences. At the same time that he is playing what amounts to hard bop, he is delving into the Hendrix-by-way-of-Wes-Montgomery grab bag, and the trio swings as hard as any in recent memory. Dave Holland caps the opener off with a wonderfully melodic bass solo. “Twenty Years” is a waltz that allows all three players to demonstrate their mastery of space, with understatement being the key element. “Coffaro’s Theme” combines a folky sound with some ambient washes, with Frisell’s trademark pedals, loops, and tape effects sounding like an organic part of the mix. “Blues Dream” is indeed both bluesy and dreamy, with a late night feel and a few harmonic elements that hint at a more foreign locale than most of the tracks on the album.</p><p>If Frisell sometimes seems to mine the same Americana-laden sound as John Fahey, he does it with fewer nods at virtuosity and a more direct approach. His cover of Stephen Foster’s “Hard Times” is much looser, giving a jamboree jam approach to the piece that belies its lyrics, which are not heard here. While a bit more languid than one might expect to hear from guitarists of Foster’s time, the arrangement and overall feel convey the composition’s wistful, hopeful melancholy very well. The trio’s rendition of “Moon River” is simply gorgeous, stripping the song of its Breakfast at Tiffany’s association and portraying it as a beautiful melody with sophisticated harmonic underpinnings. Jones offers some stunning brushwork, and Holland’s support for Frisell’s solo flights are perfect.</p><p>One cannot help comparing this group with John Abercrombie’s Gateway trio, featuring Abercrombie on guitar, Holland on bass, and Jack DeJohnette on drums. That group has recorded four albums over a period of more than fifteen years, and I’d love to think that Frisell might find the results of this outing fascinating enough to repeat the experience periodically, though the chances of that are probably slim. Like the Gateway group, this trio demonstrates an amazing level of interplay, with Holland and Jones well able to get inside Frisell’s mind and offer not only support, but also real interaction and subtle colorations. I find it easy to imagine those who like to listen to more adventurous and improvisational rock-oriented guitarists loving this album as much as jazzheads. One of the elements of the Gateway group that was intriguing was its ability to do extended group improvisations that were musically successful, like some kind of jazzy Grateful Dead. Frisell, Holland, and Jones could no doubt provide some intriguing results with group improvisation as well. How about it, guys? If not, at least we have this album to enjoy, and if you enjoy guitar improvisation by a master musician, it comes highly recommended.</p>"

				"review": "<p>The allusion of the title East/West is an apt one; this live double-CD set is a study in contrasts. Recorded just six months apart with two different trios, Bill Frisell really shows both sides of his musical personality. The ~East~ disc was recorded in December of 2003 at the Village Vanguard with Frisell on guitar (acoustic and electric) and loops, Tony Sherr on acoustic bass and a bit of acoustic guitar, and Kenny Wollesen on drums and percussion. The program here consists largely of well-known standards with a couple brief improvisations and a single Frisell composition. The ~West~ disc was recorded at Yoshi's in May of 2004 and features Frisell (guitars, loops), Viktor Krauss (acoustic bass), and, well, Kenny Wollesen on drums (no other percussion), but this time the program is half Frisell compositions, a couple pop songs, and the traditional ~Shenandoah.~ On the ~East~ disc, only three of the ten tunes are longer than five minutes, but on the ~West~ disc only one track is shorter than eight minutes! The preponderance of standards on the ~West~ disc keeps the players mostly on the inside tip, even eliciting laughter from some audience members when Frisell hits the intro to the old warhorse ~People~ (to which he replies, ~you think I'm joking or what?~). They do loosen up a bit at the end, for a wonderful arrangement of Willie Nelson's ~Crazy~ with two acoustic guitars and looping aural detritus, and there's a fun gallop through ~Tennessee Flat Top Box.~ The group improvisations also add a bit of spark. Folks who discovered Frisell in the late '90s with albums like Nashville are going to love this set.</p><p>Then there are the folks who discovered Frisell in the '80s as a major player in the downtown new music scene along with folks like John Zorn and Wayne Horvitz (fellow bandmates in the groundbreaking and genre-smashing Naked City band). For them, Frisell seemed to be losing his edge a bit as his trademark skronk was traded for acoustic textures. Richter 858 and the Grammy-winning (!) Unspeakable saw him revisiting that earlier sound to some degree, mainly through more extensive use of delays and loops, but the ~West~ disc here shows he's really back. ~Heard It Through the Grapevine~ starts out a bit slow, but right from the outset the delay plays a large role, ping-ponging ugly harmonics back and forth as an intro before hitting the first verse. It gradually picks up momentum, until the delays return and Frisell adopts a roaring backward-sounding tone for the end. ~Blues for Los Angeles~ has even more great looping, some pretty menacing sounds, and some fantastic soloing. ~Pipe Down~ (originally on Nashville) gets a much slower deconstructed treatment, then kicks into high gear with a serious groove. This set is way more adventurous than the ~East~ one, and might surprise some old fans who haven't been paying close attention of late. Frisell retreats a bit from the edge for the last track, a nice reading of ~A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall~ where the delay plays little to no role. With both bands, the rhythm section offers great support, but interestingly, Tony Scherr gets a bit of solo space while Viktor Krauss gets none. Then there's the fact that the album is called East/West, but the ~West~ disc (the later of the dates) is programmed as the first disc, so you listen to the sets in reverse chronological order as well as the opposite of what the title implies (perhaps ~West/East~ would have been more appropriate). And while this set is indeed a study in contrast, the common thread is the absolute guitar mastery and singular style and tone of Frisell. His use of double stops, open string voicings, and chordal leads in his playing, not to mention that slippery tone, makes him one of the most recognizable voices in music no matter what the context. And it's clear that Frisell is at home in any context, from playing chestnuts like ~The Days of Wine and Roses~ to John Zorn speed metal. The fairly naked trio context of East/West really gives the listener a chance to appreciate exactly what he can do, no matter which musical direction they're coming from.</p>&mdash; <b>Sean Westergaard</b>"

Neverthless, he was one of the most recorded artists of his time and by far the most popular and influential Piedmont blues player of all time. Fuller could play in multiple styles: slide, ragtime, pop, and blues were all enhanced by his National steel guitar. Fuller worked with some fine sidemen, including Davis, Sonny Terry, and washboard player Bull City Red. Initially discovered and promoted by Carolina entrepreneur H. B. Long, Fuller recorded for ARC and Decca. He also served as a conduit to recording sessions, steering fellow blues musicians to the studio.</p><p>In spite of Fuller's recorded output, most of his musical life was spent as a street musician and house party favorite, and he possessed the skills to reinterpret and cover the hits of other artists as well. In this sense, he was a synthesizer of styles, parallel in many ways to <a href=~/cg/x.dll?p=amg&sql=B91178~>Robert Johnson</a>, his contemporary who died three years earlier. Like Johnson, Fuller lived fast and died young in 1942, only 33 years old. Fuller was a fine, expressive vocalist and a masterful guitar player best remembered for his uptempo ragtime hits ~Rag Mama Rag,~ ~Trucking My Blues Away,~ and ~Step It Up and Go.~ At the same time he was capable of deeper material, and his versions of ~Lost Lover Blues~ or ~Mamie~ are as deep as most Delta blues. Because of his popularity, he may have been overexposed on records, yet most of his songs remained close to tradition and much of his repertoire and style is kept alive by North Carolina and Virginia artists today.</p> <p><b> Barry Lee Pearson, All Music Guide</b></p>",

		"biography": "<div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/pg-security.jpg~ alt=~Security~><p>As the leader of Genesis in the early '70s, Peter Gabriel helped move progressive rock to new levels of theatricality. He was no less ambitious as a solo artist, but he was more subtle in his methods. With his first eponymous solo album in 1977, he began exploring darker, more cerebral territory, incorporating avant-garde, electronic, and worldbeat influences into his music. The record, as well as its two similarly titled successors, established Gabriel as a critically acclaimed cult artist, and with 1982's Security, he began to move into the mainstream; ~Shock the Monkey~ became his first Top 40 hit, paving the way for his multi-platinum breakthrough So in 1986. Accompanied by a series of groundbreaking videos and the number one single ~Sledgehammer,~ So became a multi-platinum hit, and Gabriel became an international star. Instead of capitalizing on his sudden success, he began to explore other interests, including recording soundtracks and running his company Real World. By the time he returned to pop with 1992's Us, his mass audience had faded away and he spent the remainder of the '90s working on multimedia projects for Real World.</p><p>Following his departure from Genesis in 1976, Peter Gabriel began work on the first of three consecutive eponymously titled albums; each record was named Peter Gabriel, he said, as if they were editions of the same magazine. In 1977, his first solo album appeared and became a moderate success due to the single ~Solsbury Hill.~ Another self-titled record followed in 1978, yet received comparatively weaker reviews. Gabriel's third eponymous album proved to be his artistic breakthrough, however. Produced by Steve Lillywhite and released in 1980, the album established Gabriel as one of rock's most ambitious, innovative musicians, as well as one of its most political -- ~Biko,~ a song about a murdered anti-apartheid activist, became one of the biggest protest anthems of the '80s. ~Games Without Frontiers,~ with its eerie chorus, nearly reached the Top 40.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/pg-birdy.jpg~ alt=~Birdy~><p>In 1982, Gabriel released Security, which was an even bigger success, earning positive reviews and going gold on the strength of the startling video for ~Shock the Monkey.~ Just as his solo career was taking off, Gabriel participated in a one-shot Genesis reunion in order to finance his WOMAD -- World of Music, Arts and Dance -- Festival. WOMAD was designed to bring various world musics and customs to a Western audience, and it soon turned into an annual event, and a live double album was released that year to commemorate the event. As Gabriel worked on his fifth album, he contributed the soundtrack to Alan Parker's 1984 film Birdy. His score was highly praised and it won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes that year. After founding Real World, Inc. -- a corporation devoted to developing bridges between technology and multi-ethnic arts -- in 1985, he completed his fifth album, So.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/pg-passion.jpg~ alt=~Passion~><p>Released in 1986, So became Gabriel's commercial breakthrough, largely because his Stax homage ~Sledgehammer~ was blessed with an innovative video that combined stop-action animation with live action. So climbed to number two as ~Sledgehammer~ hit number one, with ~Big Time~ -- featuring a video very similar to ~Sledgehammer~ -- reaching the Top Ten and ~In Your Eyes~ hitting the Top 30. As So was riding high on the American and British charts, Gabriel co-headlined the first benefit tour for Amnesty International in 1986 with Sting and U2. Another Amnesty International Tour followed in 1988, and the following year, Gabriel released Passion: Music for The Last Temptation of Christ, a collection of instrumentals used in Martin Scorsese's film. Passion was the furthest Gabriel delved into worldbeat, and the album was widely acclaimed, winning the Grammy Award in 1989 for Best New Age Performance. In 1990, he released the hits compilation Shaking the Tree.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/pg-secret-world.jpg~ alt=~Secret World Live~><p>Gabriel labored long on the pop music follow-up to So, finally releasing Us in the spring of 1992. During the recording of Us, Gabriel went through a number of personal upheavals, including a painful divorce, and those tensions manifested themselves on Us, a much darker record than So. For various reasons, not the least of which was the fact that it was released six years after its predecessor, Us wasn't as commercially successful as So, despite positive reviews. Only one single, the ~Sledgehammer~ knockoff ~Steam,~ reached the Top 40, and the album stalled at platinum sales. In 1993, Gabriel embarked on the most ambitious WOMAD tour to date, touring the United States with a roster including Crowded House, James, and Sinéad O'Connor, with whom he had an on-off romantic relationship. The following year, he released the double-disc Secret World Live, which went gold. Later in 1994, he released the CD-ROM Xplora, one of many projects he developed with Real World. For the rest of the decade, Gabriel concentrated on developing more multimedia projects for the company and working on a new studio album.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/pg-up.jpg~ alt=~Up~><p>Up was released in 2002, a full decade after Gabriel's last studio effort. Dense, cerebral, and often difficult, the record peaked at number nine but failed to sell well in America. It fared slightly better in Canada, where it went gold. He then turned his attention to a host of different projects, although the release of Big Blue Ball -- a compilation of collaborative performances recorded at Real World Studios during the '90s -- helped placate fans while Gabriel focused his energies elsewhere. He eventually returned to the studio for another album, 2010's Scratch My Back, which featured orchestral covers of songs originally performed by Radiohead, Arcade Fire, Paul Simon, David Bowie, and others. Gabriel uncharacteristically delivered the sequel to Scratch My Back quickly, releasing New Blood -- a collection of orchestral reinterpretations of his own songs -- in the fall of 2011. The following year, Gabriel held a lavish celebration of the 25th anniversary of So, releasing several deluxe editions of the record -- the largest being a four-CD, two-DVD, two-vinyl box -- and launching the Back to Front tour, where he played So in its entirety. In 2014, Gabriel was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a solo act, joining Genesis, which had been inducted four years earlier.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>",

Majestically opening with an acoustic guitar, the song finds Gabriel's talents gelling, as the words and music feed off each other, turning into true poetry. It stands out dramatically on this record, not because the music doesn't work, but because it brilliantly illustrates why Gabriel had to fly on his own. Though this is undeniably the work of the same man behind The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, he's turned his artiness inward, making his music coiled, dense, vibrant. There is still some excess, naturally, yet it's the sound of a musician unleashed, finally able to bend the rules as he wishes. That means there are less atmospheric instrumental sections, as there were on his last few records with Genesis, but unhinged bizarreness in the arrangements, compositions, and productions, as the opener ~Morbund the Burgermeister~ vividly illustrates. He also has turned sleeker, sexier, capable of turning out a surging rocker of ~Modern Love.~ If there is any problem with Peter Gabriel, it's that Gabriel is trying too hard to show the range of his talents, thereby stumbling occasionally with the doo wop-to-cabaret ~Excuse Me~ or the cocktail jazz of ~Waiting for the Big One~ (or, the lyric ~you've got me cookin'/I'm a hard-boiled egg~ on ~Humdrum~). Still, much of the record teems with invigorating energy (as on ~Slowburn,~ or the orchestral-disco pulse of ~Down the Dolce Vita~), and the closer ~Here Comes the Flood~ burns with an anthemic intensity that would later become his signature in the '80s. Yes, it's an imperfect album, but that's a byproduct of Gabriel's welcome risk-taking — the very thing that makes the album work, overall.</P><P>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B></P>"

Though these performances aren't as fearless as the ones that accompanied his first solo tours, they are surging and tight. Gabriel is a consummate performer and even if the tapes were slightly cleaned up in the studio, his passion is apparent throughout the record. It's a very good live album, but it really is only necessary for die-hard fans. [In 2002, Universal released a 12 song ~highlights~ disc.]</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Although he had thrived on live performance as a member of Genesis, Peter Gabriel waited until he was four albums and six years deep into his solo career -- with the hit album Security and the Top 40 ~Shock the Monkey~ chalked up to his credit -- before he took the plunge into concert recording with this album. Released as a double-LP and two-CD set (but also later in a single CD ~highlights~ edition, missing four songs), this is a fine summing up of the artist's early solo years. Most of his biggest hits and key album tracks are represented in tight, inspired performances -- the notes concede that some of what is here was sweetened after the fact in the studio, but the immediacy of the stage performances wasn't lost in the process, and that emotional edge and intimacy give songs such as ~Solsbury Hill,~ ~I Don't Remember,~ and ~Shock the Monkey~ a sharper, deeper resonance than their studio renditions, fine as those are. It's that side of the performance that makes this release well worth owning, for anyone enamored of Gabriel's voice or songs, even if nothing here wholly supplants the studio originals. And the band -- Tony Levin (bass, stick, backing vocals), Jerry Marotta (drums, vocals), David Rhodes (guitar, vocals), and Larry Fast (keyboards) -- is in excellent form as well. What is lacking is the cohesiveness that one might have gotten from a live album assembled from a single concert; derived from a multitude of shows, the individual songs are excellent unto themselves, but there's little sense (or even the illusion) from song to song of any forward momentum across the album, and that might be the one major flaw here. But this is a suitable capstone to the first phase of Gabriel's solo career, and also a peculiar one in certain respects -- given the effort that obviously went into assembling the album, the packaging is almost minimalist by the standards of live albums and double albums of the era (the LP version even put both platters into a single sleeve).</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

Needless to say, it was also his most accessible, and, in that sense it was a good introduction to So, the catchiest, happiest record he ever cut. ~Sledgehammer~ propelled the record toward blockbuster status, and Gabriel had enough songs with single potential to keep it there. There was ~Big Time,~ another colorful dance number; ~Don't Give Up,~ a moving duet with Kate Bush; ~Red Rain,~ a stately anthem popular on album rock radio; and ~In Your Eyes,~ Gabriel's greatest love song, which achieved genuine classic status after being featured in Cameron Crowe's classic Say Anything. These all illustrated the strengths of the album: Gabriel's increased melodicism and ability to blend African music, jangly pop, and soul into his moody art rock. Apart from these singles, plus the urgent ~That Voice Again,~ the rest of the record is as quiet as the album tracks of Security. The difference is, the singles on that record were part of the overall fabric; here, the singles are the fabric, which can make the album seem top-heavy (a fault of many blockbuster albums, particularly those of the mid-'80s). Even so, those songs are so strong, finding Gabriel in a newfound confidence and accessibility, that it's hard not to be won over by them, even if So doesn't develop the unity of its two predecessors.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Remarkably dramatic, even visual, it is not only Gabriel's best film work but deserving of serious consideration as his finest music of any kind; equally worthwhile is Passion -- Sources, which assembles the original native recordings which served as his creative launching pad.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jason Ankeny</strong></p>"

It's not just that the production is pristine, clean, and immaculate, it's that the music is, with only a handful of exceptions (namely, the ~Sledgehammer~ rewrite ~Steam~ and the fellatio ode ~Kiss That Frog~), remarkably subtle and shaded. It's also not a coincidence that Us is, as Gabriel says in his liner notes, ~about relationships,~ since the exquisitely textured music lets him expose his soul, albeit in a typically obtuse way. Since the music is so muted, it's no surprise that the album failed to capture a mass audience the way So did, but it's foolish to expect anyone but serious fans to unravel an album this deliberate. Gabriel is as adventurous as ever, yet he is relentlessly sober about his experiments, burying exotic sounds and percussion underneath crawling tempos measured atmospherics -- this is tastefully two-toned music, assembled by a consummate craftsman who became too immersed in detail to make anything but an insular, introspective work. Some gems are easier to unearth than others -- ~Digging in the Dirt~ has an insistent pulse, ~Blood of Eden~ and ~Come Talk to Me~ are quite beautiful, ~Secret World~ is quietly anthemic -- yet, given enough time, the record's understated approach and reflection becomes its most attractive element.

OVO is a work based on the intersecting problems of race relations, environmental concerns, family issues, and fairy tales as allegories, violence, and more. And keep in mind that this was to be a visual piece. Gabriel, to meet the challenge for CD, added a ton of multimedia to the musical soundtrack: there is a drawn storybook, The Story of OVO, a view of the installation itself from every angle, and many stopgap notes, drawings, and the like. For the soundtrack, he enlisted the help of collaborators such as Elizabeth Fraser, Neneh Cherry (whatever happened to her third record, the one she did with Tricky?), Richie Havens, the Black Dyke Mills Band, the Electra Strings, Paul Buchanan (of Blue Nile), Adzido, the Dhol Foundation drummers, and Iarla Ó Lionáird from the Afro-Celt Sound System. Needless to say, the music is all over the map, from a rap version of the ~Story of Ovo~ to an Irish jig to Gabriel's percussive culture plundering soundscapes and new songs (including a truly dull rework of ~Digging in the Dirt~) to Eno-like ambiences to folk songs and new songs with Havens and Ó Lionáird singing like the opposite ends of a heavenly choir and Liz Fraser soaring over the Dhol Foundation drummers. It sounds awesome doesn't it? It should be. But it's not. OVO sounds labored, choppy, and pasted together, like it is the soundtrack to a visual installation, and feels incomplete without it. This is not a project like Passion was or even Birdy; it's a pastiche that attempts to be as ambitious as the installation project. And it is ambitious. Unfortunately, musically it isn't consistent enough to sustain the listener's interest for the entire length of the recording. It is a curious project with moments, but is most likely for hardcore fans only.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Nearly a full decade after the release of Us, Peter Gabriel finally returned with new music in the summer of 2002 -- but it wasn't a new studio album, it was the soundtrack to Phillip Noyce's return to independent Australian cinema, Rabbit-Proof Fence. The film tells the true story of three Aboriginal girls who make a return to their home after being abducted by the government to serve as domestic help to a white family in 1931; as they make their journey through the Outback to their home, they follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence, which had been constructed to prevent animals deemed agricultural pests -- including rabbits, dingoes, and foxes -- from crossing into Western Australia agricultural lands. This, understandably, is a moody, emotional piece, and Gabriel was an ideal choice for the soundtrack, since he proved with his score for Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ that he could stay faithful to the indigenous music of the region while synthesizing it with his own synth-based art rock, providing a haunting, emotionally resonant soundtrack to the film. He does a similar thing here, using Aboriginal music as a foundation for much of his music, yet winding up with a score that's ultimately closer to Birdy than Passion. That's largely due to its long stretches of moody, spare keyboards, which dominate much of the album. The keyboards are the dominant sound here, not the rhythms, but it all blends together for a very evocative, dark yet hopeful set of music. It's not a splashy comeback, then, but a quiet return to something Gabriel does best -- creating soundscapes that are at once alien and familiar, eerie yet comforting. That he hasn't done this in a while does not diminish the fact that he's created a strong instrumental piece that stands on its own, outside of the film, holding its own with Birdy and Passion. And it only whets the appetite for a full-scale comeback.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Ten years is a long time, especially in pop music, but waiting ten years to deliver an album is a clear sign that you're not all that interested in the pop game anyway. Such is the case with Peter Gabriel, who delivered Up in 2002, a decade after Us and four years after he announced its title. Perhaps appropriately, Up sounds like an album that was ten years in the making, revealing not just its pleasures but its intent very, very slowly. This is not an accessible record, nor is it easy to warm up to, which means that many may dismiss it upon a single listen or two, never giving it the time it demands in order to be understood (it does not help matters that the one attempt at a single is the ham-fisted, wrong-headed trash-TV ~satire~ ~The Barry Williams Show,~ which feels utterly forced and out of place here, as if Geffen was pleading for anything resembling a single to add to the album). Really, there is no other choice for an artist as somber and ambitious as Gabriel to craft an album as dense as Up; those who have waited diligently for ten years would be disappointed with anything less and, frankly, they're the only audience that matters after a decade. And they're not likely to be disappointed, since this album grows stronger, revealing more with each listen. Initially, it seems to simply carry on the calmer, darker recesses of Us, but this is an uncompromising affair, which is to its advantage, since Gabriel delves deeper into darkness, grief, and meditation. It may take a while for him to emerge from the darkness -- there is little of the comfort of a ~Come Talk to Me~ or ~Blood of Eden,~ which are immediately soothing on Us -- but there are glimmers of hope throughout the album, even in its darkest moments. Again, it takes awhile to sort all this out -- to unlock the form of the songs, then their meanings -- and it's such a somber, hushed, insular affair that some dedicated listeners may not bother to spin it the appropriate number of times. But those serious fans who want to spend time with this will find that it does pay back many rewards.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Recorded in May 2003 at a single show in the Round in Milan, Italy, this documents Peter Gabriel's worldwide tour following his Up release. As such, it not surprisingly relies heavily on that disc, with seven of the 17 tracks originating from the album. Only about five tunes in this show can be considered ~hits~ (conspicuously absent is anything from his second and third albums) but most won't miss the many omissions since the performance is so consistently breathtaking. Gabriel is known for his elaborate, high-tech presentations and this certainly has its share of surprises. To reveal them would be unfair, since much of the excitement in watching a Gabriel show is seeing how his stage act -- here modernized for an in-the-round setting -- unfurls and reflects the songs. But suffice it to say, that unless you were there -- and even then -- Gabriel has plenty of tricks up his baggy black sleeves. Although he begins modestly, playing stark piano alone on an empty stage for a moving ~Here Comes the Flood,~ the ever-present and very visible orange-suited crew, which appears and disappears though trap doors in the fake floor, quickly adds the full band. Split screens display these techs looking bored under the stage, preparing for the next song, a video technique that is overused throughout the concert's 2 1/4 hour running time. Otherwise, the camera work is excellent, if a bit hyperactive at times. Vocal overdubs are kept to a minimum and the 5.1 surround mix is astonishingly vibrant and detailed. One new song, ~Animal Nation,~ is played, but it is not one of Gabriel's best and at nearly 15 minutes overstays its welcome. Also, the band introductions, which are chanted by the audience after the tune, might have been fun if you were there, but wear thin quickly. Still, this is a beautifully and imaginatively shot production caught in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Gabriel sounds great, as do the band members, many of whom, like bassist Tony Levin and guitarist David Rhodes, are longtime associates. It's a must for any fan of the British star and a riveting performance even for those unfamiliar with his work.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Hal Horowitz</strong></p>"

The package includes one hour-and-a-half disc of the same band playing much of the same material in supposedly smaller places, and a second documentary disc. The ~unwrapped~ title infers this might be unplugged, but that is not the case. These performances are simply from different, purportedly more intimate venues where Gabriel's legendary large theater theatrics were scaled down. Still, ~intimate~ is a bit of a misnomer, as he was still playing to thousands of people, even on these smaller gigs, and the lights and visuals are far more advanced than most acts ever attain. Most annoying is the editing of the songs on disc one, which cuts between different performances of a single tune being played in a variety of venues. This was not the case with Growing Up Live, which was shot at what seemed to be a single gig in Italy. The effect is unintentionally distracting and detracts from the intensity of the show. Even the inclusion of seven tunes not on the previous DVD, some of them of hits as popular as ~Solsbury Hill,~ ~Games Without Frontiers,~ and ~Biko~ -- all of which sound great -- are marred by the fast-cut editing and the incongruous pieced together approach. Disc two is an hour-and-a-half ~unwrapped~ documentary, produced and directed by Anna Gabriel. This uses the majority of the concert material from disc one, interspersed with frustratingly brief interview segments from Gabriel and the band that on occasion only vaguely relate to the song being played. The trick of projecting some of this footage onto Gabriel's face gets old quickly and having to sit through the same songs again just to see about 15 minutes of not terribly insightful interviews makes this extraneous for all but the most ardent Gabriel fans. The extras on both discs though might be worth the price of the package. You get a terrific version of ~In Your Eyes,~ without the quick cuts, along with ~No Self Control~ from 1988's out of print (as of this DVD's release in 2005) P.O.V. tour documentary. Disc two has three live-in-the-studio tracks of the road band playing ~Darkness,~ ~No Way Out,~ and ~Growing Up,~ along with a pair of tunes from a May 2000 appearance on the BBC show Later...with Jools Holland. All of them are well worth seeing and owning, upping the value of this release considerably. The Surround 5.1/DTS sound on both discs is also a big plus. Still, this a necessary purchase only for those fans who already own Growing Up Live and are willing to spend additional money on product that seems unnecessarily padded and not nearly as classy as has come to be expected from the artist.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Hal Horowitz</strong></p>"

Multiple cameras follow Peter Gabriel as he moves around the stage as well as the different orchestral groups whenever they have prominent solos. During close-ups clarity is very good and during larger shots that capture the entire orchestra there are no serious shadow effects. Furthermore, motion-judder is not a serious issue of concern, while background noise is present only during a few selected shots where the camera captures the heavy red lights from an awkward angle. This being said, the actual camerawork/camera movement isn't overly impressive. The show was apparently filmed in 2D and 3D and there are various light and laser effects that simply look a bit over the top in 2D (see screencapture #2). I have not seen the 3D Blu-ray version of the show and therefore do not know how successful these effects are in 3D, but visually the 2D version is somewhat inconsistent for my taste. I also wasn't overly impressed by the raw footage from the stage camera which Peter Gabriel uses towards the end of the show - the idea is good but the execution isn't convincing. Regardless, there are no purely transfer-specific anomalies to report in this review. (Note: This is a Region-Free Blu-ray disc. Therefore, you will be able to play it on your PS3 or SA regardless of your geographical location).</p><p>There are three audio tracks on this Blu-ray disc: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, English LPCM 2.0, and English Dolby Digital 5.1. I opted for the English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and later on did a few random comparisons with the other two tracks for the purpose of this review.</p><p>The English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track boasts a wide range of nuanced dynamics that handle the new arrangements for Peter Gabriel's songs very well. What impressed me the most was the lush orchestral sound and the prominent solos -- the bassoon and flute solos, in particular, sound as well rounded as the vocals (quite a rarity), while the strings are never overpowering. Surround activity is modest, but frankly, the new orchestral arrangements do not demand anything more than what the lossless 5.1 track delivers. Finally, balance is very good and there are no problematic audio dropouts or sync issues to report in this review.</p><p>The English LPCM 2.0 track is serviceable but lacks the depth and fluidity of the English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track. A lot of the nuanced dynamics mentioned earlier are simply missing. This is fairly easy to hear if one compares ~Biko~ (listen and compare the double bass entry and the bassoon solo that follows) and ~Don't Give Up~. Lastly, I tested only two songs, but as expected, the English Dolby Digital 5.1 track is anemic at best. </p>"

His hard-charging, intensely rhythmic playing style on his 1961 Stratocaster still casts a long shadow over rock & roll: Queen's Brian May imitated not only his playing but his gear early on; he credits Gallagher with the root of his sound. Eric Clapton said it was Gallagher who got him ~back into the blues.~ Johnny Marr acknowledges a great debt as well: After learning how to play the guitarist's classic Deuce album track-for-track at 13, he revealed Gallagher's influence throughout his career. Marr also said that he received mentorship and advice on his conduct on-stage and off. Even U2's the Edge and Slash sing his praises and credit his influence. While Gallagher didn't tour the U.S. very often, he lived on the stages of Europe. But he was well-known on Yankee shores for his marathon-length, no-holds-barred live shows at clubs and theaters across North America. While never a major presence on radio in the United States, Gallagher nonetheless racked up a handful of semi-hit singles with ~Laundromat,~ ~I Walk on Hot Coals,~ ~Shadow Play,~ and ~Philby,~ as well as a slew of acclaimed albums from 1971's Deuce and the remarkable Irish Tour in 1974, through Calling Card in 1976 and Top Priority in 1979. Even after the hits, Gallagher continued to pump out high-quality albums including 1982's Jinx and 1990's Fresh Evidence. Even after his accidental death on an operating table in 1995, Gallagher continued to win over new fans and influence artists of many stripes, including the mystery writer Ian Rankin, who created a posthumous compilation called The Continental Op in 2013 comprised of the guitarist's many songs about spies and suspense.</p><p>Gallagher was born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, Irish Republic, on March 2, 1948. Shortly after his birth, his family moved to Cork City in the south, and at age nine he became fascinated with American blues and folk singers he heard on the radio. An avid record collector, he had a wide range of influences, including Leadbelly, Buddy Guy, Freddie King, Albert King, Muddy Waters, and John Lee Hooker. Gallagher would always try to mix some simple country blues songs into his recordings.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/rg-rory-gallagher.jpg~ alt=~Rory Gallagher~/><p>He began his recording career after moving to London, when he formed a trio called Taste. The group's self-titled debut album was released in 1969 in England and later picked up for U.S. distribution by Atco/Atlantic. Between 1969 and 1971, with producer Tony Colton behind the board, Gallagher recorded three albums with Taste before they split up. He began performing under his own name in 1971, releasing his 1970 debut, Rory Gallagher, for Polydor Records in the U.K. The album was picked up for U.S. distribution by Atlantic, and later that year he recorded Deuce, also released by Atlantic in the U.S.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/rg-live-in-europe.jpg~ alt=~Live! In Europe~/><p>His prolific output continued, as he followed up Deuce with Live in Europe (1972) and Blueprint and Tattoo, both in 1973. Irish Tour 1974, like Live in Europe, did a good job of capturing the excitement of his live shows on tape, and he followed that with Calling Card for Chrysalis in 1976, and Photo Finish and Jinx for the same label in 1978 and 1982. By this point, Gallagher had made several world tours, and he took a few years of rest from the road. He got back into recording and performing live again with the 1987 release (in the U.K.) of Defender. His last album, Fresh Evidence, was released in 1991 on the Capo/I.R.S. label. Capo was his own record and publishing company that he set up in the hopes of eventually exposing other great blues talents.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/rg-muddy-waters.jpg~ alt=~The London Muddy Waters Sessions~/><p>Some of Gallagher's best work on record wasn't under his own name; it's music he recorded with Muddy Waters on The London Sessions (Chess, 1972) and with Albert King on Live (RCA/Utopia, 1977). Gallagher made his last U.S. tours in 1985 and 1991, and admitted in interviews that he'd always been a guitarist who fed off the instant reaction and feedback a live audience can provide. In a 1991 interview, he said: ~I try to sit down and write a Rory Gallagher song, which generally happens to be quite bluesy. I try to find different issues, different themes and different topics that haven't been covered before...I've done songs in all the different styles...train blues, drinking blues, economic blues. But I try to find a slightly different angle on all these things. The music can be very traditional, but you can sort of creep into the future with the lyrics.~</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/rg-blues.jpg~ alt=~Blues~/><p>Gallagher passed away from complications after a liver transplant on June 14, 1995, at age 47. In 2019, to mark what would have been Gallagher's 50th year of recording, his estate released the four-disc anthology Blues, featuring rare and unreleased recordings from the '70s to the '90s.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><p>&mdash; <strong>Richard Skelly</strong></p>",

It not only established him in the States, where he had toured only once previously (with his first band Taste, opening for Blind Faith on their brief tour), and was a worldwide hit. Gallagher blasts through rearranged versions of three Junior Wells songs (~Messin' With the Kid,~ ~I Could've Had Religion,~ and ~Hoodoo Man~) and Muddy Waters' ~Bullfrog Blues,~ a holdover from his Taste days, like his fingers are exploding. Even on acoustic tracks like ~Going to My Home Town~ where Gallagher strums his mandolin with such ferocity it sounds like the strings are going to pop, he attacks with the intensity of a talented young man with something to prove. The songs average about six minutes, but Gallagher and his two-piece never let the energy flag. More crackling than even his best studio work, you can hear the electricity in the air as the Irishman shoots solos scorching with vitality and precision. The 2000 reissue includes two slow blues cuts, ~What in the World~ and ~Hoodoo Man~ where the guitarist pulls out his slide tricks, both are worthwhile additions. The liner notes feature a 1972 interview with the guitarist, but this is the only album of Buddha's 2000 reissued Gallagher catalog that doesn't include brother Donal's track-by-track synopsis. The crisp, clear remastered sound makes this one of the best live blues-rock albums ever, and one of the finest discs in Rory Gallagher's catalog. It's not quite like seeing him live, sweating through a vigorous, non-stop set, but it's the next best thing.</p>&mdash; <b>Hal Horowitz</b>"

Northern Ireland, in particular, was a rock & roll no-go area, but Gallagher never turned his back on the province and was rewarded with what history recalls as some of his best-ever gigs. Irish Tour 1974, in turn, captures some of his finest known live recordings and, while it's impossible to tell which songs were recorded where, across nine in-concert recordings (plus one after-hours jam session, ~Back on My Stompin' Ground~), the energy crackling from stage to stalls and back again packs an intensity that few live albums -- Gallagher's own others among them -- can match. Highlights of a stunning set include dramatic takes on Muddy Waters' ~I Wonder Who~ and Tony Joe White's ~As the Crow Flies,~ a raw acoustic rendering that is nevertheless totally electrifying. A frustratingly brief snip of the classic Shadows-style ~Maritime~ (aka ~Just a Little Bit~) plays the album out in anthemic style and then, of course, there's ~Walk on Hot Coals,~ a marathon excursion that posterity has decreed Gallagher's most popular and accomplished statement -- a status that Irish Tour 1974 does nothing to contradict. It's foolish playing favorites, however. Even more than Gallagher's earlier (1972) Live in Europe album, Irish Tour 1974 confirms Gallagher not simply as the greatest bluesman Ireland ever knew, but as one of the island's greatest-ever performers. The 1999 remaster adds nothing in the way of bonus material (shame), but greatly improves the sound quality.</p>&mdash; <b>Dave Thompson</b>"

They began their reissue program with his first two albums, then they moved to what most hardcore fans would consider the crown jewel of the series, a double-disc collection of Gallagher's BBC sessions. Like most lead guitarists (at least those of his generation), he would often expand his music when playing live, turning in vibrant, exciting versions of his material, peppered with great guitar solos. Although it lacks the kinetic spark generated whenever a musician performs in front of a live audience, BBC Sessions is one of the finest live sets in his catalog, thanks to its crystalline fidelity, strong performances and classy presentation. Certainly, this collection isn't for anyone that isn't already devoted to Gallagher, but for those that are, there's plenty to cherish here -- individual solos, impassioned vocals and good liner notes. It's an excellent, worthy addition to his catalog, and it helps confirm Gallagher's gift as a blues-rock guitarist.</P>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B>"

				"review": "<p>In nearly ten hours of footage, Live at Rockpalast 1976-1990 offers a varied perspective of Irish bluesman Rory Gallagher because its performances, filmed at various venues over a fifteen-year period, are just part of a complete package.</p><p>The interview included on the first of three discs furnishes something of a belated introduction to the artist that is the subject of the set. Graciously fielding some truly inane questions from the host of the German TV series, Gallagher nonetheless gives sincere answers, emphasizing the importance of bonding with the audience he plays for no matter the venue, He steadfastly refused to intellectualize what he does, but implies a serious, no-nonsense approach that carries over to his band. He is articulate if not eloquent, but then his guitar was his true means of expression after all.</p><p>It's startling to see what devotion Gallagher retained for his audiences and how that reciprocal loyalty fueled the fire of passionate performances. There are formal concerts here as well as jam sessions, including covers by Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry. Rory is occasionally joined by keyboards, horns and harp for extra instrumental color as well as guests lke Scottish soulman and kindred spirit Frankie Miller as well as the former bassist of Cream, Jack Bruce, for whom Rory graciously relegates himself and his band to backup.</p><p>The additional instrumentation, as when Gallagher himself pulls out the bottleneck, merely extends the gutsy intensity of the playing, whether the frontman is in acoustic or electric mode. His intensity rarely falters, even when he's chording away on the mandolin during ~Going to My Hometown. In watching the close- ups of his hands on the fretboard and hearing the ever so clean audio mix (5.1 is available too), one can only marvel that it is fortuitous indeed this singular talent was captured for posterity.</p><p>Glossy color photos the likes of which a fan will relish and a novice would find eye-catching adorn the cover of Live at Rockpalast 1976-1990. The graphics inside are no less arresting, while the pithy bio in the enclosed booklet, by noted British music journalist Chris Welch, along with the background info on the shows as offered by Donal Gallagher (who oversaw these all-posthumous releases of his brother's) make the double-fold package worth keeping in every respect.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Joe Viglione</strong></p>"

The 40 tracks that cover 43 tunes include the complete 1994 show on disc two along with bonus material on that second disc culled from the 1975, 1977, and 1985 shows. The first thing that hits you when watching the 1975 tapes is how great a guitarist he was when young and handsome at age 27. The playing is extraordinary and on target. If one looks at the cup as half full, the fact that Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, and Jimi Hendrix were gone at that age means that the 20 extra years of Gallagher music found here are a blessing and a plus. There are lots of different camera shots on the 1975 show, a high-energy edit to go along with the music, and some tremendous slide playing on ~Secret Agent~ (not the P.F. Sloan tune), a bluesy rocker that absolutely cooks. On disc two, fast forward ten years to 1985, and his proficiency on the acoustic guitar with ~Walking Blues~ is just as powerful as the loud electric guitar. Gallagher had played the legendary jazz festival with his band Taste on two occasions prior to these five solo performances, and during the 1994 show is almost a different fellow from the one you witness 20 years prior. An older blues statesman, he's not bouncing around on the stage in 1994, the guitar tones are decidedly lower, the growl is intact, and the music is just as exciting and pure. This package comes with an eight-page foldout that includes three pages of liner notes penned by London journalist Chris Welch. Extraordinary in its scope, this truly is a ~Definitive Collection,~ as the title says, and aside from the historical importance, is solid entertainment that will hold your attention.

				"review": "<p>The compilation Big Guns: The Very Best of Rory Gallagher, is one of the ways assembling a retrospective should be done. Released in 2005, however, Rory Gallagher's music could not be more of an anachronism. Even with the late-'90s/early-2000s blues revival on public television, on recordings, and in stadiums and taverns across the globe, Gallagher's name is seldom mentioned. This set offers a portrait of a true guitar hero and songwriter, one whose flash never outweighed his substance, one whose work is so utterly and dazzlingly fresh it not only stands the test of time, but transcends it. Being an Irish bluesman was tough for Gallagher, especially when he began his career in the 1960s. Gallagher passed away in 1995 at the age of 47. He left behind 17 albums and a legacy of hard traditional blues and big, knotty blues-rock. These two discs are the first retrospective to span the entire length of his career from his time with the power trio Taste, to his signature albums like Calling Card and Deuce, through to his final acoustic album, Wheels Within Wheels (released posthumously). There are many gems here beginning with ~Born on the Wrong Side of Time~ by Taste, and unreleased live versions of the traditional ~Bullfrog Blues~ and Junior Wells' ~Messin With the Kid.~ The stone killers are cuts that Gallagher's fans recognize him for, such as ~Tatoo'd Lady,~ the title number from Calling Card, or ~I'm Not Awake Yet~ from Deuce. There are also fine moments from later in his career as well, such as ~Kickback City~ from Defender and ~Bad Penny~ from Top Priority (though it would have been better if the compilers had picked ~Philby~ or ~Follow Me.~) ~Sinner Boy~ is here from Live at the Isle of Wight, along with ~What's Goin' On~ (not the Marvin Gaye tune). While fans may quibble about individual selections, the only glaring omission is the absence of the stellar ~Walk on Hot Coals.~ The package is fine enough with numerous autobiographical quotes from Gallagher, a slew of good photos, and a good liner essay by David Sinclair. While it may be the tried and true devotees that seek this out ultimately, the music listener who would most benefit is the one interested in the evolution of blues or in fine guitar players. For the latter, Big Guns would be nothing short of a revelation.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

				"review": "<p>Released five years after his last effort (an eternity for the prolific Irish blues guitar slinger who had been churning out at least an album a year throughout the '70s), Defender is another quality blues-rock offering. Although Gallagher is in fine tough form here and it was his debut release for his own indie label, there is little difference between this and some of his less stellar '70s albums like Top Priority and Photo-Finish. The pounding, guitar-heavy opener ~Kickback City~ sounds more like hairy rockers Bad Company than anything approaching the deep Chicago and country blues Gallagher dearly loved. The quality picks up substantially as the volume subsides on ~Loanshark Blues,~ but by-the-books crunch-rockers like ~Failsafe Day~ and the unfortunately titled ~Road to Hell~ don't bode well for Gallagher moving out from an increasingly formulaic pigeonhole. There are a few corkers here like ~Continental Op,~ a blazing riff that stands with Gallagher's best work and revisits his familiar cloak-and-dagger theme. The swampy, less abrasive ~I Ain't No Saint~ also pushes the quality up a few notches, as does his gritty version of Sonny Boy Williamson's ~Don't Start Me to Talking,~ the bluesiest song on the disc and one of the few times he pulls out his greasy slide. ~Seven Days~ is the lone acoustic track and it's a good one, with piano and harp accompaniment and Gallagher singing like he means it as he takes the part of a criminal fleeing from the electric chair. The 2000 reissue adds a pair of rugged bonus tracks (along with a cleaner sound mix), which are actually better, or certainly as good as the best cuts on the rest of this competent but hardly essential Rory Gallagher disc.</p>&mdash; <b>Hal Horowitz</b>"

He had won a competition for amateur jazz players back in 1962, leading to his first gigs. Garbarek worked steadily in Norway throughout the remainder of the 1960s, usually as a leader but also for four years with George Russell (who was in Scandinavia for a long stretch). Garbarek began recording for ECM in the early '70s and, although he had opportunities to play with Chick Corea and Don Cherry, his association with Keith Jarrett's European quartet in the mid-'70s made him famous, resulting in the classic recordings My Song and Belonging. In the 1980s, Garbarek's groups included bassist Eberhard Weber and at various times guitarists Bill Frisell and David Torn. Garbarek, whose sound is virtually unchanged since the 1970s, collaborated with the Hilliard Ensemble in 1993 (a vocal quartet singing Renaissance music) and the result was a surprisingly popular recording. Visible World followed in 1995, and four years later he resurfaced with Rites. In April of 1999, Garbarek and the Hilliard Ensemble returned with Mnemosyne.</p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b>",

The disc opens with ~He Came From the North,~ which features a melody based on a traditional Lapp joik from the artist's native Norway and progresses into a longer section with an interplay that is both sparse and rhythmic. The sax line here is astonishingly beautiful. The second piece, ~Alchuri, the Song Man,~ a sax and percussion piece, is energetic and lively as well. And from here the energy gradually diminishes. Much can be attributed to popular styles of the time, but this release simply does not stand up to other music of its genre that came later.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Mark Allender</strong></p>"

This album in particular puts that sound front and center. Garbarek's the show; he composed all of the music, and is essentially the only soloist. The music (much of which was composed as soundtrack material for film or video) is quintessential Garbarek, full of the world music influences that have characterized his work since the 1970s. Garbarek's resonant, carefully articulated tenor and soprano tone suits the spacious, minor/modal themes. He's as much a singer as instrumentalist. Garbarek also plays digital synthesizers, mostly as string or flute pads underneath the folkish melodies. The record's most notable secondary player is Garbarek's ECM labelmate, the bassist Eberhard Weber, whose lyric sensibility is a virtual mirror of Garbarek's. This is quiet, contemplative music for the most part -- attractive, but not superficially pretty. Its grooves are less celebratory than melancholic. There's an intensity here borne of deep concentration and commitment to beauty. Garbarek has come a long way since his early days as a quasi-free jazz experimentalist. This music is not jazz, nor is it experimental. But it is compelling in its way, representative of a first-rate creative musician, beyond category.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Chris Kelsey</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Since the late '70s, Jan Garbarek has been carving out a place within jazz for the folk and spiritual traditions of the indigenous peoples of Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and finally of those people all over the world. Rites, a double CD, is his attempt at forging a synthesis that takes improvisation into the heart of ritual music and creates a new form of spiritual from them both. Using a strategy for each of the discs, the first one digs deep into the spiritual and mystical side of his language. Garbarek plays soprano and tenor as well as synthesizers, drum machines, and samples — always understated, always elegant — and utilizes the talents of some of his running mates as well as new ones. Rainer Bruninghaus appears sporadically throughout, as does bassist Eberhard Weber, and drummer/percussion wizard Marilyn Mazur is ubiquitous. The music is slow, tenuous, and repetitive. It hardly matters — on disc one, anyway — which of the pieces are being played. All of them have spare, chant-like melodies that are lifted by myriad percussion instruments and keyboards, which provide a spacious ambience in which to enfold them both. Even Garbarek's trademark icy saxophone — usually made more so by Manfred Eicher's production — is warm, watery, and deeply entrenched in this warm mix that falls over listeners like a fine meditation blanket; like that blanket, it begins to stir emotions from deep within the heart of the listener. While these songs all segue into one another, it is worth noting that Garbarek recut ~It's OK to Listen to the Grey Voice~ for this collection, where it's performed with deeper conviction and fits better than it did on the album it was named for. Disc two of Rites is a bit of a different story. While the music is indeed intended for ritual, it comes from the celebratory side of the aisle rather than the contemplative one. Here are dances, Garbarek's versions of gospel shouts, processionals, festival waltzes, and all manner of joyful ceremonies completing the circle. On one collection, listeners get music for prayer, contemplation, and grief, as well as a funky European read of indigenous music for moving to and celebrating. Clearly this is what sets Rites above Garbarek's other recordings, him taking that balance he possessed so early in his career back again and putting it to work in a near-sacred setting.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

Here, their range straddles no less than three milleniums (just missing a fourth by a couple of years), from the ~Delphic Paean~ of Athenaeus circa 127 B.C. to a lullaby by the contemporary Estonian composer Veljo Tormis, with intervening contributions by Hildegard von Bingen, William Billings, and Thomas Tallis, Iroquois Indians, Basque and Peruvian folksongs, and many more far-flung choices. Most daringly, the four voices themselves now start to improvise on scraps of ancient material culled from old book bindings and the like, though it's hard to determine exactly where this occurs (probably during some passages of wordless vocalise). Ultimately, despite the freer methods, the results are often pretty much the same as Officium on disc one -- soothing, timeless sonic frescos reverberantly recorded in the same Austrian St. Gerold monastery, with Garbarek soaring over or threading through the texture ever more sparingly. Yet on disc two, Garbarek and the Hilliards start to move into other worlds, breaking into something more disturbing and even atonal in that ancient ~Delphic Paean,~ the syncopated harmonies of Garbarek's own ~Loiterando,~ or a strange-sounding Russian Psalm from the 16th century. This is a collaboration in transition, and one hopes it will continue to evolve.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Richard S. Ginell</b></p>"

				"review": "<p>Jan Garbarek is the quintessential ECM artiste -- adventurous; disdainful of categories; in possession of a wailing tone well-suited to producer Manfred Eicher's reverberant, airy sonic tastes; and a devotee of the school of wide open spaces without clutter. The latter two points are important, for they unify what might otherwise be a wildly scattered collection of shooting asteroids into a single orbit. Giving all of this eclecticism some general shape, disc one of Garbarek's Rarum volume deals with his sessions as a leader, often with the ethereal mood in play, while the second disc is devoted to the Norwegian saxophonist's collaborations with his celebrated friends from Europe and America over a 22-year span. The first disc has a carefully terraced sense of flow from start to finish, with the opening horn calls of ~Skrik & Hyl~ and ~Viddene~ sounding as if they came from high on a mountaintop, with bass, then guitar, then pipe organ as backdrops. With ~Lillekort,~ things get moving in a light Brazilian bag with Nana Vasconcelos providing the groove and the nicely striding ~It's OK to Listen to the Gray Voice.~ The set then veers into some ethereal solo tracks, where Garbarek works with tapes of himself on excerpts from the albums All Those Born With Wings and Legend of the Seven Dreams and reaches a peak of energy on the penultimate track, the title tune of the Twelve Moons album. Within this overall context, the lengthy ~Raga I,~ with a host of Indian musicians, seems not at all out of place, nor is Shankar's playful ~Song for Everyone~ on disc two. Paying homage where homage is due, four of the first five tracks of disc two are some of Garbarek's collaborations with Keith Jarrett in the '70s -- ranging from the esoteric (the lugubriously orchestrated ~Windsong~ from Luminessence) to some snapshots of the Jarrett European quartet that put Garbarek on the map. Interestingly, in Jarrett's Rarum volume, the pianist writes that he would have liked to have included ~Sunshine Song~ (from Nude Ants) and a track from Luminessence on his own collection. What he doesn't say is that they turned up on Garbarek's album instead. A coincidence of telepathic tastes -- or concealed collusion? Aside from the European quartet tracks, the disc reverts to Garbarek's spare, freewheeling conception of sound, featuring sessions led by guitarists Ralph Towner and Egberto Gismonti, and finally a taste of Garbarek's audacious yet lovely collaboration with the early music Hilliard Ensemble. Alas, Garbarek's liner notes aren't of much use as a guide; he is merely content to thank some of his co-conspirators -- mainly Eicher and Jarrett.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richard S.

For In Praise of Dreams Garbarek enlisted violist Kim Kashkashian and frequent collaborator Manu Katché on drums. Garbarek, who composed the album's 11 selections, plays saxophones as well as a host of keyboards and percussion, while Katché plays acoustic and electronic drums along with Kashkashian's viola. In many ways this is the most radical recording that Garbarek has ever issued, but not because it's outside — quite the opposite. This is easily the warmest, most accessible outing Garbarek has ever issued because though there are no vocals, Garbarek has clearly written ~songs~ on this set, with identifiable structures that are followed almost throughout. Though he is no stranger to the form, having employed it almost continually for the last 20 years, he has never engaged it so thoroughly and completely. Previously, he has engaged improvisation to get song to the breaking point and move it somewhere else. Here it is always present; surprise happens inside the formal frameworks of these compositions. Beautiful, soulful lines underscore and recontextualize the saxophonist's trademark Nordic iciness of tone on the opener, ~As Seen from Above,~ with its spiraling soprano, lush keyboards, and hypnotic loops. In its warmth, it comes very close to a distinctly European kind of groove/soul-jazz.</p><p>The interplay between Kashkashian and Garbarek on the title track offers rounded, multidimensional sonorities winding through the intro before spilling into a call-and-response melody. The repetitive keyboard line and Katché's mantra-like drumming under the loops draw the listener inside the song's heart and extend the edge for the front line. The restrained romanticism shown by Kashkashian on her nocturnal solo intro to ~One Goes There Alone~ is nearly breathtaking. As it gives way to the tune itself, it's slow, reflective, and rooted deeply in the tension created between percussion and Garbarek's minimal backing response lines. When he solos later in the tune, he's clearly blowing blues into her elegiac line. The blues notion continues in his phrasing on ~Knot of Place and Time,~ slipping through the landscape of Kashkashian's elegant, near heartbreakingly poetic soundscape. And so it goes. Things get more speculative on ~Scene from Afar~ and ~Cloud of Unknowing,~ but it hardly matters since these song forms are nonetheless immediately recognizable, presenting the nether side of the equation. It emerges again with ~Conversation With a Stone~ and whispers to a close with ~A Tale Begun,~ a mantra-like duet that closes this strong set that will undoubtedly, if it gets the opportunity to be heard, garner Jan Garbarek some new fans. Poetic, moving, and marvelous, In Praise of Dreams is a welcome return.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

				"review": "<p>Elixir is the first album Danish percussionist Marilyn Mazur has recorded as a leader for ECM in 14 years. It is an interesting number for Mazur, because she has also spent 14 years as a member of saxophonist Jan Garbarek's recording and touring ensembles. He appears on about half of Elixir as Mazur's only collaborator (apart from producer Manfred Eicher). That said, the solo pieces are the first remarkable aspect of this set. When Mazur works alone, her pieces defy everything we think we know about solo percussion recordings: there is a warmth and directness in these proceedings that is songlike rather than merely hypnotic or virtuosic. There is much to tell here, not merely to show. These short works are, in effect, aural stories. They arise from her intuitive understanding of an instrument and sound as well as her improvisational abilities as a percussionist, but they emerge as almost sung narratives told on her array of bells, marimba, bowed vibraphones, log drums, udu, cymbals, gongs, waterphone, hang, and metal utensils -- instruments and tools from all of the earth's continents. They are startling vignettes, because they offer a connection to something earlier to be sure, but also to something very universal in their accessibility as a kind of folk art. When she works with Garbarek, the sheer intuitive nature of their communication is simply startling. They do know one another well, but this is truly out of the ordinary. To be honest, as fine as Garbarek's own records have been, listeners haven't really heard him play like this for many years. The structured melodies and dynamic reaches in ~Orientales,~ for instance, come from a very simple idea that he modulates on and returns to over and over again, but his intonation and sense of attack are very different than on his own records. Likewise, the tribal-sounding ~Dunun Song~ allows for the saxophonist to take his tenor and dance along a thematic idea that is as rooted in blues and New Orleans music as it is in African cultures. The relatively free abstraction in ~Winter Wish,~ the longest of these 21 improvisations at a little over four minutes, is nonetheless measured by Mazur's sense of pace and space, and how her own measured tones offer another voice for her collaborator. The beautiful cymbal, cowbell, and log drums on ~Creature Walk~ are knotty, ever shifting in pulse and timbre, but always toward rather than away from the listener. The nocturnal waterphone on ~Metal Dew,~ with the longish tones of shimmering small bells and rubbed cymbals, presents another piece of musical alchemy that, while sounding utterly strange and almost exotic, is nonetheless fantastically approachable and beautifully nuanced. In fact, the manner in which this album is structured draws the listener from front to back without once being overwhelming. Indeed, if anything, one is drawn increasingly and with great fascination into these gorgeous rhythmic poems, as if to a new land that is simultaneously welcoming and strange. Fantastic.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>It's hard to believe that after recording as a leader for 40 years, Dresden: In Concert is Jan Garbarek's first-ever live album. He has recorded sparely in 21st century thus far, but he has toured regularly. For those who think that Garbarek abandoned jazz some time ago, this will be a shock. Dresden is an engaged, kinetic, double-disc, two-hour performance of his quartet playing in the modern jazz idiom and using all of its tenets -- from complex harmonics and rhythmic invention to extended lyric improvisation -- to create a tour de force that honors all the music he holds dear.</p><p>Garbarek plays tenor, soprano, and the selje flute; he is accompanied by his regular group that includes drummer Manu Katche, pianist/keyboadist Rainer Brüninghaus, and electric bassist Yuri Daniel. There are 16 compositions that include tracks from his own albums -- some of them radically but exquisitely revamped for this quartet and performance. There are also tunes by his bandmates, and an extended, stellar reading of Milton Nascimento's gorgeous ~Milagro Dos Piexes,~ that features some of the most inventive and dynamic dialogue between Garbarek and Brüninghaus on record.</p><p>The forcefulness of Garbarek's own playing will surprise casual listeners while making veteran's reference his earliest recordings for ECM. His solo on the opening cut, ~Paper Nut~ (a tune he composed for L. Shankar's Song for Everyone album), is immediately recognizable, yet is startling for its forcefulness and physicality. Likewise, Katche's double-timed yet groove-laden syncopation provides a backdrop for the saxophonist to move his harmonically extended meditation to the margins. And he does so in the middle, recalling the fireworks of his earliest recordings. His knotty arpeggios go head to head with his drummer, who simply cannot be shaken. When the ensemble comes together in the middle of the tune, they swing hard, and are added to by a gorgeous solo from Brüninghaus. Katche's in an amazing foil for Garbarek, because he understands not only the intricate shapeshifting and intensities in jazz, but has street grooves and rhythm & blues shuffles down cold -- in both vintage and modern contexts -- as well. Garbarek radically reworks ~Once I Wished a Tree Upside Down,~ a piece he wrote for Trilok Gurtu's Living Magic album. Whereas the former was comprised mainly of hand drums and synthesizers, this version, introduced by Brüninghaus playing a South African township cadence on the piano and Katche's breakbeats, is both streetwise and folk-rooted while being utterly redolent of 21st millennium jazz. The ballad ~There Were Swallows~ (one of the tunes from 1992's Twelve Moons album) loses none of its graceful restraint here, fueled by Brüninghaus' piano and sung poetically by Garbarek's soprano. The final track on the set, ~Voy Cantando~ from 1988's Legend of the Seven Dreams, clocks in at over 11 minutes and is arguably the toughest thing here; it's funky but with a long modal excursion in the middle and a very complex, tenor solo from Garbarek. ~Maracuja~ carries within it an easy sense of swing, a reggae backbeat, and contains killer basswork by Daniel, all within a folk song. The same goes for ~Heitor,~ which commences with a folkish melody and extends itself into the hinterlands of creative ensemble playing while losing none of its ability to swing.</p><p>In sum, Dresden is an event, not only in Garbarek's career, but in ECM's as we'll -- after all, it's their 40th anniversary this year, too -- in the same way that the Keith Jarrett's Köln Concert or the Out-of-Towners' trio date was. It's a live concert recording capturing nearly all the energy, creativity, and presences of sound and dynamics on compact disc that audiences in the seats encountered.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Peter Garrett was never made for politics. A passionate idealist, how he kept sane whilst his environmental policies and integrity were constantly sold out in the name of party politics, is anyone's guess.</p><p>Ironically, after resigning amidst the turbulence of the most pathetic era of Australian polutics (sic) – an era where our leaders (such as they are) and their integrity (if you can find any) became ever more one dimensional, spineless and blatantly dishonest – hindsight shows us that his charismatic, pre-politics self is arguably the Prime Minister this country needs more than ever, rather than the scumbags who are actually in the running for the job.</p><p>It seems inevitable, then, that he's come back to music, reforming Midnight Oil (despite vehement protestations by the organisation that that was NOT an option not too many months ago), and finally releasing his debut solo album.</p><p>Musically, A Version Of Now occupies the same sort of territory as The Oils. Lyrically there is a treasure trove of snippets which personal and political observers will (and have) leap upon to feed their theories about the whys and wherefores of his political career. To Garrett's credit, however, he doesn't use the album as a podium for mudslinging and muckracking – in fact, if anything, he defends his integrity, insisting in I’d Do It Again, 'I went of my own accord to do what I could/I got my hands dirty I had a go.' Can’t blame the guy for trying.</p><p>Freed of the need to compromise his beliefs and integrity in the name of (what is laughingly called) ~the greater good~, Garrett is surprisingly sanguine about a chapter of his life that simply didn’t live up to his aspirations. The closest he gets to commentary on those often dark days is in Tall Trees, stating, ~I saw the best of men and I saw the worse/I saw the best of woman too, from governor to nurse~ and ~While all the glory hunters were basking in false smiles/Twisted egos and ambitions mile after mile/I went to find a quiet place away from the madding mob/To try and make a difference get on with the job and do it again~. It's cutting, but measured as well, and no doubt after swimming in those murky waters the need for a return to home and family life was strong, hence the inclusion of not only two love songs to his wife Doris, but also his three daughters singing on the album.</p><p>Having delivered this very restrained (and very nice) album, and with an autobiographical memoir coming very soon, the time is ripe for Garrett to deliver a proper follow-up (under his own name or as Midnight Oil) that is full of the fiery political statement that he was famous for in his younger days.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Shane Pinnegar</strong></p>"

Sadly, George died of a heart attack while on the road; he left behind a body of gritty, eclectic, and funky rock & roll.

				"review": "<p>Thanks I'll Eat it Here is strikingly different from the fusion-leanings of Little Feat's last studio album, Time Loves a Hero. Lowell George never cared for jazz-fusion, so it should be little surprise that there's none to be heard on Thanks. Instead, he picks up where Dixie Chicken left off (he even reworks that album's standout ~Two Trains~), turning in a laid-back, organic collection of tunes equal parts New Orleans R&B, country, sophisticated blues, and pop. George wasn't in good health during the sessions for Thanks, which you wouldn't tell by his engaging performances, but from the lack of new tunes. Out of the nine songs on the album, only three are originals, and they're all collaborations. That's a drawback only in retrospect - it's hard not to wish that the last album George completed had more of his own songs - but Lowell was a first-rate interpreter, so even covers of Allen Toussaint (~What Do You Want the Girl to Do~), Ann Peebles (~I Can't Stand the Rain~) and Rickie Lee Jones (~Easy Money~) wind up sounding of piece with the original songs. George's music rolls so easy, the album can seem a little slight at first, but it winds up being a real charmer. Yes, a few songs drift by and, yes, Jimmy Webb's vaudevellian ~Himmler's Ring~ feels terribly out of place, but Lowell's style is so distinctive and his performances so soulful, it's hard not to like this record if you've ever had a fondness for Little Feat. After all, it's earthier and more satisfying than any Feat album since Feats Don't Fail Me Now and it has the absolutely gorgeous ~20 Million Things,~ the last great song George ever wrote.</p> &mdash;<b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Few musicians mirror Los Angeles's tradition of rock chameleons better than Lowell George, son of a Hollywood furrier and the brilliant, short-lived auteur that shaped Little Feat's '70s sound and fury before retreating to allow a more democratic if less gripping chemistry to surface. George's hearty but lyrical, blues-rimmed voice, signature electric slide guitar, and infectious, often surreal songs defined the band--as did his production on their pivotal mid-decade albums, which convinced more than a few listeners that they were Southerners. His 1979 solo album, recorded shortly before his untimely death, mixed new originals (~Honest Man,~ ~Cheek to Cheek,~ ~Himmler's Ring,~ and the touching ~20 Million Things~ among them) with smart R&B covers from Allen Toussaint (~What Do You Want the Girl to Do~) and Ann Peebles (~I Can't Stand the Rain~), dressed in tight brass choruses and sleek backing choruses, and fit snugly with the Feat canon.</p>&mdash; <b>Sam Sutherland</b>"

His tracks `I'm a Kite (Won't You Be My Hurricane?)' and `The Joke's on You' appeared on the Oz label's Various Artists album <i>The Debutantes</i> (1977). Gillespie also issued Make Up, a collection of prose and poetry published by Outback Press.</p><p>Gillespie's debut single `Savanarola'/`Just Wanna Ball' came out credited to Mark Gillespie and the Victims in 1978. His band at that point comprised Mick `The Reverend' O'Connor (keyboards), Bruno De Stanislo (bass; ex-One Nite Stand) and Peter Reed (drums; ex-Hot Dog, One Nite Stand). Gillespie issued a single on Festival/Infinity, `Coming Back for More'/`Alligator Music' (April 1979), before coming to wider attention when he supported Maria Muldaur, Tom Waits and Rodriguez on their respective Australian tours. Gillespie's touring band comprised O'Connor, Broderick Smith (vocals, harmonica, guitar; ex-Dingoes), Stephen Cooney (guitar), Clive Harrison (bass, backing vocals; ex-Kush, Avalanche), Trevor Courtney (drums; ex-Chants R&B, Vibrants, Skylight), Stewart Watson (fiddle, mandolin, guitar) and Pat and Gay L'Nane (backing vocals). </p><p>Gillespie recorded his brilliant debut album, <i>Only Human</i>, with assistance from Joe Creighton (bass; ex-Billy T), Ross Hannaford (guitar, backing vocals; ex-Daddy Cool), Rex Bullen (keyboards; ex-Bakery), Mark Meyer (drums) and Lisa Bade (backing vocals). Gillespie sang as well as playing guitar, keyboards and mandolin. The album produced the singles `Only Human'/`Long & Strong' (June 1980) and `Small Mercies'/`Black Angels' (September). `Deep as You'/`Stronger Together', `Together' followed in April 1981. Gillespie travelled throughout Asia before recording his second album, <i>Sweet Nothing</i>. His backing band again included Hannaford, Meyer and Bade, plus Tim Partridge (bass), Andrew Thompson (sax), Gary Lyon (backing vocals) and Nikki Nicholls (backing vocals). Sweet Nothing (March 1982) took Gillespie into the national Top 40 for the first time when it peaked at #32. The album also reached #9 in Melbourne. <i>Sweet Nothing</i> yielded three singles, `Nothing Special'/`Passing' (February), `Traveller in the Night'/`Swing Tonight' (June) and `Night & Day'/`Looking for You' (October). </p><p>Gillespie's third album, <i>Mark Gillespie</i> (aka Ring of Truth) (January 1984) produced the singles `Ring of Truth'/`All for Your Love' (November 1983), `You'/`Thanks' (also November 1983) and `Letting Go'/`Animal' (May 1984). Backing Gillespie on the album was drummer Geoff Bridgeford (ex-Groove, Bee Gees). Little was heard from Gillespie on the music scene for some time. He returned to Asia and founded an orphanage in Bangladesh. He re-emerged in Australia during 1992 and issued the album <i>Flame</i>, the CD single `Long Time' and the CD EP `Don't Wait' on the Aurora label. </p><p>Members of his backing band around that time included old mates Joe Creighton and Ross Hannaford, plus James Black (keyboards; ex-Russell Morris Band, Mondo Rock, Revelators), Angus Burchill (drums; John Farnham Band), Alex Pertout (percussion), John Watson (drums; ex-Australian Crawl, Kevin Borich Express), Shane O'Mara (guitar; ex-Stephen Cummings Band) and Bill McDonald (bass; ex-Hot Half Hour, Deborah Conway Band). </p>&mdash; <b>Ian McFarlane</b>",

				"review": "<p>They don't come much more eccentric than Mark Gillespie. Best known for 1980 debut album Only Human, the one-time Melbourne singer-songwriter refused to play the music industry game. Instead of touring behind that record or giving interviews, he travelled through Asia. His genre-hopping songs, meanwhile, indulge in weird arrangements and dark, philosophical lyrics. Before turning to music, Gillespie had written short stories, co-founded the Aussie-centric Outback Press, and done a six-year architecture degree at Melbourne Uni. Today he lives in Bangladesh, where he works at an orphanage, writes songs in the jungle, and has penned a text-message novella called No Hope. Not your average troubadour, then.</p><p>Last year Aztec reissued Only Human as a two-disc package with comprehensive liner notes and Gillespie's offbeat commentary. Now comes the second entry in his four-album career. Although it doesn't quite have the anything-is-possible vibe of the first, Sweet Nothing (1981) keeps several of its players and again enlists producer John Sayers (Radio Birdman, John Williamson). Daddy Cool's Ross Hannaford, who was on board for Only Human, plays guitar on two songs, and there are backing singers, synths, and saxophone. Like Only Human, this is a fascinating combination of '70s singer-songwriter-isms and the now-cheesy production values of the early '80s.</p><p>But it's much more than that, too. While seeming innocuous enough, the title sums up the startling existential quandary of Gillespie's songs. Uplifting music is often paired with bleak themes as he rattles off the kind of lines you wouldn't expect to hear from a singer-songwriter even today. On the self-reflexive opener 'Nothing Special', Gillespie describes America's iconic Midnight Special train line as something that will deliver him to the promised land. Backing singers come in just after he sings, ~I think I hear the gospel band~, but by the time he announces, ~There's nothin' special in this world~, his optimism has drained away and he seems to be staring head-on into oblivion. The train becomes downright menacing, and Gillespie watches it roar past him with fear and hopelessness in his gut.</p><p>And that's all in the first track. Later, 'Swing Tonight' proves to be a burbling funk-pop number about suicide (~We're all gonna swing tonight~) and 'Miss Right' darkly intones ~I know you're gonna be Miss Wrong.~ 'Night & Day' sees society robbing one's identity (~They might give you all a number/You don't have a say~), while 'Rivers of Blood' is as unsparing in its imagery as you'd expect from that title.<p><p>Amid all that pessimism, though, the music remains jaunty, twanging, and spiked with playful bass lines and harmonies. Despite warnings about seeking meaning in love and money, 'Traveller in the Night' strongly recalls the skeletal funk and underdog yearning of the Stones classic 'Beast of Burden'. Other tracks summon Cat Stevens, Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, and 'Wild Night'-era Van Morrison, while 'Pile-Up' seems to lift a page from the art-school adventures of Talking Heads.<p><p>This re-mastered edition includes much briefer liner notes than Only Human and only two b-sides as bonus tracks: the barroom gospel of 'Passing' and the layered 'Looking for You'. That means it's still best to start with Only Human. It's also worth noting that three of these songs had rawer incarnations in 1978's demo batch The Black Tape, which was included with the Only Human reissue: a meditative eight-minute version of 'Nothing Special', a bluesier 'Stormy Night' with prominent female vocals, and a gospel-edged version of 'Miss Right' called 'Another Ms. Wrong'.<p><p>~While seeming innocuous enough, the title sums up the startling existential quandary of Gillespie's songs.~<p><p>At the time of its release, Sweet Nothing peaked in the top 10 on the Melbourne charts and in the top 30 nationally. And aversion to self-promotion aside, Gillespie appeared on Countdown and supported the likes of Rodriguez, Tom Waits, and Jackson Browne in his day. But he didn't want to be a star, as proven by his stubborn attitude, as well as his current line of work. Knowing how things turned out for him only enhances Sweet Nothing's recurrent theme of struggling to find one's place in an unforgiving life. On the near-psychedelic 'Hand to Hand', Gillespie doesn't mince words: ~But if there was some reason to live/Then there would be something to understand.~<p><p>He's since found a reason to live, but he's left behind some bold artefacts from his days of peering into the void. At his best, Gillespie was an unflinching poet of lost souls, mixing doubtful messages of hope with resounding portraits of despair.<p><p><strong>&mdash;Doug Wallen</strong></p>"

		"name": "Glenn Gould",
		"biography": "<p>The defining moment of Glenn Gould's career came in 1964 when, at the age of 31, he withdrew from all public performance. The move was viewed by audiences and critics as willful and bewildering, and was seen as evidence that despite his demonstrably supreme artistry he was, in the argot of the common man, a nut.</p><p>But, as George Szell once said of him, ~That nut [was] a genius.~ In his short international career, which spanned only 24 years, Glenn Gould changed the way the music world thought about performance practice, recording, and the music of Johann Sebastian Bach.</p><p>Glenn Gould was born to comfortable middle-class parents in Toronto in 1932. A pampered only child, Gould demonstrated his remarkable talents quite early and in 1943 entered the Toronto Conservatory of Music, where he quickly came to the attention of its director, Sir Ernest MacMillan. On MacMillan's recommendation, Gould was taken on as a student by the Chilean-born pedagogue Alberto Guerrero, whose own style was partly the basis for Gould's own sensitive touch. Gould once described Guerrero's keyboard technique as not so much striking the keys as ~pulling them down.~ The other influence on Gould's technique was his experience playing the organ, wherein the tracker action is particularly responsive to variations in finger pressure.</p><p>Gould made his debut at the age of 16, playing Beethoven's fourth piano concerto in Toronto. He followed this triumph with tours across Canada and frequent broadcast performances over the CBC, introducing him to the studio enviroment which would remain a focus of his life thereafter. Gould leaped into international acclaim, in fact, through a studio production: his now-legendary 1955 Columbia Masterworks recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations. This recording, which has never been out of print in the 50 years since its first release, established Gould as a performer who combined penetrating insight (his Goldberg Variations was nothing short of a complete rethinking of the piece) and artistic daring with daunting technical prowess.</p><p>Gould's immediate fame brought international demand, and he responded with worldwide concert appearances; he met these with considerable reluctance, however, and quickly gained a reputation for last-minute cancellations. His dislike of performing in public, of being ~looked at~ by audiences, allowed a natural tendency of hypochondria to blossom (it was a convenient cancellation excuse), and he soon became the habitue of specialists ranging from chiropractors to psychiatrists. Long before quitting the stage forever, Gould had made frequent threats to do so, so that his 1964 decision was no surprise to those who knew him.</p><p>Following his withdrawal, Gould threw himself into a frenzy of recording, writing, and radio documentary production. His method of splicing together single performances from dozens of takes was initially viewed as something of an artistic fraud, though the technique was eventually adopted, in less exhaustive form, by the recording industry in subsequent years. His radio documentaries were less successful: a trilogy about life in Canada's northern territories combined multiple interviews in contrapuntal ways, an interesting idea that nevertheless rendered the sense of what was being said more or less unintelligible.</p><p>Though plagued by many imaginary maladies, Gould suffered from a very real hypertension that eventually led to a massive stroke, which he suffered in 1982, and from which he never recovered. He died in Toronto General Hospital, one week after being stricken, on October 4, 1982, at age 50.</p>&mdash; <b>Mark Satola</b>",

				"review": "<p>If there is a piece of music most associated with one performer, then surely it is Bach's Goldberg Variations, and Glenn Gould. Gould made the Goldberg Variations, and the Goldberg Variations certainly made Glenn Gould.</p><p>Gould had made his concert debut at age 16. Then, while known in Canada through his concert appearances, he burst onto the international stage with his first recording, the now-legendary 1955 version of the Goldberg Variations.</p><p>The young, headstrong Gould had completely rejected the common romantic interpretations of Bach as performed by Wanda Landowska. He brought an ice-down-the-back-of-the-shirt clarity to Bach's neglected keyboard masterpiece, and turned it into a best-seller, and himself into a star. In fact, the recording has never been out of print in the almost 50 years since it was recorded.</p><p>Landowska's famous statement to a pianist ~You play Bach your way, and I'll play him his way~ becomes ironic after you've heard Glenn Gould bring out every nuance of counterpoint in these works, revealing their full complexity. Glenn Gould's performances are usually described with words such as cold, crystalline, icey, sharp, intellectual, impeccable, eccentric and arrogant. Not all complimentary words. After hearing this version of the Goldbergs I must add to this list lighthearted, free, friendly, delicate, witty and fulfilling.</p><p>Bach's Goldberg Variations are one of those rare works in classical music that have instant appeal to beginners, but also a richness and complexity that gratifies the expert. The more you look, the more you find, and it is impossible to tire of them.</p><p>Tradition has it that Bach was commissioned by the insomniac Count Keyserlingk to write the pieces for his court musician Johann Gottlieb Goldberg to play to help him sleep. As Gould says in his liner notes to the 1955 recording, this is a charming story and difficult to disprove.</p><p>But there remains much scepticism: Goldberg was just 14 years old when it was published, and his keyboard skills may not have been adequate for the task, there is no dedication on the title page (as was customary), and there is no evidence of the golden chalice that Keyserlingk was supposed to have paid Bach for the music.</p><p>For those interested in Bach's almost mathematical structures, the Goldberg Variations will fascinate. The Aria, a Saraband, appears like two pillars at either end of the work. In between are 30 variations, grouped into 10 groups of three. Each set of 3 pieces is a free variation, a variation in duet and a canon. Thus every third piece is a canon, starting with a canon in unison (ie the canonic parts are in the same key) followed by ever increasing intervals until the 27th variation, a canon in ninth.</p><p>As a musical joke, the 30th variation is not a canon at all, but a quodlibet, music where two independent melodies are played together. Here Bach uses two low-brow folk melodies, ~I long have been away from you~ and ~Cabbage and turnips have driven me away, Had my mother cooked meat, I'd have chosen to stay~.</p><p>Glenn Gould The Goldbergs are a showpiece of keyboard virtuosity and variety. Glenn Gould brings out the flavours of them all. The pensive Aria, the cheeky 5th variation and the deeply introspective 25th Variation, that Landowska called the Black Pearl. And yes, if you turn the volume up, you can clearly hear Gould singing along, obviously enjoying himself.</p><p>As a final irony, Gould re-recorded the Goldbergs in 1981, despite rarely doubling up in recordings throughout his career. It was the same Gould, but a completely different set of Goldbergs. Slower (much slower), less fireworks but deeper and more meditative. He died from a massive stroke soon after, the two Goldberg Variation recordings pillars at each end of his creative life.</p>"

		"biography": "<p>Guitarist, educator, and historian Stefan Grossman was a student of acoustic blues and gospel singer/guitarist Rev. Gary Davis. Beginning when he was 15, Grossman studied with Davis on weekends, spending eight to ten hours at his house in Harlem, absorbing all he could. After studying with Davis for eight years in high school and college, he learned and studied with other country blues guitarists: Mississippi John Hurt, Son House, Skip James, Mance Lipscomb, and Fred McDowell. Other early influences for Grossman included Elizabeth Cotten, Sam McGee, Willie Brown, and Charley Patton.</p><p>In the early '60s, Grossman formed the Even Dozen Jug Band and worked with the political rock band the Fugs before moving to Great Britain. In 1968, he co-founded Kicking Mule Records with Ed Denson, a label that showcased idiosyncratic acoustic blues and folk guitar styles. The co-founders dissolved their partnership in the mid-'80s, but Kicking Mule's catalog was purchased by Fantasy Records. Some of the vinyl sides have seen the light of day on compact disc. From 1967 to the early '80s, Grossman lived in Great Britain, where he carved a reputation on the European blues and folk festival circuit, playing with British-raised acoustic guitarists like John Renbourn and John Fahey.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/sg-how-to-play-blues-guitar.jpg~ alt=~How to Play Blues Guitar~><p>Grossman's solo discography goes all the way back to 1966, when he recorded How to Play Blues Guitar for Elektra Records; his sessionography also includes recordings with the Even Dozen Jug Band (which also included such future luminaries as John Sebastian, Maria Muldaur, and David Grisman) as well as albums by Paul Simon, John Fahey, Charlie Musselwhite, and Happy Traum. In the early '80s, Grossman began a long relationship with Shanachie Records of Newton, NJ, recording extensively and issuing such albums as Shining Shadows (1988), Guitar Landscapes (1990), Love, Devils & the Blues (1992), Northern Skies, Southern Blues (1997), and Shake That Thing: Fingerpicking Country Blues (1998) for the label. He also helped Shanachie launch their Guitar Artistry imprint series, showcasing such artists as himself, Renbourn, and Traum. While based in northwest New Jersey, Grossman toured infrequently and concentrated his efforts on running his Vestapol instructional video business, releasing videos (many of which are now available on DVD) by guitarists ranging from Merle Travis and Chet Atkins to Dave Van Ronk and Brownie McGhee.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/sg-bermuda-triangle-exit.jpg~ alt=~Bermuda Triangle Exit~><p>During the 2000s, Grossman could be found recording in duo and trio settings (2007's Bermuda Triangle Exit with Tokio Uchida and Played a Little Fiddle with Danny Kalb and Steve Katz) and releasing the results on his Guitar Workshop label -- which also issued albums by the likes of Davy Graham, Happy Traum, and David Laibman as well as archival recordings and a number of various-artist collections. In 2006 he began touring once again, making appearances in the U.S., England, Europe, and Japan. Grossman remains one of the world's foremost authorities on acoustic blues guitar.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Richard Skelly</strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>Last Time Around -- Live At Legends is a fitting farewell to the late, great Junior Wells and his partnership, friendship and kinship with Buddy Guy that lasted decades. The album is a historic release in many ways. It reunites two blues legends who began their unique association in the 1950s. The album was recorded live in March 1993 at Buddy Guy's world-famous Chicago blues mecca Legends, and it's an acoustic document of many classic songs that made both Wells and Guy legends in their own right, such as ~She's Alright~ and ~I've Been There,~ along with other classic blues standards such as ~Hoochie Coochie Man~ and ~Key to the Highway,~ all delivered with a looseness and power that define both Guy and Wells. It also marks the last time the two ever played together.</p>&mdash; <b>Matthew Greenwald</b>"

				"review": "<p>Buddy Guy revitalized his career when he signed with Silvertone Records in the early '90s. His first album for the label, Damn Right, I've Got the Blues, was a smash success, earning critical acclaim, awards, and sales hand over fist. Prior to that record, he was a legend only among blues fans; afterward, he was a star. Although it was a bit too rock-oriented and slick for purists, Damn Right was a terrific album, setting the pace not only for Guy but for modern electric blues in the '90s. As the decade wore on, Guy continued to make albums for Silvertone, some of them a little complacent, others quite excellent. Buddy's Baddest: The Best of Buddy Guy attempts to summarize those years in 14 songs, including three previously unreleased cuts. Not surprisingly, the compilers favor the Guy of Damn Right, featuring four songs from the record and three from its soundalike sequel, Feels Like Rain. Only two tracks from Slippin' In, his hardest blues record for the label, made the cut, while the fine live album Live! The Real Deal and the misguided Heavy Love are represented by a track apiece. In other words, a lot of good stuff remains on the original albums, which is doubly unfortunate since the three unreleased cuts are all throwaways. By relying so heavily on two records, Buddy's Baddest doesn't wind up being an accurate portrait of Guy's Silvertone recordings. That doesn't mean it's a bad listen, since the first ten songs are all very good and quite entertaining. However, anyone who has Damn Right but wants to dig deeper into Guy's Silvertone albums may prefer to pick up Feels Like Rain, which offers more of the same crossover Chicago blues, or Slippin' In, which is the real deal.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"name": "John Hammond",
		"biography": "<p>With a career that now spans in excess of three decades, John Hammond is one of handful of white blues musicians who was on the scene at the beginning of the first blues renaissance of the mid-'60s. That revival, brought on by renewed interest in folk music around the U.S., brought about career boosts for many of the great classic blues players, including Mississippi John Hurt, Rev. Gary Davis and Skip James. Some critics have described Hammond as a white Robert Johnson, and Hammond does justice to classic blues by combining powerful guitar and harmonica playing with expressive vocals and a dignified stage presence. Within the first decade of his career as a performer, Hammond began crafting a niche for himself that is completely his own: the solo guitar man, harmonica slung in a rack around his neck, reinterpreting classic blues songs from the 1930s,'40s and '50s. Yet, as several of his mid-'90s recordings for the Pointblank label demonstrate, he's also a capable bandleader who plays wonderful electric guitar. This guitar-playing and ensemble work can be heard on Found True Love and Got Love if You Want It, both for the Pointblank/Virgin label.</p><p>Born November 13, 1942, in New York City, the son of the famous Columbia Records talent scout John Hammond, Sr., what most people don't know is that young Hammond didn't grow up with his father. His parents split when he was young, and he would see his father several times a year. He first began playing guitar while attending a private high school, and he was particularly fascinated with slide guitar technique. He saw his idol, Jimmy Reed, perform at New York's Apollo Theater, and he's never been the same since.</p><p>After attending Antioch College in Ohio on a scholarship for a year, he left to pursue a career as a blues musician. By 1962, with the folk revival starting to heat up, Hammond had attracted a following in the coffeehouse circuit, performing in the tradition of the classic country blues singers he loved so much. By the time he was just 20 years old, he had been interviewed for the New York Times before one of his East Coast festival performances, and he was a certified national act.</p><p>When Hammond was living in the Village in 1966, a young Jimi Hendrix came through town, looking for work. Hammond offered to put a band together for the guitarist, and got the group work at the Cafe Au Go Go. By that point, the coffeehouses were falling out of favor and instead the bars and electric guitars were coming in with folk-rock. Hendrix was approached there by Chas Chandler, who took him to England to record. Hammond recalls telling the young Hendrix to take Chandler up on his offer. ~The next time I saw him, about a year later, he was a big star in Europe,~ Hammond recalled in a 1990 interview. In the late '60s and early '70s, Hammond continued his work with electric blues ensembles, recording with people like Band guitarist Robbie Robertson (and other members of the Band when they were still known as Levon Helm & the Hawks), Duane Allman, Dr. John, harmonica wiz Charlie Musselwhite, Michael Bloomfield and David Bromberg.</p><p>As with Dr. John and other blues musicians who've recorded more than two dozen albums, there are many great recordings that provide a good introduction to the man's body of work. His self-titled debut for the Vanguard label has now been reissued on compact disc by the company's new owners, the Welk Music Group, and other good recordings to check out (on vinyl and/or compact disc) include I Can Tell, (recorded with Bill Wyman from the Rolling Stones), Southern Fried (1968), Sourcepoint (1970, Columbia) and his most recent string of early- and mid-'90s albums for Pointblank/Virgin Records, Got Love if You Want It, Trouble No More (both produced by J.J. Cale), and Found True Love.</p><p>He didn't know it when he was 20, and he may not realize it now, but Hammond deserves special commendation for keeping many of the classic blues songs alive. When fans see Hammond perform them, as Dr. John has observed many times with his music and the music of others, the fans often want to go back further, and find out who did the original versions of the songs Hammond now plays.</p><p>Although he's a multi-dimensional artist, one thing Hammond has never professed to be is a songwriter. In the early years of his career, it was more important to him that he bring the art form to a wider audience by performing classic -- in some cases forgotten -- songs. Now, more than 30 years later, Hammond continues to do this, touring all over the U.S., Canada and Europe from his base in northern New Jersey. Anything can happen at a John Hammond concert, and he selects tunes from his vast repertoire like buckets of water from a well.</p><p>Whether it's with a band or by himself, Hammond can do it all. Seeing him perform live, one still gets the sense that some of the best is still to come from this energetic bluesman.</p>&mdash; <b>Richard Skelly</b>",

Here is a white guy, after all, who sounds like a black blues singer and chooses -- of his own free will -- to frequently return to the repertoire of an obscure black guitarist/singer from the 1930s. At the Crossroads collects this musical meeting of the minds -- or souls -- by gathering 14 of Hammond's Johnson covers, recorded between 1965 and 1978. Like Johnson, Hammond relies mostly on solo acoustic guitar. In this way, it's easy to certify his versions of ~Come on in My Kitchen~ and ~32-20 Blues~ as the real deal, or, as a folk enthusiast would say, ~authentic.~ At the same time, renditions of ~Milkcow's Calf Blues~ and ~Stones in My Passway~ are less raw and penetrating than Johnson's, and one could easily say that Hammond's real gift is that of a popularizer of rural acoustic blues. The last four cuts include full-band takes of ~Sweet Home Chicago,~ ~When You Got a Good Friend,~ ~Judgment Day,~ and ~Rambling Blues.~ While these cuts surely won't pass the purity test, they're nonetheless lots of fun. At the Crossroads is a cross-cultural, racial, and generational document, and offers a good one-stop look at one artist's nod toward another.</p>&mdash; <b>Ronnie D. Lankford Jr.</b>"

				"review": "<p>John Hammond, Jr. fell in love with country blues in the early '60s, and he has never shaken it out of his system. Over time he has developed into a gritty guitar and harp player, and while his voice still feels like someone imitating a rustic Southern blues singer rather than actually being one (Hammond is a lifetime New Yorker, after all), he has learned to temper the hoarse overstatement in his vocals to some degree -- or maybe, after 40-plus years of albums, listeners have just gotten used to his delivery. In Your Arms Again finds Hammond working in a trio format with bassist Marty Ballou and drummer Stephen Hodges, and the result is a wonderfully loose, anxious, and ragged roadhouse sound that continually feels like it's going to steamroll right off a cliff -- which isn't a bad thing at all. Recorded in a converted church in Salina, KS, in just five days, In Your Arms Again includes the usual Hammond mix of old blues and R&B classics, including, this time around, two Ray Charles songs (~I've Got a Woman,~ ~Fool for You~), three made famous by Howlin' Wolf (~I'm Leavin' You,~ ~Moanin' for My Baby,~ and Willie Dixon's ~Evil [Is Going On]~), a Jimmy Reed song (a sturdy, loping version of ~You Got Me Crying~), and two of the album's highlights, a vicious take on John Lee Hooker's ~Serve Me Right to Suffer~ and a raggedly right shuffle try on Percy Mayfield's ~My Baby's Gone.~ Hammond also contributes two of his own songs, the title track and ~Come to Find Out,~ which are credible if unspectacular efforts. The best track here is arguably the opener, a delightfully loose and energetic romp through the traditional ~Jitterbug Swing,~ drawn, it would appear, from Bukka White's 1940 version on OKeh Records. In the end, Hammond doesn't break any new ground on In Your Arms Again, but the stripped-down trio format he uses here gives the album a nice back-porch rustic stomp feel, and if he stills seems like more of an imitator than an interpreter, well, he's going to get folks moving and shaking with this little combo, and that, first and foremost, is what the blues is supposed to do. The rest is academic.</p>&mdash; <b>Steve Leggett</b>"

Herbie Hancock performs a set of tunes which include numbers from the likes of Peter Gabriel, Stevie Wonder, Sade, Paul Simon, Prince, the Beatles (~Norwegian Wood~) and Kurt Cobain. However by adding vamps, reharmonizing the chord structures, sometimes quickly discarding the melodies and utilizing an all-star band, Hancock was able to transform the potentially unrewarding music into creative jazz. Hancock, who sticks to acoustic piano, shows that he is still in prime form, taking quite a few fiery solos. With Michael Brecker on tenor and surprisingly effective soprano, guitarist John Scofield, bassist Dave Holland, drummer Jack DeJohnette and percussionist Don Alias (along with an occasional horn or string section that was dubbed in later), the results are often quite hard-swinging and certainly never predictable. Although it is doubtful that any of these songs will ever become a jazz standard, Herbie Hancock has successfully created a memorable set of ~new~ music. Well worth investigating.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b></p>"

This team-up works, and Common's prose style is exemplary in his choice of words and inspiring atmosphere. As one of the ladies who sings with the band, Grammy-winning Erykah Badu presents a valuable addition to the literature of hip-hop and jazz on several levels.

		"biography": "<p>Combining shuddering, groove-laden funky soul and folky, handcrafted acoustics, singer/songwriter Ben Harper cultivated a cult following during the course of the '90s that gained full fruition toward the end of the decade. Harper combined elements of classic singer/songwriters, blues revivalists, Jimi Hendrix, and '90s jam bands like Blues Traveler, Hootie & the Blowfish, and Phish, which meant that he was embraced by critics and college kids alike. Though he never had a hit album, his body of work sold consistently and he toured constantly, building a solid, dedicated fan base.</p><p>A native of California, Harper grew up listening to blues, folk, soul, R&B, and reggae. As a child, he started playing guitar, and began to perform regularly as a preteen. During his adolescence, he began playing acoustic slide guitar, which would eventually become his signature instrument. After steady gigging in the Los Angeles area, Harper scored a deal with Virgin Records in 1992. He released his debut album, <i>Welcome to the Cruel World</i>, two years later to positive reviews.</p><p>Released in 1995, the politically-heavy <i>Fight for Your Mind</i> made for a strong sophomore effort, an obvious growth in musical experimentation and individual declamation. Harper's third album, 1997's <i>The Will to Live</i>, pushed his blues-oriented alternative folk into the middle mainstream, becoming a mainstay at college radio and making inroads at adult alternative radio. Recorded over two years of touring in support of <i>Fight for Your Mind</i>, <i>The Will to Live</i> introduced the Innocent Criminals, Harper's supporting band. The Innocent Criminals -- who are bassist Juan Nelson, drummer Dean Butterworth, and percussionist David Leach -- solidified Harper's musical rhythms and emotional diversity.</p><p>Aside from working on his own material, Ben Harper has built a strong rapport with other artists, playing guest spots on records by Beth Orton, John Lee Hooker, and Government Mule. He played 1997's and 1999's Tibetan Freedom Concerts, and opened for R.E.M., Radiohead, Metallica, Pearl Jam, and the Fugees. Harper's career gained momentum throughout 1998-1999. His most successful album thus far, 1999's <i>Burn to Shine</i> blended Harper's fondness of '20s jazz compositions and urban beatboxing, resulting in a clever and passionate collection of songs. ~Steal My Kisses~ and ~Suzie Blue~ were radio favorites, landing him two headlining world tours and an opening spot on the Dave Matthews Band's summer trek of 2000. In spring 2001, Harper issued <i>Live from Mars</i>, a double disc of live electric and acoustic material spanning the previous year's tour and including covers of material by Led Zeppelin, the Verve, and Marvin Gaye.</p><p>When it came to recording his fifth studio effort, Harper went back to his drawing board of life's pleasure and pain. He'd circled the world countless times and naturally, he brashly sang about it on the worldbeat-inspired <i>Diamonds On the Inside</i>, which appeared in March 2003. After a European tour withthe Blind Boys of Alabama in 2004, the two acts entered the studio together and laid down ten tracks in two different sessions at Capitol Records basement stuidios. The resulting collaborative album issued under both names, <i>There Will Be a Light</i>, was released in September of 2004.</p>&mdash; <b>MacKenzie Wilson</b>",

His fragile acoustics have been thrown into a massive guitar storm on disc one, a thunderous combination of his signature folky blues-funk rock & roll. He's soulful and approachable on ~Excuse Me Mr.~ and ~Burn One Down,~ but he reaches for something tangible on Marvin Gaye's ~Sexual Healing.~ The vibe is calm and cool while Harper's vocals scale between a sweet falsetto and a rugged twang. ~Faded~ exudes Harper's electric twitching, and its perfection swaggers into a riveting cover of Led Zeppelin's ~Whole Lotta Love~ for a near ten-minute car crash of pure rollicking.</p><p>He switches from his electric to an acoustic for disc two, making his informality even more enticing. ~Waiting on an Angel~ is delicate, similar to the likes of Jeff Buckley, but it's the beauty of the Verve's ~The Drugs Don't Work~ that truly captures the standard of excellence that Harper depicts as a performer. Acoustically, he's honored and such praise is deserved. He's practically flawless. He's a modest artist, and such humility is found among his songs.

From the Marley-esque vibe of ~With My Own Two Hands~ to the African soundscapes of Ladysmith Black Mambazo on ~Picture of Jesus,~ Harper's purist presentation is smooth. ~When It's Good~ gives a little country blues twang, while ~Touch From You Lust~ is a sexy haze of writhing riffs. ~Temporary Remedy~ follows the funk Lenny Kravitz-style, and Harper's a bit campy. It's a noticeable change from his typically serious stature and a nice shift in personality, too. <i>Diamonds on the Inside</i> is another stunning effort from one of rock's underground heroes. Harper has consistently worked with what appeals to him musically for nearly a decade, ignoring what fits the mainstream. <i>Diamonds on the Inside</i> is Harper's sixth chapter of truth and just one listen to the electric blaze of ~Everything~ will convince you.</p>&mdash; <b>MacKenzie Wilson</b>"

				"review": "<p>Ben Harper's history with the Blind Boys of Alabama has been an evolving one that has moved from being a guest on their landmark <i>Higher Ground</i> offering and touring with them in Europe, to the Blind Boys joining Ben and the Innocent Criminals on-stage at the front and back of the show. This album began as a series of rehearsals for collaboration on a Blind Boys of Alabama record. Recorded in two sessions, the vibe in the room was loose and creative enough that the two acts ended up with an album of collaborative material for joint release. And this is a collaboration in the truest sense of the word. It's not just Ben playing gospel, or the Blind Boys of Alabama singing on a Ben Harper record. These ten tunes -- with seven Harper originals written specifically for the sessions, the rest traditional gospel tunes and covers -- showcase Harper and the Innocent Criminals alongside the Blind Boys of Alabama.</p><p>The album kicks off with Harper's ~Take My Hand,~ a funky gospel tune that showcases a Fender Rhodes and Harper's wah-wah pedal underscored by the call and response of the Blind Boys repeating the title after each sung line of the verse, before Clarence Fountain takes it out. ~Wicked Man~ is a Southern soul tune that has a Muscle Shoals groove and a beautiful vocal weave on the refrain. ~Church House Steps~ is pure gospel groove with a Hammond B3 and a smoking duet between the Blind Boys' layered harmonies and Harper on the verses with full-on blues feel in his singing and playing. There's a killer cover of the Bob Dylan/Danny O'Keefe tune, ~Well, Well, Well,~ with Delta blues bottleneck shimmering through the intertwined vocal lines. The deep, nocturnal sparseness of ~Satisfied Mind~ is a complete re-reading of the nugget with a swampy backbeat. And this album works beautifully. Nothing sounds forced, all of it loose and comfortable and the vocal performances on both sides are simply stellar. Highly recommended.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

				"review": "<p>After seven albums and 12 years in the game, it can stop being said that Ben Harper is hard to categorize, because at this point, the fact that he always incorporates diverse elements — from folk to hard rock to funk — into his music and makes something very much his own is a given. He's practically created a genre. So maybe that's why it's so surprising that Both Sides of the Gun, a two-disc album, has little of that very thing that makes him so unique. Instead, he chooses to show off the range of his musical interests, and ends up with something closer to a compilation than a Ben Harper album.<p><p>The softer, acoustically based disc is full of pretty love songs and sweetly strummed guitars, and though Harper has done this before and kept his own style intact (in ~Two Hands of a Prayer~ and ~When She Believes,~ for example), here he comes off sounding a bit boring. He hasn't forgotten himself completely: both ~Never Leave Lonely Alone~ and ~Crying Won't Help You Now~ are good songs, sounding strongly of him while also experimenting with other styles (Latin/French and gospel, respectively), but almost all the other tracks could have been pulled off any run-of-the-mill singer/songwriter album from the past ten years. Things improve slightly on the other, louder, disc (~Please Don't Talk About Murder While I'm Eating~ is all electric blues, complete with a distorted slide guitar solo, and ~Serve Your Soul~ is the most Harper-ish of everything, blending folk guitar, pure rock, raw blues, and socially conscious lyrics into one eight-minute masterpiece), but there's still that sampler-record feeling there. ~Engraved Invitation~ and ~Get It Like You Like It~ are heavily influenced by the Rolling Stones, ~Both Sides of the Gun~ alludes to Curtis Mayfield and James Brown, and ~Better Way~ is practically a tribute (at least musically) to Prince's ~7.~ Harper has always borrowed from other artists, but he's also always added enough of himself to make it not quite so...blatant. It's not that he isn't able to perform such a diverse selection: there are plenty of excellent cuts and most of the album is quite good.</p><p>Harper is a fantastically talented musician, and he has really developed his voice since Diamonds on the Inside and is unafraid to do things with it, going from a croon to a scream and always sounding great. But why he's copying other people's styles instead of building on his own is both odd and disappointing, because he's always been able to experiment before while also preserving his individuality. If in Both Sides of the Gun Harper is trying to show his audience what a wide variety of music he can cover, he certainly accomplishes that. But if he's trying to create an album that is really about him, he doesn't quite deliver. Ben Harper is in there, don't worry, but he can be a little hard to find.</p>"

				"review": "<p>As it's played out on his recordings, the very gift that has been such a boon to Ben Harper has also been his bane: his musical restlessness and the wide range of styles he seems to employ. It's obvious, and has been since his sophomore offering, Fight for Your Mind, that Harper is not only a master guitarist but a fine songwriter and a great showman. He's been under the sway of legends like Marley, Hendrix, Dylan, Redding, and to a lesser extent, Havens. On his recordings he's wrapped them all up together continually, creating an identity forged on that diversity. That said, as a result, the albums have often suffered. In a live context that shape-shifting mélange can be &mdash; and more often than not is &mdash; seamless and utterly exciting. In the studio it doesn't gel so easily. His last studio record, Both Sides of the Gun in 2006, attempted a narrower, albeit mellower focus; but he spread it over two discs! The desire to concentrate on a single identity &mdash; as a singer/songwriter &mdash; resulted in a less than optimal, sometimes even boring, result; a single disc would have been more easily swallowed. Perhaps this is why his most satisfying and consistent offering is arguably his collaboration with the Blind Boys of Alabama on There Will Be a Light from 2004 &mdash; until now. Ben Harper &amp; the Innocent Criminals entered Gang Studio in Paris in November of 2006, immediately after finishing a nine-month world tour that ended with eight weeks in Europe. They loaded in their gear, rehearsed, and recorded directly to analog tape &mdash; i.e., without the aid of computers or Pro Tools &mdash; and mixed in seven days. The result is a deeply focused, loose, and laid-back record that is musically compelling and deeply soulful, and contains some of Harper's finest songs to date. At this time, the Innocent Criminals are drummer Oliver Charles, percussionist Leon Mobley, Juan Nelson on bass, guitarist Michael Ward, and Jason Yates plays keyboards, with a pair of backing vocalists, Michelle Haynes and Rovleta Fraser. Clocking in at just over 40 minutes, this is a brief record for Harper, but it serves him well. The music is a seamless meld of soulful folk, gospel, countryish rock, and blues. The operative genre here, however, is the rootsy soul that Harper could always sing, and Ward's fills along with the electric Wurlitzer, acoustic pianos, and Hammond B-3 employed by Yates make it all swing, while the steady yet slippery percussion roots the music deeply in the groove, which is mellow but tough.</p><p>The proof begins on ~Fight Outta You,~ the album's opening track. Harper's acoustic plays the first couple of bars before the rest of the band kicks in, establishing a country-soul feel. His lyrics are uplifting, full of determination and hope. This is underscored by the next number, ~In the Colors,~ which bleeds Southern soul and a killer reggae bassline bubbling underneath. The theme of hope is right there, propping the first track by underscoring in poetic terms the true, just, and beautiful. ~Fool for a Lonesome Train,~ a backwoods country-rock tune, is maybe the strongest cut on the set; its high lonesome sound is borne out not just in the grain of Harper's vocal but by the band's unobtrusive yet utterly engaging support. The lyrics are there; they have the wild and restless in them but it takes a group effort to make restraint an art, underscoring the blood and sinew in Harper's words. That's not to say there are no ~rockers~ on the set. ~Needed You Tonight~ comes right out of the shouting gospel and electric blues with electric guitars blazing; it alternates its dynamic between that vibe and sweet soul. ~Having Wings~ is a gorgeous follow-up, with acoustic piano and electric guitars flowing under Harper's voice.</p><p>~Say You Will~ is a seriously uptempo gospel shouter, but far more carnal. It's an ass-shaker with smoking piano and percussion work and lots of breakbeats tossed in by Charles; that backing chorus takes it out of Sunday morning and places it in the heart of Saturday night. ~Put It on Me~ is more of a guitar take on the same kind of music. With the chorus and those six-strings all edgy and loose, it's funky, dirty, and gets very close to nasty. ~Heart of Matters~ gets back to back-porch soul before giving way to a Weissenborn guitar solo on ~Paris Sunrise #7,~ before closing with the lone acoustic guitar and vocal ballad on the title cut. The set could have gone out on one of the more uptempo tunes after the instrumental, but it's a small complaint in this mix. Whether or not you prefer the rowdier version of Harper and his band, it is inarguable that this recording is a concentrated effort coming down on the side of a couple of musical notions that weave together artfully and meaningfully. This is a very informal-sounding record, and one that feels comfortable in showing its unvarnished side, its seams. And given that it was recorded completely in analog, fans would be well advised to pick up vinyl copies as well and compare the two; the prediction is most likely the vinyl sounds fuller and warmer.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>While it's always been true that Ben Harper has been a musically restless soul with a penchant for changing up his groove from album to album, most of them have been recorded with his longtime unit the Innocent Criminals. As a result, both live and in the studio, a particular vibe existed. Familiarity breeds that, and it also sets up a dynamic. For White Lies for Dark Times, Harper put the Innocent Criminals on hiatus and hooked up with a new group: three Austin, TX transplants to Los Angeles called Relentless7, comprised of guitarist Jason Mozersky, bassist Jesse Ingalls, and drummer Jordan Richardson. The end result is, to say the least, explosive. While it's true that this 11-track collection does have some beautiful acoustic balladry on it, and a touch of Harper's brand of soul in its grooves, most of what we find here is balls out Rock with a potent dose of ragged, modern Texas blues thrown in. Indeed this may be the most electric sounding recording Harper has ever issued. He co-wrote six of the tracks with his bandmates, and those he wrote himself have been arranged and/or written to be played with this band. It's in the mix from the opener, ~Number with No Name,~ the slow slide guitar playing an electric blues stomp that's pure Harper, but the drums are pure thud and whomp rather than snap and crackle. The bassline is enormous and the second guitar matches both volume and nastiness with that slide. In other words, this sounds like a band playing this jam, not Harper and his band. One can hear traces of Jimi Hendrix, early ZZ Top, and Johnny Winter in the attack, but it's pure rocking blues thunder and lightning spit out via Texas and the Delta.</p><p>The more spacy rock of ~Up to You Now~ is more directly a ~Harper~ tune with its stretched rhythmic sense and soulful vocal, but the utterly popping bass and wooly distorted guitar mix move it beyond his sensitive singer/songwriter frame. ~Shimmer & Shine,~ the set's first single, begins as a double-timed rocker with Richarsdon's drum break, but kicks in with a staggered set of power chords that blend angsty punk and anthemic rock. ~Why Must You Always Dress in Black~ is pure blues-rock venom, the overdriven distortion (engineer and co-producer Danny Kalb did a brilliant job on this set, and on this track in particular) makes the guitars sound like they're breathing fire. The scattershot breaks from Richardson are impressive, especially as underscored with a syncopated bass pattern that marries blues, rock, and funk by Ingalls. Harper's slide chops -- especially when matched against that screaming blues riff of Mozersky's -- marks the toughest cut on the set. And that's saying something, because there isn't a throwaway here. Whether it's the shimmering, gospel-tinged balladry of ~Skin Thin,~ the crunchy wah-wah electric funk-rock of ~Keep It Together (So I Can Fall Apart),~ the tripped out voodoo-psych, percussion-driven skronk that is ~Boots Like These,~ or the straight up gorgeous, midtempo soul-rock ballad ~Faithfully Remain,~ that closes the set on an uplifting (if reserved) note; it's all inspired and executed flawlessly. And while it's true that many of the tunes have lyrics that reflect anger, disillusionment, and sometimes bitterness, the snarling yet joyous attack in the music balances them. This is the record that finally matches the excitement Harper generates in a live setting and is not to be missed.</p><strong>&mdash; Thom Jurek</strong>"

				"review": "<p>After the sidestep trio with Dhani Harrison and Joseph Arthur in A Fistful of Mercy, a trio that netted the all-too-sleepy As I Call You Down, guitar hero Ben Harper reconvenes his Relentless7 bandmates -- Jason Mozersky, guitar; Jesse Ingalls, bass and keys; and Jordan Richardson, drums -- for Give Till It's Gone. The 11-song set runs the gamut of Harper's many styles. There are midtempo rockers such as the intimate first-person confessional ~Don't Give Up on Me Now,~ which examines the distance between what a man aspires to be and what he actually is. The title of ~I Will Not Be Broken~ may be anthemic, but the song is a moody -- bordering on angry -- minor-key waltz that melds acoustic and electric guitars, keyboards, and muffled percussion in an atmospheric blanket. Harper gets his volume on in the lyrically mindless but harder psych rock of ~Rock n' Roll Is Free.~ While he claims the song was inspired by Neil Young, it doesn't live up to his muse's reckless knife-edged example. Ringo Starr makes two appearances here, as co-writer and drummer on the over-produced Beatlesque ~Spilling Faith,~ which gives way to a much more interesting instrumental addendum called ~Get There from Here,~ allowing the Relentless7, Harper, and Starr to really cut loose and play. It's dissonant, ragged and woolly, and drenched in noisy, blown-out production. Harper's moving ~Pray That Our Love Sees the Dawn~ is a midtempo ballad that features Jackson Browne's inimitable harmony vocals, adding the necessary depth to a lyric that reveals the aforementioned distance between the man in the mirror and the one looking at him. Harper allows his soul groove voice in ~Waiting on a Sign,~ which in turn gives way to the screaming '90s-centric funk-rock of ~Dirty Little Lover,~ with slide guitars ablaze. He's best in the louder numbers mentioned above, the stomping dissonant syncopation in ~Clearly Severely,~ and ~Do It for You, Do It for Us.~ The latter is the album's closing track; it walks a stiletto's edge between melodic psychedelia and stomping heavy rock. While nowhere near as focused as 2009's White Lies for Dark Times, Give Till It's Gone does possess moments when all of Harper's gifts as a writer and guitarist are evidently clear.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"name": "Emmylou Harris",
		"biography": "<p>Though other performers sold more records and earned greater fame, few left as profound an impact on contemporary music as Emmylou Harris. Blessed with a crystalline voice, a remarkable gift for phrasing, and a restless creative spirit, she traveled a singular artistic path, proudly carrying the torch of ~Cosmic American music~ passed down by her mentor, Gram Parsons. With the exception of only Neil Young — not surprisingly an occasional collaborator — no other mainstream star established a similarly large body of work as consistently iconoclastic, eclectic, or daring; even more than three decades into her career, Harris' latter-day music remained as heartfelt, visionary, and vital as her earliest recordings.</p><p>Harris was born on April 2, 1947, to a military family stationed in Birmingham, AL. After spending much of her childhood in North Carolina, she moved to Woodbridge, VA, while in her teens, and graduated high school there as class valedictorian. After winning a dramatic scholarship at the University of North Carolina, she began to seriously study music, learning to play songs by Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. Soon, Harris was performing in a duo with fellow U.N.C. student Mike Williams, eventually quitting school to move to New York, only to find the city's folk music community dying out in the wake of the psychedelic era.</p><p>Still, Harris remained in New York, traveling the Greenwich Village club circuit before becoming a regular at Gerdes Folk City, where she struck up friendships with fellow folkies Jerry Jeff Walker, David Bromberg, and Paul Siebel. After marrying songwriter Tom Slocum in 1969, she recorded her debut LP, 1970's <i>Gliding Bird</i>. Shortly after the record's release, however, Harris' label declared bankruptcy, and while pregnant with her first child, her marriage began to fall apart. After moving to Nashville, she and Slocum divorced, leaving Harris to raise daughter Hallie on her own. After several months of struggle and poverty, she moved back in with her parents, who had since bought a farm outside of Washington, D.C.</p><p>There she returned to performing, starting a trio with local musicians Gerry Mule and Tom Guidera. One evening in 1971, while playing at an area club called Clyde's, the trio performed to a crowd which included members of the country-rock pioneers the Flying Burrito Brothers. In the wake of the departure of Gram Parsons, the band's founder, the Burritos were then led by ex-Byrd Chris Hillman, who was so impressed by Harris' talents that he considered inviting her to join the group. Instead, Hillman himself quit to join Stephen Stills' Manassas, but he recommended her to Parsons, who wanted a female vocalist to flesh out the sound of his solo work, a trailblazing fusion of country and rock & roll he dubbed ~Cosmic American music.~ Their connection was instant, and soon Harris was learning about country music and singing harmony on Parsons' solo debut, 1972's GP. A tour with Parsons' backup unit the Fallen Angels followed, and in 1973 they returned to the studio to cut his landmark LP, Grievous Angel.</p><p>On September 19, just weeks after the album sessions ended, Parsons' fondness for drugs and alcohol finally caught up to him, and he was found dead in a hotel room outside of the Joshua Tree National Monument in California. At the time, Harris was back in Washington, collecting her daughter for a planned move to the West Coast. Instead, she remained in D.C., reuniting with Tom Guidera to form the Angel Band. The group signed to Reprise and relocated to Los Angeles to begin work on Harris' solo major-label debut, 1975's acclaimed <i>Pieces of the Sky</i>, an impeccable collection made up largely of diverse covers ranging in origin from Merle Haggard to the Beatles. Produced by Brian Ahern, who would go on to helm Harris' next ten records — as well as becoming her second husband — <i>Pieces of the Sky's</i> second single, a rendition of the Louvin Brothers' ~If I Could Only Win Your Love,~ became her first Top Five hit. ~Light of the Stable,~ a Christmas single complete with backing vocals from Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Neil Young, soon followed; Harris then repaid the favor by singing on Ronstadt's ~The Sweetest Gift~ and Young's ~Star of Bethlehem.~</p><p>For her second LP, 1976's <i>Elite Hotel</i>, Harris established a new backing unit, the Hot Band, which featured legendary Elvis Presley sidemen James Burton and Glen D. Hardin as well as a young songwriter named Rodney Crowell on backup vocals and rhythm guitar. The resulting album proved to be a smash, with covers of Buck Owens' ~Together Again~ and the Patsy Cline perennial ~Sweet Dreams~ both topping the charts. Before beginning sessions for her third effort, 1977's <i>Luxury Liner</i>, Harris guested on Bob Dylan's <i>Desire</i> and appeared in Martin Scorsese's documentary of the Band's legendary final performance, <i>The Last Waltz</i>. <i>Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town</i> followed in 1978, led by the single ~Two More Bottles of Wine,~ her third number one. The record was Crowell's last with the Hot Band; one of the tracks, ~Green Rolling Hills,~ included backing from Ricky Skaggs, soon to become Crowell's replacement as Harris' vocal partner.</p><p>1979's <i>Blue Kentucky Girl</i> was her most country-oriented work to date, an indication of what was to come a year later with <i>Roses in the Snow</i>, a full-fledged excursion into acoustic bluegrass. In the summer of 1980, a duet with Roy Orbison, ~That Lovin' You Feelin' Again,~ hit the Top Ten; a yuletide LP, <i>Light of the Stable: The Christmas Album</i>, followed at the end of year, at a time during which Harris had quit touring to focus on raising her second daughter, Meghann. Evangeline, a patchwork of songs left off of previous albums, appeared in 1981. Shortly after, Skaggs left the Hot Band to embark on a solo career; his replacement was Barry Tashian, a singer/songwriter best known for fronting the 1960s rock band the Remains.</p><p>In 1982, drummer John Ware, the final holdover from the first Hot Band lineup, left the group; at the same time, Harris' marriage to Ahern was also beginning to disintegrate. After 1981's Cimarron, Harris and the Hot Band cut a live album, <i>Last Date</i>, named in honor of the album's chart-topping single ~(Lost His Love) On Our Last Date,~ a vocal version of the Floyd Cramer instrumental. Quickly, they returned to the studio to record <i>White Shoes</i>, Harris' final LP with Ahern at the helm. Her most far-ranging affair yet, it included covers of Donna Summer's ~On the Radio,~ Johnny Ace's ~Pledging My Love,~ and Sandy Denny's ~Old-Fashioned Waltz.~</p><p>After leaving Ahern, she and her children moved back to Nashville. There, Harris joined forces with singer/songwriter Paul Kennerley, on whose 1980 concept album <i>The Legend of Jesse James</i> she had sung backup. Together, they began formulating a record called <i>The Ballad of Sally Rose</i>, employing the pseudonym Harris often used on the road to veil what was otherwise a clearly autobiographical portrait of her own life. Though a commercial failure, the 1985 record proved pivotal in Harris' continued evolution as an artist and a risk taker; it also marked another chapter in her personal life when she and Kennerley wed shortly after concluding their tour. <i>Angel Band</i>, a subtle, acoustic collection of traditional country spirituals, followed, although the record was not issued until 1987, after the release of its immediate follow-up, <i>Thirteen</i>.</p><p>Harris, Dolly Parton, and Linda Ronstadt had first toyed with the idea of recording an album together as far back as 1977, only to watch the project falter in light of touring commitments and other red tape. Finally, in 1987, they issued <i>Trio</i>, a collection which proved to be Harris' best-selling album to date, generating the hits ~To Know Him Is to Love Him~ (a cover of the Phil Spector classic), ~Telling Me Lies,~ and ~Those Memories of You.~ The record's success spurred the 1990 release of <i>Duets</i>, a compilation of her earlier hits in conjunction with George Jones, Willie Nelson, Gram Parsons, and others. Fronting a new band, the Nash Ramblers, in 1992 she issued <i>At the Ryman</i>, a live set recorded at Nashville's legendary Ryman Auditorium, the former home of the Grand Ole Opry. At the time of the record's release, Harris was also serving a term as President of the Country Music Foundation.</p><p>In 1993, she ended her long association with Warner Bros./Reprise to move to Asylum Records, where she released <i>Cowgirl's Prayer</i> shortly after her separation from Paul Kennerley. Two years later, at a stage in her career at which most performers retreat to the safety of rehashing their greatest hits again and again, Harris issued <i>Wrecking Ball</i>, perhaps her most adventuresome record to date. Produced by Daniel Lanois, the New Orleans-based artist best known for his atmospheric work with U2, Peter Gabriel, and Bob Dylan, Wrecking Ball was a hypnotic, staggeringly beautiful work comprised of songs ranging from the Neil Young-penned title track (which featured its writer on backing vocals) to Jimi Hendrix's ~May This Be Love~ and the talented newcomer Gillian Welch's ~Orphan Girl.~</p><p>A three-disc retrospective of her years with Warner Bros., <i>Portraits</i>, appeared in 1996, and in 1998 Harris resurfaced with <i>Spyboy</i>. Following the release of <i>Trio II</i> later that year, she and Ronstadt again reunited, this time minus Parton, for 1999's <i>Western Wall: Tucson Sessions</i>. Harris returned the following year with <i>Red Dirt Girl</i>, her first album of original material in five years, which featured appearances from Bruce Springsteen, Patty Scialfa, Jill Cuniff, and Patty Griffin.</p>&mdash; <b>Jason Ankeny</b>    ",

		"lastname": "Harrison",
		"name": "George Harrison",
		"biography": "<p>As lead guitarist for the Beatles, George Harrison provided the band with a lyrical style of playing in which every note mattered. Harrison was one of millions of young Britons inspired to take up the guitar by British skiffle king Lonnie Donegan's recording of ~Rock Island Line.~ But he had more dedication than most, and with the encouragement of a slightly older school friend — Paul McCartney — he advanced quickly in his technique and command of the instrument. Harrison developed his style and technique slowly and painstakingly over the several years, learning everything he could from the records of Carl Perkins, Duane Eddy, Chet Atkins, Buddy Holly, and Eddie Cochran. By age 15, he was allowed to sit in with the Quarry Men, the Liverpool group founded by John Lennon, of which McCartney was a member; by 16, he was a full-fledged member of the group.</p><p>The Beatles finally coalesced around Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and drummer Ringo Starr in 1962, with Harrison established on lead guitar. The Beatlemania years, from 1963 through 1966, were a mixed blessing for Harrison. The Beatles' studio sound was generally characterized by very prominent rhythm guitar parts, and on many of the Beatles' early songs, Harrison's lead guitar was buried beneath the chiming chords of Lennon's instrument. Additionally, he was thwarted as a songwriter by the presence of Lennon and McCartney; the quality and proliferation of their output left very little room on the group's albums for songs by anyone else. Despite these problems, Harrison grew markedly as a musician between 1963 and 1966, writing a handful of good songs and one classic (~If I Needed Someone~), and also making his first acquaintance of the sitar, an Indian instrument whose sound fascinated him.</p><p>In 1966, Harrison finally seemed to find his voice with two of his songs on the <i>Revolver</i> album, ~Taxman~ and ~Love You Too.~ In the wake of the group's decision to stop touring, Harrison's playing and songwriting grew exponentially. The period from 1968 onward was Harrison's richest with the Beatles. He displayed a smooth, elegant slide guitar technique that showed up on their last three albums; and he contributed two classic songs, ~While My Guitar Gently Weeps~ and ~Here Comes the Sun,~ along with ~Something,~ which became the first Harrison song on the A-side of a Beatles single.</p><p>Although never known as a strong singer, Harrison's vocals were always distinctive, especially when placed in the right setting; for his first solo record following the group's 1970 breakup, <i>All Things Must Pass</i>, Harrison collaborated with producer Phil Spector, whose so-called ~Wall of Sound~ technique adapted well to Harrison's voice. <i>All Things Must Pass</i> and the accompanying single ~My Sweet Lord~ had the distinction of being the first solo recordings by any of the Beatles to top the charts following their breakup. Unfortunately, Harrison was later successfully sued by the publisher of the 1962 Chiffons hit ~He's So Fine,~ which bore a striking resemblance to ~My Sweet Lord.~</p><p>Harrison followed <i>All Things Must Pass</i> with rock's first major charity event, <i>The Concert for Bangladesh</i>, which was staged as two shows at New York's Madison Square Garden in 1971 to help raise money for aid to that famine-ravaged nation. The second of the two all-star shows was released as a movie and a live triple album. Harrison's next studio album, <i>Living in the Material World</i>, initially sold well, but its leaner, less opulent production lacked the majestic force of <i>All Things Must Pass</i>, and it lacked the earlier album's mass appeal. Subsequent Harrison albums from the 1970s into the '80s always had an audience, but — except for <i>Somewhere in England</i> (1981), released in the wake of the murder of John Lennon with the memorial song ~All Those Years Ago~ — none seemed terribly well-crafted or -executed. During this same period, Harrison embarked on a successful career as a movie producer with the founding of Handmade Films.</p><p>In 1987, Harrison made a return to the top of the charts with his album <i>Cloud Nine</i>, which featured his most inspired work in years, most notably a cover of an old Rudy Clark gospel number called ~Got My Mind Set on You,~ which reached number one on the charts. In 1988, Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and Roy Orbison formed the Traveling Wilburys, who released two very successful albums. It was also around this time that Harrison appeared with his former bandmate Ringo Starr, Dave Edmunds, Rosanne Cash, and the Stray Cats' Lee Rocker (who was born the year the Beatles made their first recordings) in a superb live-in-front-of-the-cameras rockabilly performance accompanying Harrison's one-time idol Carl Perkins; which was subsequently released on video cassette and laser disc. All of this success heralded a short-lived re-emergence for the musician out of private life, resulting in a 1991 tour of Japan that yielded a live album (<i>Live in Japan</i>). Harrison had hated concertizing since the harrowing days of the Beatles' international career, and had done one poorly received concert tour in the mid-'70s; he seemed more comfortable in 1991, and the album performed moderately well, driven by the presence of his then-recent hits.</p><p>He withdrew into private life after that, devoting himself to his life with his second wife and their son, and only re-emerged before the public when necessary, such as defending the Beatles' copyrights in court cases.</p><p>In 1999, Harrison was assaulted in his home and seriously injured by a deranged fan, but he recovered and in 2000 he began work on remastering and expanding his classic <i>All Things Must Pass</i> album. The reissue of that album at the outset of 2001 heralded an unusually public publicity campaign by Harrison, who accompanied its re-release with an interview record that anticipated the eventual reissue of the rest of his catalog. Harrison had been treated for throat cancer in the late '90s, but in 2001 it was revealed that he was suffering from an inoperable form of brain cancer. At the time of his death on November 29, 2001, The <i>Concert for Bangladesh</i> album had been announced for upgraded reissue in January of 2002, and a DVD of the film was in release internationally.</p>&mdash; <b>Bruce Eder</b>",

				"review": "<p><i>All Things Must Pass</i> has long been one of the more vexing classic albums to make it to CD. It appeared previously in two distinctly different (yet confusingly similar) packagings in the late '80s, one from England and one from America, both of which were straight reissues of the original triple LP. Neither was a wholly satisfactory release, owing to the same problems that existed on Layla by Derek & the Dominos — both albums (which have related histories) were recorded using lots of tracks (and no noise reduction technology) to achieve a very big sound, which was impressive on vinyl but had a lot of noise when processed digitally for CD. This expanded and remastered edition, released in January of 2001, solved most of those problems as well as offering five additional tracks. The remastering, done sometime in 2000, has imparted greater resolution to the music without losing the wall-of-sound effect that most of the album was intended to display. In the process, it's possible to discern the various guitars at work far better than on the original LP set, and to better appreciate the virtuosity of the playing involved as well as the sheer size of the ensemble Harrison assembled. Additionally, and almost more important in terms of enjoying the album as a whole, the new edition captures the warmth and nuances of Harrison's singing on songs like ~Let It Down,~ ~Run of the Mill,~ and ~Isn't It a Pity (Version Two).~ This improvement isn't reflected everywhere — on ~The Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp,~ for example, his voice is still buried fairly deep in the mix and not as up front as it is elsewhere, but that's how it was mastered originally, and even Harrison admits, in the notes introducing the accompanying booklet, that he had to resist the urge to remix the album.</p> <p>Of the five bonus tracks, one is an entirely new song from the original sessions, and three more are outtakes of existing songs in versions that have appeared on various bootlegs, while ~My Sweet Lord (2000)~ is a stripped-down reconsideration of the song. It doesn't add anything in particular, except to show that Harrison can still play up a storm. The so-called ~Apple Jam~ tracks that comprised disc three of the original LP have also been remastered, to their considerable advantage — the nuances of the playing on those sessions, which essentially marked the birth of Derek & the Dominos, are brought out in crisp detail and they are worth hearing, now more than ever, and that goes double for the hard-rocking, Chuck Berry-esque jam ~Thanks for the Pepperoni.~ The new edition comes in a box with each CD in a separate slipcase and a booklet containing photos from the original sessions, full lyrics, recording credits, and an essay by Harrison.</p>&mdash; <b>Bruce Eder</b>"

				"review": "<p>George Harrison went quiet not long after the second Traveling Wilburys album, surfacing only for the Beatles' <I>Anthology</I> in the mid-'90s. He was recording all the while, yet he died before completing the album that would have been the follow-up to 1987's <I>Cloud Nine</I>. His son, Dhani, and his longtime friend/collaborator Jeff Lynne completed the recordings, released late in 2002, nearly a year after George's death, as <I>Brainwashed</I>. Given its baggage it's easy to be suspicious about the merits of <I>Brainwashed</I> prior to hearing it. Posthumous efforts often feel incomplete, Harrison's albums were frequently inconsistent, and Lynne favors ornate, cinematic productions that run contrary to George's desire for this project to be simple and low key &mdash; nothing that would suggest that <I>Brainwashed</I> would be a success.</p><p> Defying all odds, <I>Brainwashed</I> isn't just a success, it's one of the finest records Harrison ever made. Yes, it doesn't achieve the splendor of <I>All Things Must Pass</I>, nor is it quite of its time like both <I>Living in the Material World</I> and <I>Cloud Nine</I> were, but it's a quiet, subtle gem, one that strikes close to the heart of Harrison's music. It's intimate, alternately insightful and cheerfully lightweight, balancing his trademark black humor with silliness and good humor. Anyone searching the album for his views on mortality &mdash; as he faced not only cancer, but an attacker that nearly took his life &mdash; will surely find it, but this is not a somber album, it is a warm album, the sound of someone enjoying life without losing his wry sense of humor. This same spirit carries over to the music, with Harrison abandoning the idea of getting a hit and simply relaxing, primarily by playing a lot of ukulele and guitar. There aren't any major songs here and perhaps a tune or two could be pegged as throwaways by the cynical, but there are no down moments and it all holds together well &mdash; better than most Harrison albums &mdash; and it's a fitting way to say goodbye, every bit as good as <I>Double Fantasy</I> and, in some respects, even sweeter. </p>&mdash; <b> Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

There are moments on Aerial Boundaries where it seems literally impossible that so much music is coming from one man and his guitar. Attacking his instrument, snapping strings, banging on the fingerboard with his right hand, Hedges plays supremely beautiful music with the technique of a deranged lunatic. It has been said that genius is at least one part madness -- although a questionable assertion in general terms -- when applied to Hedges and his music, the analogy holds. The songs on Aerial Boundaries are all beautiful and haunting in their own right; and it is this emphasis on composition over technique that makes this such an important recording. Hedges makes the breadth of his musical interest known by the inclusion of the extremely interesting electronic piece, ~Spare Change.~ Even though the liner notes assure the listener that the guitar is the origin for every sound heard, Hedges has electronically manipulated some of them to an almost unrecognizable point, yet he has still managed to create music of untarnished beauty. There is something of the music of minimalist Steve Reich's (thanked in the liner notes) in this track, as the cycling, overlapping guitar tracks are almost trance-like in their repetitiveness, yet utterly musical in their constant revelations. Aerial Boundaries is simply one of the finest acoustic guitar albums ever made, and deserves a place in the library of all serious music fans.</p>&mdash; <b>Daniel Gioffre</b>"

		"firstname": "Jimi",
		"lastname": "Hendrix",
		"name": "Jimi Hendrix",
		"biography": "<p>In his brief four-year reign as a superstar, Jimi Hendrix expanded the vocabulary of the electric rock guitar more than anyone before or since. Hendrix was a master at coaxing all manner of unforeseen sonics from his instrument, often with innovative amplification experiments that produced astral-quality feedback and roaring distortion. His frequent hurricane blasts of noise and dazzling showmanship -- he could and would play behind his back and with his teeth and set his guitar on fire -- has sometimes obscured his considerable gifts as a songwriter, singer, and master of a gamut of blues, R&B, and rock styles.</p><p>When Hendrix became an international superstar in 1967, it seemed as if he'd dropped out of a Martian spaceship, but in fact he'd served his apprenticeship the long, mundane way in numerous R&B acts on the chitlin circuit. During the early and mid-'60s, he worked with such R&B/soul greats as Little Richard, the Isley Brothers, and King Curtis as a backup guitarist. Occasionally, he recorded as a sessionman (the Isley Brothers' 1964 single ~Testify~ is the only one of these early tracks that offers even a glimpse of his future genius). But the stars didn't appreciate his show-stealing showmanship, and Hendrix was straitjacketed by sideman roles that didn't allow him to develop as a soloist. The logical step was for Hendrix to go out on his own, which he did in New York in the mid-'60s, playing with various musicians in local clubs, and joining white blues-rock singer John Hammond, Jr.'s band for a while.</p><p>It was in a New York club that Hendrix was spotted by Animals bassist Chas Chandler. The first lineup of the Animals was about to split, and Chandler, looking to move into management, convinced Hendrix to move to London and record as a solo act in England. There a group was built around Jimi, also featuring Mitch Mitchell on drums and Noel Redding on bass, that was dubbed the Jimi Hendrix Experience. The trio became stars with astonishing speed in the U.K., where ~Hey Joe,~ ~Purple Haze,~ and ~The Wind Cries Mary~ all made the Top Ten in the first half of 1967. These tracks were also featured on their debut album, Are You Experienced, a psychedelic masterwork that became a huge hit in the U.S. after Hendrix created a sensation at the Monterey Pop Festival in June of 1967.</p><p>Are You Experienced was an astonishing debut, particularly from a young R&B veteran who had rarely sung, and apparently never written his own material before the Experience formed. What caught most people's attention at first was his virtuosic guitar playing, which employed an arsenal of devices, including wah-wah pedals, buzzing feedback solos, crunching, distorted riffs, and lightning, liquid runs up and down the scales. But Hendrix was also a first-rate songwriter, melding cosmic imagery with some surprisingly pop-savvy hooks and tender sentiments. He was also an excellent blues interpreter and a passionate, engaging singer (although his gruff, throaty vocal pipes were not nearly as great an asset as his instrumental skills). Are You Experienced was psychedelia at its most eclectic, synthesizing mod pop, soul, R&B, Dylan, and the electric guitar innovations of British pioneers like Jeff Beck, Pete Townshend, and Eric Clapton.</p><p>Amazingly, Hendrix would only record three fully conceived studio albums in his lifetime. Axis: Bold as Love and the double-LP Electric Ladyland were more diffuse and experimental than Are You Experienced. On Electric Ladyland in particular, Hendrix pioneered the use of the studio itself as a recording instrument, manipulating electronics and devising overdub techniques (with the help of engineer Eddie Kramer in particular) to plot uncharted sonic territory. Not that these albums were perfect, as impressive as they were; the instrumental breaks could meander, and Hendrix's songwriting was occasionally half-baked, never matching the consistency of Are You Experienced (although he exercised greater creative control over the later albums).</p><p>The final two years of Hendrix's life were turbulent ones musically, financially, and personally. He was embroiled in enough complicated management and record company disputes (some dating from ill-advised contracts he'd signed before the Experience formed) to keep the lawyers busy for years. He disbanded the Experience in 1969, forming Band of Gypsies with drummer Buddy Miles and bassist Billy Cox to pursue funkier directions. He closed Woodstock with a sprawling, shaky set, redeemed by his famous machine-gun interpretation of ~The Star Spangled Banner.~ The rhythm section of Mitchell and Redding were underrated keys to Jimi's best work, and Band of Gypsies ultimately couldn't measure up to the same standard, although Hendrix did record an erratic live album with them. In early 1970, the Experience re-formed and disbanded again shortly afterward. At the same time, Hendrix felt torn in many directions by various fellow musicians, record company expectations, and management, all of whom had their own ideas of what Hendrix should be doing. Almost two years since Electric Ladyland, a new studio album had yet to appear, although Hendrix was recording constantly during the period.</p><p>While outside parties did contribute to bogging down Hendrix's studio work, it also seems likely that Hendrix himself was partly responsible for the stalemate, unable to form a permanent lineup of musicians, unable to decide what musical direction to pursue, unable to bring himself to complete another album despite endless jamming. A few months into 1970, Mitchell -- Hendrix's most valuable musical collaborator -- came back into the fold, replacing Miles in the drum chair, although Cox stayed in place. It was this trio that toured the world during Hendrix's final months.</p><p>It's extremely difficult to separate the facts of Hendrix's life from rumors and speculation. Everyone who knew him well, or claimed to know him well, has different versions of his state of mind in 1970. Critics have variously mused that he was going to go into jazz, that he was going to get deeper into the blues, that he was going to continue doing what he was doing, or that he was too confused to know what he was doing at all. The same confusion holds true for his death: Contradictory versions of his final days have been given by his closest acquaintances of the time. He'd been working intermittently on a new album, tentatively titled First Ray of the New Rising Sun, when he died in London on September 18, 1970, from a drug-related overdose.</p><p>Hendrix recorded a massive amount of unreleased studio material during his lifetime. Much of this (as well as entire live concerts) was issued posthumously; several of the live concerts were excellent, but the studio tapes have been the focus of enormous controversy for over 20 years. These initially came out in haphazard drabs and drubs (the first, The Cry of Love, was easily the most outstanding of the lot). In the mid-'70s, producer Alan Douglas took control of these projects, overdubbing many of Hendrix's tapes with additional parts by studio musicians. In the eyes of many Hendrix fans, this was sacrilege, destroying the integrity of the work of a musician known to exercise meticulous care over the final production of his studio recordings. Even as late as 1995, Douglas was having ex-Knack drummer Bruce Gary record new parts for the typically misbegotten compilation Voodoo Soup. After a lengthy legal dispute, the rights to Hendrix's estate, including all of his recordings, returned to Al Hendrix, the guitarist's father, in July of 1995.</p><p>With the help of Jimi's step-sister Janie, Al set up Experience Hendrix to begin to get Jimi's legacy in order. They began by hiring John McDermott and Jimi's original engineer, Eddie Kramer, to oversee the remastering process. They were able to find all the original master tapes, which had never been used for previous CD releases, and in April of 1997, Hendrix's first three albums were reissued with drastically improved sound. Accompanying those reissues was a posthumous compilation album (based on Jimi's handwritten track listings) called First Rays of the New Rising Sun, made up of tracks from the Cry of Love, Rainbow Bridge and War Heroes.</p><p>Later in 1997, another compilation called South Saturn Delta showed up, collecting more tracks from posthumous LPs like Crash Landing, War Heroes, and Rainbow Bridge (without the terrible '70s overdubs), along with a handful of never-before-heard material that Chas Chandler had withheld from Alan Douglas for all those years.</p><p>More archival material followed. Radio One was basically expanded to the two-disc BBC Sessions (released in 1998), and 1999 saw the release of the full show from Woodstock as well as additional concert recordings from Band of Gypsies shows entitled Live at the Fillmore East. 2000 saw the release of the Jimi Hendrix Experience four-disc box set, which compiled remaining tracks from In the West, Crash Landing, and Rainbow Bridge, along with more rarities and alternates from the Chandler cache.</p><p>The family also launched Dagger Records, essentially an authorized bootleg label to supply hardcore Hendrix fans with material that would be of limited commercial appeal. Dagger released several live concerts (of shows in Oakland, Ottawa, Clark University in Massachusetts, Paris, San Francisco, Woburn in Bedfordshire, and Cologne) and a collection of studio jams and demos called Morning Symphony Ideas.</p><p>Mainstream Hendrix reissue activity continued during the 2000s and 2010s, spotlighted by major live albums originally recorded at the Isle of Wight (2002), Berkeley (2003), Monterey (2007), Winterland (2011), and the Miami Pop Festival (2013). In 2010, Sony issued a four-disc set titled West Coast Seattle Boy: The Jimi Hendrix Anthology, which offered a full disc of recordings from Hendrix's time as a backing guitarist.</p><p>That same year, Legacy, an imprint of Sony, released Valleys of Neptune. The compilation contained 12 previously unreleased tracks, and was the first of further such releases. In 2013, a second compilation appeared. People, Hell and Angels again contained 12 never-before-released songs, which in this case were recorded while Hendrix was working on the follow-up to Electric Ladyland. The final release in this series was put out in 2018, and its ten unreleased tracks also featured guest appearance from Stephen Stills and Johnny Winter.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>One of the most stunning debuts in rock history, and one of the definitive albums of the psychedelic era. On Are You Experienced?, Jimi Hendrix synthesized various elements of the cutting edge of 1967 rock into music that sounded both futuristic and rooted in the best traditions of rock, blues, pop, and soul. It was his mind-boggling guitar work, of course, that got most of the ink, building upon the experiments of British innovators like Jeff Beck and Pete Townshend to chart new sonic territories in feedback, distortion, and sheer volume. It wouldn't have meant much, however, without his excellent material, whether psychedelic frenzy (~Foxey Lady,~ ~Manic Depression,~ ~Purple Haze~), instrumental freak-out jams (~Third Stone From the Sun~), blues (~Red House,~ ~Hey Joe~), or tender, poetic compositions (~The Wind Cries Mary~) that demonstrated the breadth of his songwriting talents. Not to be underestimated were the contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who gave the music a rhythmic pulse that fused parts of rock and improvised jazz. Many of these songs are among Hendrix's very finest; it may be true that he would continue to develop at a rapid pace throughout the rest of his brief career, but he would never surpass his first LP in terms of consistently high quality. The British and American versions of the album differed substantially when they were initially released in 1967; MCA's 17-song CD reissue does everyone a favor by gathering all of the material from the two records in one place, adding a few B-sides from early singles as well.</p>&mdash; <b>Richie Unterberger</b>"

They're in good, enthusiastic form as they run through early gems like ~Hey Joe,~ ~Foxy Lady,~ ~Fire,~ and ~Stone Free,~ the lack of studio polish giving these versions a loose feel. The Experience studio albums are still considerably superior to this set, but it's certainly worth acquiring by any serious Hendrix fan, not least because it has several covers that didn't make it on to the three proper Experience LPs. Several of these (~Hoochie Koochie Man,~ ~Killing Floor,~ ~Catfish Blues~) reveal his sometimes overlooked affinity for Chicago-style electric blues; there are also a couple of surprises (~Hound Dog~ and ~Day Tripper~). With good sound, it's a solid addition to the Hendrix library, demonstrating his versatility in various rock, soul, and blues styles.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

That meant access to more studio time and more sophisicated technology, but not, alas, a great deal of time to write the material. That may be why Axis isn't quite as much of a tour de force as <i>Are You Exerienced?</i>, but it's nevertheless another major effort, showing Hendrix continuing to grow, particularly in his increasing mastery of the studio and more sophisticated lyrics. Soul and R&B influences are more prominent here than on his debut, though psychedelic experimentalism ran rampant (to great effect) on ~If 6 Was 9.~ ~Spanish Castle Magic,~ ~Up From the Skies,~ ~You Got Me Floatin',~ and ~Castles Made of Sand~ all had funky grooves that gave the spiraling guitars and crunchy rhythm section a much-needed buoyancy. The best song, though, might have been the mellowest: ~Little Wing~ was Hendrix at his most delicate, and perhaps his most personal.</p>&mdash; <b>Richie Unterberger</b>"

The result was not only one of the best rock albums of the era, but also Hendrix's original musical vision at its absolute apex. When revisionist rock critics refer to him as the maker of a generation's mightiest dope music, this is the album they're referring to. But Electric Ladyland is so much more than just background music for chemical intake. Kudos to engineer Eddie Kramer (who supervised the remastering of the original two-track stereo masters for this 1997 reissue on MCA) for taking Hendrix's visions of a soundscape behind his music and giving it all context, experimenting with odd mic techniques, echo, backward tape, flanging, and chorusing, all new techniques at the time, at least the way they're used here. What Hendrix sonically achieved on this record expanded the concept of what could be gotten out of a modern recording studio in much the same manner as Phil Spector had done a decade before with his Wall of Sound. As an album this influential (and as far as influencing a generation of players and beyond, this was his ultimate statement for many), the highlights speak for themselves: ~Crosstown Traffic,~ his reinterpretation of Bob Dylan's ~All Along the Watchtower,~ ~Burning of the Midnight Lamp,~ the spacy ~1983...(A Merman I Should Turn to Be),~ and ~Voodoo Chile (Slight Return),~ a landmark in Hendrix's playing. With this double set (now on one compact disc), Hendrix once again pushed the concept album to new horizons.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Cub Koda</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Band of Gypsys was the only live recording authorized by Jimi Hendrix before his death. It was recorded and released in order to get Hendrix out from under a contractual obligation that had been hanging over his head for a couple years. Helping him out were longtime friends Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on the drums because the Experience had broken up in June of 1969, following a show in Denver. This rhythm section was vastly different from the Experience. Buddy Miles was an earthy, funky drummer in direct contrast to the busy, jazzy leanings of Mitch Mitchell. Noel Redding was not really a bass player at all but a converted guitar player who was hired in large part because Hendrix liked his hair! These new surroundings pushed Hendrix to new creative heights. Along with this new rhythm section, Hendrix took these shows as an opportunity to showcase much of the new material he had been working on. The music was a seamless melding of rock, funk, and R&B, and tunes like ~Message to Love~ and ~Power to Love~ showed a new lyrical direction as well. Although he could be an erratic live performer, for these shows, Hendrix was on -- perhaps his finest performances. His playing was focused and precise. In fact, for most of the set, Hendrix stood motionless, a far cry from the stage antics that helped establish his reputation as a performer. Equipment problems had plagued him in past live shows as well, but everything was perfect for the Fillmore shows. His absolute mastery of his guitar and effects is even more amazing considering that this was the first time he used the Fuzz Face, wah-wah pedal, Univibe, and Octavia pedals on-stage together. The guitar tones he gets on ~Who Knows~ and ~Power to Love~ are powerful and intense, but nowhere is his absolute control more evident than on ~Machine Gun,~ where Hendrix conjures bombs, guns, and other sounds of war from his guitar, all within the context of a coherent musical statement. The solo on ~Machine Gun~ totally rewrote the book on what a man could do with an electric guitar and is arguably the most groundbreaking and devastating guitar solo ever. These live versions of ~Message to Love~ and ~Power to Love~ are far better than the jigsaw puzzle studio versions that were released posthumously. Two Buddy Miles compositions are also included, but the show belongs to Jimi all the way. Band of Gypsys is not only an important part of the Hendrix legacy, but one of the greatest live albums ever.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Sean Westergaard</strong></p>"

Jimi really tried to be whittling down songs, working hard to refine things. There was a constant evolution of the content.~</p><p>Starting with ~Mannish Boy,~ a bluesy funky rocker that finds Hendrix exploring his inner Muddy Waters, the cut is also the first known recording he made with Buddy Miles (drums) and Billy Cox (Bass) in April 1969, several months before the trio officially named themselves the Band of Gypsys. ~Lover Man,~ also recorded with Cox and Miles in December 1969, is another up-tempo tune Jimi had been tinkering with since 1967's Are You Experienced but never quite managed to perfect to his satisfaction.</p><p>He lets rip on a scorching ~Hear My Train A Comin',~ backed by Mitch Mitchell (drums) and Noel Redding (bass), followed by a country-tinged rendition of ~Stepping Stone,~ the last single released during his lifetime. On Stephen Stills' ~$20 Fine~ Hendrix proves that he could easily have been a fifth member of CSNY, thanks to some very tasty guitar licks, while on ~Power of Soul~ he out-funks Funkadelic by at least a few thousand light years.</p><p>On other tracks Jimi burns the midnight amp via ~Jungle,~ a previously unreleased instrumental, along with an embryonic take of ~Sweet Angel~ (recorded in January 1968), a song inspired by a dream Jimi had of his late mother, and continued to work on until his death.</p><p>There are also recordings with Johnny Winter and previous band-mate Lonnie Youngblood, each of which places a historic spotlight on Hendrix's blues credentials.</p><p>Fans of Crosby, Stills & Nash may be fascinated to hear a nascent reading of Joni Mitchell's ~Woodstock,~ with Stephen Stills singing and Hendrix filling in the role on bass. On other tracks Jimi branches out, exploring new musical territory on the medium-tempo ballad ~Send My Love To Linda,~ and closing cut, the oft-bootlegged ~Cherokee Mist,~ a moody instrumental which sees Hendrix playing electric sitar to Mitch Mitchell's tribal beat.</p><p>Both Sides of the Sky is in no way a perfect record, nor does it definitively illustrate Hendrix's undisputed genius. But what it does offer is further insight into Jimi's seemingly unlimited potential and talent as an artist. That his music continues to inspire people to this day is a testament to his enduring brilliance.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Sacha O'Grady</strong></p><hr/></p>Both Sides Of The Sky presents 13 studio recordings including 10 which have never before been released. All but two of these studio recordings were made during a fertile period between January 1968 and 1970. Jimi's mastery and use of the studio as a proving ground for new songs resulted in a growing collection of extraordinary material. This album completes a trilogy of albums [with Valleys Of Neptune and People, Hell & Angels] presenting the best and most significant unissued studio recordings remaining in the Hendrix archive. The songs include fascinating alternate versions of ~Stepping Stone,~ ~Lover Man~ and ~Hear My Train A Comin'~ as well as recordings where Jimi is joined by special guests Johnny Winter and Stephen Stills. Both Sides Of The Sky was mixed by Eddie Kramer, the engineer for all of Hendrix's albums throughout the guitarist's lifetime, and produced by Janie Hendrix, Kramer and John McDermott.</p></p><strong>Mannish Boy</strong> - The first ever studio session by the group Hendrix would christen as his Band Of Gypsys. Hendrix, Cox & Miles shared a love for the blues as this driving, uptempo reworking of ~Mannish Boy~ by Muddy Waters makes clear.</p></p><strong>Lover Man</strong> - Just two weeks before their triumphant New Year's concerts at the Fillmore East in NYC [yielding both 1970's Band Of Gypsys and 2016's sequel Machine Gun], Hendrix gathered with Cox and Miles to cut this dynamic rendition of what had become a favorite concert staple.</p></p><strong>Stepping Stone</strong> - A totally unique take on this Hendrix favorite, with Jimi showcasing both blues and country styled licks atop a relentless, galloping beat.</p></p><strong>$20 Fine</strong> -Stephen Stills joined Jimi, Mitch Mitchell and Buddy Miles Express keyboardist Duane Hitchings at this September 1969 session. With Stephen handling lead vocals and organ, Jimi added multiple guitar parts to this rollicking Stills original.</p></p><strong>Power Of Soul</strong> - This 1970 studio session came three weeks after the Band Of Gypsys concerts at the Fillmore East. While a live version remains one of the highpoints of Band Of Gypsys, Jimi never released a studio version during his lifetime. For this album, we present the mix that Hendrix and Kramer prepared of the complete song at Electric Lady on August 22, 1970.</p></p><strong>Jungle</strong> - The influence of Curtis Mayfield can be heard here as Jimi expands on the ~Villanova Junction Blues~ theme he made famous by its inclusion in the 1970 Woodstock documentary.</p></p><strong>Things I Used To Do</strong> - Jimi is joined for this rendition of Guitar Slim's blues classic by Johnny Winter. Jimi's trademark guitar work and Winter's deft slide playing weaves in and around the foundation set by bassist Billy Cox and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young drummer Dallas Taylor.</p></p><strong>Georgia Blues</strong> - Jimi reunited with some old friends from his pre-Experience days. Lonnie Youngblood, with whom Hendrix played in R&B groups like Curtis Knight & The Squires, voiced this superb twelve bar blues neatly underpinned by Hendrix's sublime rhythm and lead guitar work.</p></p><strong>Sweet Angel</strong> - With Axis: Bold As Love only just released, Jimi immediately turned his focus to recording what would become Electric Ladyland. This gorgeous, instrumental reading of ~Angel,~, features Jimi on guitar, bass and vibraphone joined by Mitch Mitchell.</p></p><strong>Woodstock</strong> - Stephen Stills came to this session fresh from having visited Joni Mitchell, who had a new song that Stills was excited to try and record. Long before CSNY's version, Stephen, Jimi and Buddy Miles recorded this amazing rendition.</p></p><strong>Send My Love To Linda</strong> - A superb new Hendrix original composition recorded with Cox and Miles in the aftermath of their successful Band Of Gypsys performances at the Fillmore East.</p></p><strong>Cherokee Mist</strong> - Together with drummer Mitch Mitchell, Jimi created this moody, evocative original complete with his playing of a sitar to complement his traditional electric guitar.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Amazon.com</strong></p>"

Taken from shows at Winterland, The Royal Albert Hall, and from various venues in New York, Berkeley, and San Diego, the set includes hits like ~Fire,~ ~Voodoo Chile,~ and ~Hey Joe,~ as well as fine blues like ~Red House,~ ~Bleeding Heart,~ and ~Hear My Train a Comin'.~ Highlights include a definitive version of ~Little Wing~ and one of the most assured and driving versions of ~Voodoo Chile~ (these and four other stellar tracks come from what must have been an amazing concert at Winterland in the fall of '68). Another standout is ~I Don't Live Today,~ which features a fine mix of jazz-inspired soloing and various feedback and distortion ~tricks~ (tricks that figure into Hendrix's way of ~playing with the electronics,~ and which make up one of the more innovative aspects of his guitar playing). Hendrix gets adept and sympathetic support throughout from bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell (Band of Gypsies' bassist Billy Cox replaces Redding on ~Red House~ and ~Hey Joe~). With top-notch performances, consistently inspired solos, and excellent sound, this is probably the best introduction to Hendrix's live recordings.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Cook</strong></p><hr/><p><strong>01 - Fire</strong> - recorded at the Winterland Arena, San Francisco, California, USA on October 12, 1968 (1st show)</p><p><strong>02 - I Don't Live Today</strong> - recorded at San Diego Sports Arena, San Diego, California, USA on May 24, 1969</p><p><strong>03 - Red House</strong> - recorded at New York Pop, Downing Stadium, Randall's Island, New York, USA on July 17, 1970</p><p><strong>04 - Stone Free</strong> - recorded at the Royal Albert Hall, London, England on February 24, 1969</p><p><strong>05 - Are You Experienced?</strong> - recorded at the Winterland Arena, San Francisco, California, USA on October 10, 1968 (1st show)</p><p><strong>06 - Little Wing</strong> - recorded at the Winterland Arena, San Francisco, California, USA on October 12, 1968 (2nd show)</p><p><strong>07 - Voodoo Chile</strong> - recorded at the Winterland Arena, San Francisco, California, USA on October 10, 1968 (1st show)</p><p><strong>08 - Bleeding Heart</strong> - recorded at the Royal Albert Hall, London, England on February 24, 1969</p><p><strong>09 - Hey Joe</strong> - recorded at Berkeley Community Theatre, Berkeley, California, USA on May 30, 1970 (2nd show)</p><p><strong>10 - Wild Thing</strong> - recorded at the Winterland Arena, San Francisco, California, USA on October 12, 1968 (1st show)</p><p><strong>11 - Hear My Train A Comin'</strong> - recorded at the Winterland Arena, San Francisco, California, USA on October 10, 1968 (2nd show)</p><p><strong>12 - Foxey Lady</strong> - recorded at The Forum, Los Angeles, California, USA on April 26, 1969</p>"

Its main virtue is that, in contrast to Smash Hits -- the only compilation of Hendrix's work approved by the artist -- it extends its reach past 1968. The last of the tracks come from the abortive First Rays of the New Rising Sun album, left unfinished at the time of his death, and show off a more R&B and soul-oriented sound than Hendrix was generally known for -- and are worth the price of the disc by themselves. In fact, some of these cuts recall Hendrix's history with the Isley Brothers, but done his way, with the range of sounds that he was generating in 1970. The disc concludes with the obligatory live version of ~The Star Spangled Banner~ from Woodstock, which is of massive historical and cultural importance. Where it falls short is by leaving out ~Can You See Me~ and ~Remember,~ which are on Smash Hits -- it's a pity because the presence of two of those cuts (which, in fairness, can be found on Are You Experienced?) would make this compilation perfect in most respects.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Posthumous reconstructions of unfinished works are inherently dangerous, principally because even the most capable scholar or producer can only make, at best, an educated guess as to how the work in question would have been completed. Indeed, in dealing with some such pieces, you're sometimes lucky to get the work of the artist claimed (the Mozart Symphony No. 37 is a case in point -- it doesn't exist; the piece once labeled Symphony No. 37 and attributed to Mozart is now known to have been authored by Michael Haydn); and while there's no question that the songs on this CD were recorded by Jimi Hendrix, even the people who worked on the sides with him can't say which songs would have ended up on the finished version of First Rays of the New Rising Sun (assuming that he even ended up using that title for the album), or what embellishments he would have added to any of them in the course of completing them, or even if he might not have totally reconsidered such matters as tempo and approach to any of them. In the end, First Rays of the New Rising Sun is a little like any of the various ~performing editions~ of Gustav Mahler's never-completed Symphony No. 10, in that what's here is impressive, but may have little to do with what would finally have been heard by the public, had the artist lived to finish it -- we don't know if Mahler would have scored a particular passage for horns or strings, or Hendrix would have put another, different lead guitar part, or a second (or third) guitar part on to any of these songs, or added choruses, or re-thought his vocal performance? Hendrix had gone so long between albums, seemingly adrift stylistically at various times, that there's no telling exactly what direction he was finally going to end up working toward. All of that said, this is a superb album, and a worthy if very different, earthier successor to Electric Ladyland's psychedelic excursions -- the later tracks, ironically enough, cut at that album's long promised and long-delayed studio namesake -- and also show him working in some genuinely new directions. For starters, Hendrix's voice emerges here as a genuinely powerful instrument in its own right -- his voice was never as exposed in the mix of his songs as it is here; partly this is because Hendrix and engineer Eddie Kramer never finished embellishing the songs, or completed the final mixes. But whatever the reasons, the change is refreshing -- Hendrix's voice is not only powerful and expressive throughout, but a more melodic instrument than it seemed on his earlier releases; indeed, hearing these sides is a bit like listening to those middle-years Muddy Waters recordings when Chess Records had the Chicago blues legend abandon his guitar playing in favor of concentrating on his singing; the results might not be what all fans expected, but it sure sounds good, because it turns out that Hendrix had an expressive voice and was also moving his music into new areas that were stimulating him. A lot of the material here shows Hendrix, for the first time, moving his songs specifically into a black music idiom, embracing R&B and funk elements in his singing, playing, and overall sound; some of it could qualify as Hendrix's extension of his years playing with the Isley Brothers. Songs here such as ~Freedom,~ ~Izabella,~ ~Angel,~ and ~Dolly Dagger~ show him finally acknowledging that musical world that he had largely by-passed, and the closer, ~Belly Button Window,~ is one of his most successful traditional bluesy outings. The psychedelic workouts are more jam-like and experimental, and the ballads are prettier and even more dreamlike in their background soundscapes. ~Astro Man~ also captures a light moment for the artist, as he opens the guitar workout with a quote from the Mighty Mouse theme song, sotto voce beneath the guitar. And speaking of the guitar, despite the prominence of Hendrix's vocals on a lot of this album, the guitar playing is pretty much up to the standard that one would expect, if not necessarily the final versions of some of the songs. Most of the material on First Rays of the New Rising Sun surfaced among the various posthumous Hendrix LPs issued from the 1970s through the early 1990s, but a lot of it was tampered with, mostly in the form of posthumous overdubbed embellishments supervised by producer Alan Douglas -- all of that has been stripped off and the multi-track masters retrieved and restored. What he would have eventually come up with and released as his next musical statement is anyone's guess, but this gets you as close to that answer -- and that vision -- as you're ever likely to get. It is the best representation of where the songs were at the point that he died, and it's fully competitive, in terms of merits and surprises, with his trio of completed studio albums.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

It endured a post-directorial cut from Hendrix manager Mike Jeffery and, even with the insertion of some footage of period Berkeley rioting and protest, still clocked in at less than an hour. Perhaps it could have been better if more footage was prepared -- and, unfortunately, a few of the songs weren't filmed in complete versions -- but what remains is actually a pretty enjoyable and valuable document of Hendrix in concert. Just a few months prior to his death, he's backed by the reliable Mitch Mitchell on drums and newer trio mainstay Billy Cox on bass, mixing some old classics (~Purple Haze,~ ~Voodoo Child (Slight Return),~ ~I Don't Live Today~) with quite a few selections he wouldn't release on record during his lifetime (~Johnny B. Goode,~ ~Hey Baby (New Rising Sun),~ ~Lover Man,~ ~Hear My Train a Comin'~). Hendrix seems to be a little tired and fed-up on some of the footage that survives of his concerts from his final months, but that's not the case here. He seems relaxed and in a pretty good mood, even on the obligatory ~Purple Haze,~ the one song on which he really pulls out his most famed bag of tricks, like playing the guitar with his teeth. There's also ~The Star Spangled Banner,~ not destined to make the lasting impact as the version filmed for Woodstock, of course, but impressively executed here. Most video releases have an audio-only section of concert recordings from the second set of the night's performances (also available separately in standard audio as Live at Berkeley). It's unclear, though, why neither the audio nor video included any material from the first show; as a consequence, some songs in the film, like ~Hear My Train a Comin'~ and ~Johnny B. Goode,~ aren't heard on the audio-only portion.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

This Jimi Hendrix bootleg was considered special because one of its two LPs was pressed on red vinyl, while the other was pressed on blue vinyl. Perhaps the bootlegger, which called itself Collector's Edition, thought that colored vinyl would make up for inferior sound quality - and make no mistake, this double LP won't exactly win over any audiophiles. Obviously, the person who taped 'Scuse Me While I Kiss the Sky at the L.A. Forum on April 5, 1970, used a mono home recorder, making this a bootleg that only a die-hard collector would be interested in. But despite the poor sound quality, many collectors won't want to pass up Hendrix's inspired performances of such favorites as ~Foxy Lady,~ ~Purple Haze,~ ~Voodoo Chile (Slight Return),~ and ~Spanish Castle Magic.~ An extended performance of ~Room Full of Mirrors~ is excessively long-winded, but because Hendrix was such a phenomenal musician and hired such impressive sidemen, one can easily forgive his occasional excesses. It's regrettable that this bootleg has lousy sound quality, for Hendrix's set - excesses and all - is a prime example of musical genius at work.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Alex Henderson</strong></p>"

Most people assume it was Woodstock, which was a larger festival, but by the time Jimi took the stage at around 9 a.m. on Monday morning, the Woodstock crowd was down to about 25,000 stragglers. Estimated between 300,000 and 400,000, the actual crowd at Hendrix's Atlanta Pop performance was hard to pin down due to the fact that many of the festivalgoers turned up after dark, in an effort to stay out of the stifling heat of Atlanta in the summertime. The trio of Jimi, Mitch, and Billy Cox had been touring for about two and a half months solid when July 4 rolled around, and they sound really tight kicking off the show. ~Fire~ starts the set, and one immediately notices how differently Billy Cox plays it versus Noel Redding. ~Spanish Castle Magic~ has Jimi trying out some new solo ideas and he really starts feeling it on a very improvisational, extended ~Red House.~ A rare live performance of ~Room Full of Mirrors~ is followed by an absolutely incredible version of ~Hear My Train A Comin'.~ Jimi is just in amazing form as the ideas just keep coming: the entire solo is so well constructed it could almost be composed. This is a guitar performance nearly equal to ~Machine Gun~ on Band of Gypsys, and worth the price of admission by itself. After a nice version of ~Message to Love,~ things falter just a bit with Jimi blowing his vocal entrance and muffing some lyrics on ~All Along the Watchtower~ followed by a good, not great, version of ~Freedom.~ He starts finding his guitar groove again though, and by ~Hey Joe~ he's once again in excellent form. A solid version of ~Voodoo Child (Slight Return)~ leads into a really nice extended version of ~Stone Free~ with some cool new solo ideas. ~Star Spangled Banner~ is actually punctuated with real fireworks and the set closes with another new song, ~Straight Ahead.~ The music on Freedom: Atlanta Pop Festival has been available in collector's circles for some time, but it has never sounded better than it does here. Despite a brief lull mid-set, the revamped Experience turned in an exciting show on July 4, 1970, and with ~Hear My Train A Comin',~ Jimi turned in one of the greatest solos of his career.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Sean Westergaard</strong></p>"

With the box set, Janie Hendrix, Eddie Kramer and co-producer John McDermott have unearthed the mother lode.</p><p>Disc one opens with an alternate version of probably Hendrix’ most well known song, ~Purple Haze.~ From there we are taken to the fourth live performance by the newly christened Experience where Hendrix, drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding unleash killer performances of ~Killing Floor~ and ~Hey Joe.~ The disc goes on to document Hendrix' songwriting and studio prowess with stunning, somewhat raw versions of ~Foxey Lady,~ ~Third Stone From The Sun,~ ~If 6 Was 9~ and a Dylan cover that even Dylan admired, ~Like A Rolling Stone.~</p><p>Disc two sustains the momentum with sizzling renditions of ~Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band~ – at this point only three months old – and ~Burning Of The Midnight Lamp.~ On to more studio outtakes, we glimpse the Experience/Chas Chandler combination in full bloom. It’s arguable that when Chandler – the former Animal who had more or less ~discovered~ Hendrix – took the producer helm, Hendrix was at his most creative. Certainly there was a free amount of experimentation taking place as verified by the alternate takes of ~Little Wing~ and ~Bold As Love.~ The disc shuffles back and forth from studio and live tracks, much of it without Mitchell, Redding or Chandler. It is conceivable to understand that once everyone went home, Hendrix would continue to record with who ever was around. The final track captures a solitary Hendrix plucking out an elaborate production of ~Star Spangled Banner,~ months before his most celebrated translation at Woodstock.</p><p>While a revolving door of personnel continue to make appearances, the essence of Hendrix, Mitchell and Redding persists throughout disc three. Even in their final days, the band gave their all, as exhibited by smoking ~live~ versions of ~I Don’t Live Today,~ ~Little Wing,~ ~Red House,~ ~Purple Haze~ and ~Voodoo Child (Slight Return)~ – all intended for release during Hendrix’ lifetime. The disc closes with an unreleased take of ~Izabella,~ one of the first post-Experience recordings made with Billy Cox on bass.</p><p>As things wind down with disc four, Hendrix continues to excel as a guitarist, songwriter, singer and studio junkie. Hendrix floats back and fourth from basic blues to more cerebral, less frantic material. The rare Band of Gypsys studio sessions here signal a more stripped down direction. Much of the subsequent ~live~ material – with Mitchell returning to the fold – is of then-unreleased studio experimentations. By the reaction from the few hundred in Hawaii to ~Hey Baby/In From The Storm~ to over half-million at the Isle of Wight – Hendrix’ biggest audience – to a more seasoned version of ~In From The Storm,~ you’d have thought these were staples in his catalog. While the finishing touches of the studio version of ~In From The Storm~ were still being added, Hendrix strummed ~Slow Blues,~ the last session he ever recorded, and appropriately the last track on the set.</p><p>Even as the Hendrix family continues to release live concerts and odd compilations from a seemingly endless number of tapes, The Jimi Hendrix Experience Box Set, complete with an 80-page, full-color booklet, should placate even the most casual of fans. Inferior product is bound to follow while the catalog is salvaged for every last note. I could expand on the plunder of millionaire family members, but at least they’re doing the material justice. What a shame that Jimi Hendrix himself isn’t around to enjoy the fruits of his labor.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Shawn Perry</strong></p>"

Its main virtue is that, in contrast to Smash Hits -- the only compilation of Hendrix's work approved by the artist -- it extends its reach past 1968. The last of the tracks come from the abortive First Rays of the New Rising Sun album, left unfinished at the time of his death, and show off a more R&B and soul-oriented sound than Hendrix was generally known for -- and are worth the price of the disc by themselves. In fact, some of these cuts recall Hendrix's history with the Isley Brothers, but done his way, with the range of sounds that he was generating in 1970. The disc concludes with the obligatory live version of ~The Star Spangled Banner~ from Woodstock, which is of massive historical and cultural importance. Where it falls short is by leaving out ~Can You See Me~ and ~Remember,~ which are on Smash Hits -- it's a pity because the presence of two of those cuts (which, in fairness, can be found on Are You Experienced?) would make this compilation perfect in most respects.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Sean Westergaard</strong></p>"

Some tracks have rated as all-time classics (~Angel,~ ~Izabella,~ ~Drifting,~ etc.), while others should have remained in the vaults (such as the full-length albums Crash Landing and Voodoo Soup, two collections that were near-criminally touched up by then-Hendrix keeper Alan Douglas). The out of print War Heroes is one of the few consistent compilations of unreleased Hendrix, and has since been replaced by First Rays of the New Rising Sun and South Saturn Delta. Highlights include ~Beginning~ (which contains a riff almost identical to the Stones' ~Bitch~), ~Highway Chile,~ and ~Izabella,~ a track premiered on a Dick Cavett TV show a year before Hendrix's death. However, not all of the material is up to snuff, such as the nonsensical ~Three Little Bears~ and ~Midnight,~ an overty indulgent instrumental. If you're a newcomer to Hendrix, don't start here, but if you're a serious fan searching for some interesting obscurities, War Heroes is definitely worth the price.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Greg Prato</strong></p>"

Perversely for a documentary, it achieves this simply through well-chosen concert footage rather than through the insights of the various talking heads. Pete Townshend, Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, and Germaine Greer are all wheeled out to wax lyrical about their days with Jimi, but nothing is more eloquent than watching and listening to him play. From ~Hey Joe~ in grainy black and white on the Ready Steady Go TV show, classic footage of Monterey, Woodstock (yes, ~The Star-Spangled Banner~), and the Isle of Wight festivals to an acoustic 12- string rendition of ~Hear My Train a' Comin',~ Hendrix the musician speaks for himself.</p><p>But if Hendrix the musician shines through, this is not the most insightful profile of Hendrix the man. The circumstances surrounding his death, for example, are hardly touched upon (girlfriend at the time Monika Dannemann gets only a few seconds of screen time). Interview footage with Hendrix himself plus some occasionally rambling and incoherent comments from such intimates as his father, army buddies, ex-girlfriends (including Linda Keith, who ~discovered~ him in New York and brought him to England), and fellow musicians all take second place to the music itself. The most sensible quote comes from Little Richard, who proves once and for all that he's utterly bonkers when he says of Jimi's music: ~At times he made my big toes shoot up into my boot.~ </p>&mdash; <b>Mark Walker</b>"

		"name": "Daniel Hope",
		"biography": "<p>Described at one time in his publicity materials as ~the British violinist,~ as if he were the only one, Daniel Hope is at least the most versatile British violinist of the early 21st century. An advocate of contemporary music, he has also performed Beethoven and Schumann with the period-instrument ensemble Concerto Köln, recorded music inspired by Indian classical composer/performer Ravi Shankar, partnered with actor Klaus Maria Brandauer in conceptual projects involving music and the spoken word, and recorded a pair of successful albums that use the familiar music of Antonio Vivaldi as a starting point for further creative activity.</p><p>Hope's father, poet and novelist Christopher Hope, was persecuted in South Africa for his anti-government views, so the family fled to England when Daniel was six months old. His mother, Eleanor, got a job as secretary to Yehudi Menuhin. Daniel became a playmate of Menuhin's grandchildren, and although the old master was not a significant figure in the boy's life, he did inspire Daniel to take up the violin under the supervision of neighbor Sheila Nelson, one of England's top violin teachers to children. Hope went on to study with several Russian instructors at the Royal College of Music, then traveled to Hamburg to study from 1992 to 1998 with another Russian, Zakhar Bron. He also took degrees from the Royal Academy of Music in London.</p><p>As a student in Hamburg, Hope developed a friendship with composer Alfred Schnittke (in 2003 he was entrusted with the premiere of the composer's recently discovered violin sonata from 1955), and would soon devote himself largely though never exclusively to the music of Schnittke and other living composers. He has commissioned works from the likes of Jan Müller-Wieland, Huw Watkins, and Roxanna Panufnik.</p><p>Hope's career began to take off in his mid-20s, and in 2002 he was recruited on one week's notice to perform on tour with the Beaux Arts Trio. Almost immediately he was accepted as a permanent member of the ensemble and worked to spice up the group's fairly conservative repertoire with commissioned works by such composers as György Kurtág and Mark-Anthony Turnage to celebrate the trio's 50th anniversary. He has continued an active chamber music career, in concert and on recordings, after the Beaux Arts Trio dissolved in 2008.</p><p>In 2004 Hope won three major awards for his recording of the Berg (in its original version) and Britten concertos; readers of the English monthly Gramophone voted it the best available recording of the Berg. He serves as associate artistic director of the eclectic Savannah (Georgia) Music Festival, and since 2010 as Artistic Partner at Festspiele Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Hope has also written four books about his life and about music, and often contributes music articles to The Wall Street Journal. He has also hosted radio and television programs about music, including the 2013 documentary film The Secrets of the Violin.</p><p>Hope's recordings in the 2010s continued to run the stylistic and generic gamut. He offered the crossover minimalism of Ludovico Einaudi's I Giorni in 2012; paid a traditional tribute to his stylistic exemplar Yehudi Menuhin; and recorded a pair of novel albums: 2012's Vivaldi Recomposed (in which his creative partner was German-British composer Max Richter) and 2017's For Seasons, which offered a straightforward set of Vivaldi's Four Seasons concertos joined with a dozen works of seasonal significance from various eras. This stylistic diversity has brought Hope a good deal of mainstream attention: in 2016 he served as a television presenter for Eurovision Young Musicians, the classical-music arm of the famed Eurovision Song Contest.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>James Reel</strong></p>",

To judge from his impeccably stylish performances, Hope has the music-making of period colleagues ringing in his ears; but although there's more than a touch of the Hespèrions, for instance, about his bubbling, percussion-enhanced accounts of Falconieri and Ortiz, it would be wrong to suggest that he's ~playing at Baroque~ rather than creating something that's individual and true to himself.</p><p>For a start, his choice of music is clearly the product of much consideration, for alongside favourites such as the Pachelbel Canon and Bach's ~Air on a G String~ (exquisitely performed with a one-to-a-part ensemble drawn from members of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe), Hope homes in on single, characterful movements from relatively obscure larger works, including sonatas by the dazzling German Johann Paul von Westhoff, whom even period players have tended to neglect.</p><p>The concertos by Telemann and Geminiani are thoughtfully chosen, and there is also a handful of specially made arrangements. So what impression will be gained by new listeners following Hope and his excellent collaborators in this repertoire? He himself says he wants to emphasise the modern-ness of the music, and the exotic attraction some of these wandering composer-violinists must have had in person. In this he succeeds entirely, for this is an exciting disc with a heady, pied-piper power over the listener that comes from realising that the bright sense of discovery once felt by these composers is being experienced just as much by their modern-day interpreters. You can't ask for much more than that.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Kemp</strong></p>"

However, a string of blatantly commercial albums later in the decade damaged his reputation and, just when Hubbard, in the early '90s (with the deaths of Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis), seemed perfectly suited for the role of veteran master, his chops started causing him serious troubles.</p><p>Born and raised in Indianapolis, Hubbard played early on with Wes and Monk Montgomery. He moved to New York in 1958, roomed with Eric Dolphy (with whom he recorded in 1960), and was in the groups of Philly Joe Jones (1958-1959), Sonny Rollins, Slide Hampton, and J.J. Johnson, before touring Europe with Quincy Jones (1960-1961). He recorded with John Coltrane, participated in Ornette Coleman's <i>Free Jazz</i> (1960), was on Oliver Nelson's classic <i>Blues and the Abstract Truth</i> album (highlighted by ~Stolen Moments~), and started recording as a leader for Blue Note that same year. Hubbard gained fame playing with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers (1961-1964) next to Wayne Shorter and Curtis Fuller. He recorded <i>Ascension</i> with Coltrane (1965), <i>Out to Lunch</i> (1964) with Eric Dolphy, and <i>Maiden Voyage</i> with Herbie Hancock, and, after a period with Max Roach (1965-1966), he led his own quintet, which at the time usually featured altoist James Spaulding. A blazing trumpeter with a beautiful tone on flügelhorn, Hubbard fared well in freer settings but was always essentially a hard bop stylist.</p><p>In 1970, Freddie Hubbard recorded two of his finest albums (<i>Red Clay</i> and <i>Straight Life</i>) for CTI. The follow-up, <i>First Light</i> (1971), was actually his most popular date, featuring Don Sebesky arrangements. But after the glory of the CTI years (during which producer Creed Taylor did an expert job of balancing the artistic with the accessible), Hubbard made the mistake of signing with Columbia and recording one dud after another; <i>Windjammer</i> (1976) and <i>Splash</i> (a slightly later effort for Fantasy) are low points. However, in 1977, he toured with Herbie Hancock's acoustic V.S.O.P. Quintet and, in the 1980s, on recordings for Pablo, Blue Note, and Atlantic, he showed that he could reach his former heights (even if much of the jazz world had given up on him). But by the late '80s, Hubbard's ~personal problems~ and increasing unreliability (not showing up for gigs) started to really hurt him, and a few years later his once-mighty technique started to seriously falter. Freddie Hubbard's fans can still certainly enjoy his many recordings for Blue Note, Impulse, Atlantic, CTI, Pablo, and his first Music Masters sets.</p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b>",

		"biography": "<p>The history of MississippiJohn Hurt reads like a real Cinderella story. Born JohnSmith Hurt on July 3, 1893, in Teoc (Carroll Co.), MS,his family moved to Avalon, MS (where he grew up) whenhe was two years of age. One of ten children (who allplayed music of one sort or another), Hurt was the mostinto it and taught himself how to play. Years later,when his White landlord asked how he came up with hismelodies, he replied, &quot;Well sir, I just make itsound like I think it should.&quot; </p><p>Although he learned to read and write, he did notattend school past the fourth grade. As a young adult,he became a sharecropper or tenant farmer for many years,but finally gave that up and switched to day labor.For fun and extra cash, Hurt joined other local guitaristsand fiddlers for church suppers and town dances in surroundingtowns. Hurt soon became a popular favorite at theselocal functions. </p><p>In the late '20s, a well-known fiddler named WillieNarmour, with whom Hurt often played, was spottedby a talent scout for Okeh Phonograph, a division ofColumbia Records. When asked about other talented localmusicians, Narmour gave them the name of John Hurt and directions on howto find him. Okeh found and interviewed Hurt, had himplay a few songs, and decided to record him, providedhe was willing to travel to Memphis and New York. </p><p>Hurt recorded two songs in February of 1928 whilein Memphis, &quot;Frankie&quot; and &quot;Nobody's DirtyBusiness,&quot; and these were released by Okeh. ThatDecember, Hurt traveled to New York City to record fivemore sides. During that visit he met LonnieJohnson, but made a point of declaring that he cribbednothing from that great guitarist. Hurt's records didnot sell in great numbers, perhaps in the hundreds.After his short musical excursion, John returned toAvalon and went back to sharecropping and playing musicjust about every Saturday night in the towns surroundinghis home. </p><p>That could have been the end of Hurt's national careerhad two young blues musicians from Washington, D.C., Tom Hoskins and Mike Stewart, not come across the original Okeh recordingof &quot;Avalon Blues.&quot; This was in 1963. Intriguedby John's intricate finger-picking style, they cameup with the idea of trying to locate some of the originalartists, should they still be alive. They checked theMississippi maps, but no town named Avalon could befound. However, after locating an 1878 atlas, sure enough,there was an Avalon marked on a rural road running betweenGreenwood and Grenada. On a hope and a whim, the twoblues archivists headed south armed with a tape recorder.With the help of the old map, they found Avalon withits single gas station/store and inquired about JohnHurt. </p><p>They were floored to see the attendant point downthe road and say that Hurt's house was &quot;About amile down that road, third mail box up the hill. Can'tmiss it.&quot; Hurt, at 71 years of age, was waitingfor them, alive and still able to sing and play aboutas well as he had before. They recorded John and returnedto Washington with the precious taped results and therediscovery of Mississippi John Hurt. He was a completeand instant success in the folk/blues scene. </p><p>From the Spring of 1963, when he was brought to Washington,D.C., to perform, until his death in 1966, Hurt playedall over the Northeast at clubs and many folk festivals,including twice at the Newport Folk Festival. Much admiredby his new-found audience, Hurt loved his late successand gave as much as he got. He was befriended by fellowperformers like <b>Doc Watson</b>, <b>Fred McDowell</b>, and <b>Elizabeth Cotten</b>. In the end, he retired to a small home inGranada, MS, not far from his home town of Avalon. Somuch for a great story; the music is just as good. </p><p>Mississippi John Hurt is an exquisite country-bluessinger/guitarist with a",

		"biography": "<p>Described by the Boston Globe's Michael Manning as a musician who plays ~beyond virtuosity,~ guitarist Sharon Isbin has been a consistent challenge for critics, who struggle to find the right superlative that would do justice to her exquisite playing. ~In her hands,~ wrote Anne Midgette in The New York Times, ~the guitar takes on the precision of a diamond, each note a clear, shining facet that catches, prism-like, a glimpse of the spectrum.~ In essence, a performance by Isbin is like a painting by Vermeer: a formally impeccable and inexhaustible work of art. A Renaissance woman of the guitar, Isbin performs worldwide at famous venues and commissions new work from distinguished American composers (more than any other guitarist) for her instruments, collaborates with a wide variety of musicians, and indefatigably searches for new music to play. As a child, Isbin wanted to be a scientist like her father. However, she started guitar lessons at the age of nine (the family was living in Italy at the time) and found her vocation. Her teachers included Andrés Segovia and harpsichordist Rosalyn Tureck. With Tureck, Isbin worked on the first performance edition, for guitar, of J.S. Bach's Lute Suites. This project eventually resulted in a critically acclaimed disc. In 1989, Isbin founded the guitar department at the Juilliard School of Music and became that institution's first professor of guitar. Isbin's recordings have consistently been assessed as groundbreaking musical events. In 1995, her disc was the first ever American guitar concert presented to a Russian cosmonaut during a rendezvous between the space shuttle Atlantis and the Russian spaceship Mir. Journey to the Amazon, performed with Brazilian percussionist Thiago de Mello and saxophonist Paul Winter, earned Isbin a Grammy nomination in 1999. She received a Grammy in 2001 for her Dreams of a World: Folk-Inspired Music for Guitar. Significantly, this was the first classical guitar Grammy in 28 years. In 2002, Isbin got another Grammy for her extraordinary performance of concerti by Christopher Rouse and Tan Dun. The concerti featured on this world-premiere disc were dedicated to Isbin. Spanning various styles, genres, and periods, Isbin's other recordings include Aaron Jay Kernis' Double Concerto (with violinist Cho-Liang Lin), Rodrigo: Concierto de Aranjues, and Sharon Isbin Plays Baroque Favorites for Guitar. The last-named album features a truly astounding performance of a transcription of Bach's Violin Concerto in A minor.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Zoran Minderovic</strong></p>",

		"biography": "<p>The central figure in Spectrum was singer/songwriter/guitarist Mike Rudd, one of the many outstanding expatriate NZ performers who have contributed so much to the Australian music scene. Mike arrived in Australia in 1966 as rhythm guitarist for the NZ group Chants R&B. (For the full History of this great band, please visit the Chants R&B page on Bruce Sergent's excellent New Zealand Music of the 60's and 70's website.)</p><p>Chants only lasted a short time after they arrived in Australia, but Mike remained in Melbourne, where he soon teamed up with young singer-songwriter Ross Wilson and guitarist Ross Hannaford. Their first band The Pink Finks (which had also just broken up) worked in a similar vein to Chants, and had some local chart success in Melbourne. Mike was invited to be the bass player in a later lineup of their next band, the short-lived but legendary Party Machine (1967-69). This was followed by the more experimentally-oriented Sons of The Vegetal Mother (1969-71).</p><p>Sons of the Vegetal Mother was an occasional project rather than a full-time band, but Mike was apparently involved on a regular basis, even after the formation of Spectrum, and he played bass on the Vegetal's only recording, an ultra-rare EP called The Garden Party, of which only about 250 copies were ever pressed. Although close connections between them continued, by 1970 Wilson and Hannaford were concentrating on the Vegetals new offshoot Daddy Cool, so Rudd decided to put together his own band, continuing down the progressive path he had been following with Party Machine and the Vegetals.</p><p>Mike Rudd: ~I had a burning desire to put a band around some original material. That was the only thing I was thinking of. I hadn't even thought of whether I was capable of doing it or not. I was mainly impressed with how well the Party Machine had worked on that level and I thought, well, I'll try it.~</p><p>~We were a professional amateur band, with the courage of our convictions. We were aggressively original when it just wasn’t fashionable to be like that. We were totally immersed in what we were doing.~</p><p>Although Mike later described the formation of the band as ~incredibly haphazard~, his choices were all fortunate ones. Bassist Bill Putt, from Melbourne bands Gallery and The Lost Souls formed a lasting friendship and musical partnegsubip with Mike, and they have worked together ever since. Organist Lee Neale happily left his current band, Nineteen 87, who were apparently scornful of his lack of 'pop image'. A hotshot young drummer called Mark Kennedy, who had already worked with Putt in Gallery, completed the lineup. Kennedy's musical strength helped carry the band through a difficult first year, during which time the band honed their skills and found their sound.</p><p>~Mark really carried us through the first year because people would say 'Wow, look at that drummer, they must be a good group.'~</p><p>~Mark was the central focus of the band 'cause he was such an outstanding player. He used to play things like drum solos!, but he was very good. By the same token, I was almost relieved to get away from that 'cause the emphasis swung back to the material and the band in general rather than one player.~</p><p>Initially, Spectrum drew on the work of contemporary bands like Traffic, Soft Machine and Pink Floyd and they played covers of these groups in the early days, but they soon outgrew these formative influences, developing their own highly individual style. Many elements contributed to this –- their synergistic playing style, the rock-solid yet supple rhythm Putt-Kennedy rhythm section, Lee Neale’s superb keyboard playing, Mike's skewed, rather Goonish sense of humour, which was manifested in his wry song titles and lyrics, his expressive finger-picked guitar, and of course his voice, one of the most distinctive in Australian music.</p><p>Twelve months of gigging allowed them to polish their performance and write and refine a substantial set of original material, which became the basis for their first LP. They were regulars at the concerts events held at the various ~head~ venues around Melbourne like the TF Much Ballroom, Garrison and Sebastian’s, and they appeared with other leading progressive bands like Tully, Tamam Shud and Sons Of The Vegetal Mother. </p><p>Financially though, the rewards were slim. Inspired by his time in the Vegetals, Rudd had conceived Spectrum as a concert band, and they generally performed with a large and costly set-up, which included a large PA and a full multi-media light show. At one stage the band even supplemented their act with members of the Melbourne performance troupe Tribe. They played at all the major Australian rock festivals of the period, including Wallacia, Myponga, Mulwala, Rosebud and Sunbury. However, their national success was limited by the lack of ongoing radio support in other capitals, and the fact that they rarely ventured outside Victoria, visiting other cities only intermittently (probably because of the costs, and the lack of suitable venues in other cities).</p><p>Unfortunately for Spectrum, a major logistical problem was emerging -- the focus of the Melbourne music scene undergoing a profound shift. This was partly due to changes to the age of majority (recently lowered in many states from 21 to 18) and to the licensing laws governing entertainment in hotels in Victoria. These legislative changes coincided with demographic changes -- the young audiences who had patronized the unlicensed dances and discos in the mid-to-late Sixties were now ageing into their late teens and early twenties, and were therefore now able to enter licensed premises. Seeing the popularity of rock music and realising the financial potential, hoteliers went all-out to woo customers into the pubs by putting on popular bands, often free of charge. Consequently, even as Spectrum worked to establish themselves, the focus was beginning to shift away from the larger concert events and unlicensed city discotheques frequented by 'head' audiences, whose main drug of choice was cannabis, and towards the burgeoning pub circuit, where alcohol was cheap, plentiful and, above all, legal. While the smaller pub venues and their rowdy, combative atmosphere suited more 'aggressive' bands like The Aztecs to a tee, the erosion of the concert scene posed a major problem for Spectrum, whose complex music and upscale presentation demanded both a larger audience, and a reasonable degree of concentration from them. Consequently, as the pub circuit began to boom, the bigger engagements that Spectrum needed to survive became fewer and less regular.</p><p>Despite a loyal following and much praise from the music press (notably Go-Set) the band were virtually broke by mid-1970, when a measure of salvation came in the form of a contract with to the new EMI progressive imprint Harvest. Interviewed by Ian McFarlane in 1990, Mike reflected on this situation and its influence on the formation of Spectrum’s alter-ego, Indelible Murtceps:</p><p>~We had painted ourselves into a corner. We touted Spectrum as a concert band, but the concerts were few and far between. The pub scene was beginning to burgeon and we were looking bankruptcy in the face, so we decided to do something about it. I felt we should divide the material and take the load off ourselves. It was considerably different for us. We used half the gear for a start.~</p><p>Before being signed up by EMI, Spectrum had cut a demo single, which they hawked around to record companies as a 7~ acetate. One side was an early, folky version of one of the newer songs in their set, I'll Be Gone; the flip was another original, ~You Just Can't Win~. According to Ian McFarlane, these acetates are now ~impossibly rare~ with only two or three copies known to have survived. ~You Just Can't Win~ was reissued to subscribers to From The Vault magazine on a 7” flexidisc in 1990, accompanied by the almost equally rare Vegetals track ~Let It Begin~, from their fabled Garden Party EP. The Spectrum track is now available of Aztec Music's CD reissue of Spectrum's first album.</p><p>Once signed to EMI, the band went into the studio to make their first official recordings, under EMI house producer Howard Gable, who had made a name as one Australia's leading new producers for his work with bands like the The Masters Apprentices. They laid down two tracks -- ~Launching Place~, ~Launching Place Part II~, and at the end of the session, Gable asked if they had anything else:</p><p>~...we'd actually gone into the studio in order to record 'Launching Place Parts I & II', to help promote the Launching Place Festival. When we had finished recording those, Howard asked us did we have any others and I said, ~Yeah, I've got this one called 'I'll Be Gone', which we recorded as an afterthought. But then it became a hit single.~</p><p>These first recordngs were soon followed by the tracks for their first LP, but shortly after the album sessions Mark Kennedy left the band, in August 1970. Had Kennedy left a few months earlier, it could have posed areal problem for Spectrum, but by that time they felt more than able to carry on:</p><p>~...by the time Mark evolved away from the band, the rest of us were aware of our potential and ready to go.~</p><p>Mark's place was taken by seasoned ex-Brisbane drummer Ray Arnott, (Chelsea Set, The Browns, Cam-Pact, Co. Caine) who proved an ideal replacement -- as well as being an excellent drummer, Arnott was a good singer and composed his own material. After Spectrum, Kennedy played on many sessions and worked with Leo De Castro in King Harvest, Friends, Renee Geyer, Marcia Hines (to whom he was engaged for some time) and McGuire, Kennedy & Burton band, which was the nucleus of the highly-touted jazz-rock outfit Ayers Rock in 1973.</p><p>One of Ray Arnott's first major gigs with Spectrum, a typical engagement of the time, was 31 October 1970 when Spectrum played a Jimi Hendrix/Janis Joplin Memorial at the TF Much Ballroom, with Sons Of The Vegetal Mother, Lipp Arthur, Adderly Smith Blues Band – a show historically notable as one of the first official appearances by the Vegetals’ new offshoot, Daddy Cool.</p><p>As the 1971 opened, all the hard slog paid off handsomely when ~I'll Be Gone~ (b/w ~Launching Place Part II~) was released as Spectrum’s debut single in January 1971. Heralded by Mike’s unforgettable harmonica intro, ~I’ll Be Gone~ announced the arrival of both Spectrum as a major new band and Mike Rudd as a significant new songwriter. It is without question one of the greatest Australian pop-rock songs ever written. Mike’s lyric is timeless, simple but eloquent -- a wistful, almost fatalistic observation of life on the road and the elusiveness of love and fortune. With its loping country-blues feel, the easy, swinging backbeat from Mark and Bill, and interlocking guitar and electric piano by Mike and Lee, ~I'll Be Gone~ became an immediate hit, racing up the charts to became the national #1 in February 1971 and spending 20 weeks in the charts.</p><p>Its success was considerably assisted by one of Australia's classic early promotional films, created by musician and film maker Chris Lofven (who also made the clip for Daddy Cool's Eagle Rock soon after). The simple but evocative monochrome film clip, which cost the princely sum of $300, was filmed around Tullamarine and features brief glimpses of Mike's wife Helen and their young son, Chris, who also appears on the front cover of Spectrum Part One.</p><p>The single was actually an edited (3:28) mono version of the full-length (4:24) stereo master, and at the time the full version was only ever released on vinyl on a compilation album, Go-Set Pop Poll Awards 1971. The longer version is finally became available on CD on the Raven Records Spectrum compilation in the early 1990s and is now included on the Aztec resissue of Spectrum Part One. The song is justly regarded as a classic, and is generally credited as the flagship of the new era in Australian rock that began in 1970-71. (~I'll Be Gone~ and ~Launching Place~ were later covered on the LP The Good Earth by Manfred Mann's Earth Band, which at that time included of former Procession guitarist Mick Rodgers.)</p><p>The flipside, ~Launching Place Part II~ is a very curious piece. It’s much more in keeping with the rest of the Spectrum oeuvre -- the intense, powerdrive minor-key introduction is led by some fine organ work from Neale, and the song proper and contains some of Rudd’s strongest early writing. By Mike’s account ~Launching Place~ Parts I and II were written to promote the Launching Place Festival in late 1970, but the lyrics of Part II read as a rather savage attack on the naiveté of the prevailing peace-and-love festival ethos. Lines like ~Doctor, doctor, take your shoes off, dance around in sheep manure~, are typical of Mike’s black humour, he makes it sound like an altogether unappealing event and there’s even more disturbing imagery in the last verse:</p><blockquote>    ~The world no longer is a virgin, empty sockets blankly stare    and children making love to children, children making love to children”.</blockquote><p>We can only wonder what the Launching Place organizers made of all this!</p><p>As noted above, Spectrum had recorded the tracks for their debut album prior to Mark Kennedy's departure. Spectrum Part One, produced by Howard Gable, engineered by the illustrious team of Ern Rose and Roger Savage, was released in April 1971. With a noble disdain for commercial considerations, the group refused to let EMI include ~I'll Be Gone~ on the LP, a decision that had Mike scratching his head in later years:</p><p>~It's still a matter of some disbelief for myself that we didn't include I'll Be Gone on that album. I'm sure it couldn't happen these days. EMI probably made that rule after we'd sent that album out. It probably would have sold a lot more copies. Still, 'I'll Be Gone' has had a marvellous life. When it became a big hit we refused to let EMI include it on the album, and they were silly enough to humour us. We were so underground we didn't know what was going on in the real world. Our heads were right under the ground.~</p><p>Still, the decision was understandable in the context of the time -- ~I’ll Be Gone~ was quite different from the rest of the music on the album, and it evidently didn’t reflect the direction they wanted to follow. Even without the hit single, the album did extremely well, reaching #10 in Melbourne and #13 nationally. As a debut album it's a tremendously assured piece of work, and it’s a great snapshot of how Spectrum sounded on stage at the time. Three decades on, Spectrum Part One has barely dated. Virtually recorded live, the performances are tight and strong, and the production -- sparse, understated and well balanced -- has really helped the album to last. There is no unnecessary studio trickery, and the mix favours a dry and very 'present' sound on most of the instruments, with spacious reverb on the vocals - a marked contrast to the echo-drenched, infinitely overdubbed extravaganzas that were becoming de-rigueur in prog-rock circles.</p><p>~Spectrum Part One was basically what we'd been playing live; it was the basic feel of the band. It was a live recording. There wasn't much overdubbing, pretty much that was it.~</p><p>With a nod to Ross Wilson, the album kicks off with a jarring and discordant introduction, leading into Spectrum’s stately, atmospheric reading of Ross's ~Make Your Stash~ -- a track dating from Ross's recent stint in London with Procession. Wilson recorded his own version not long after, on Daddy Cool's second LP Sex Drugs, Rock’n’Roll: Teenage Heaven, but the Daddy Cool version is a much more frenetic arrangement that shows the unmistakable influence of Frank Zappa. If the melody sounds familiar it’s because Ross Wilson lifted it straight out the 'Jupiter' section of Gustav Holst's famous orchestral suite The Planets. Another Party Machine connection comes with the closing track, ~Mumbles I Wonder Why~, which was co-written by Mike and Ross Hannaford. The highlights of the record are probably the two extended pieces, the classic ~Superbody~ –- which still stands one of Spectrum’s best tracks -- and ~Fiddling Fool~, which clock in at over 9 and 12 minutes respectively. The emphasis is on texture, atmosphere and dynamics, rather than on production tricks or attention-grabbing solos, and it's one of the reasons the record has worn so well -– and it has to be acknowledged that Lee Neale’s keyboard work on both these longer tracks is quite outstanding.</p><p>One of the most distinctive features of Spectrum was their unrivalled ensemble playing, and their attention to dynamics, light and shade, and the texture of the music. In Spectrum, Mike began playing a Fender Stratocaster. He was one of the few electric lead guitarists in Australia to use a fingerpicking style, rather than a plectrum, and he quickly grew to understand the unique character of the 'Strat' sound, and used it to full advantage. Mike explained to how his playing style evolved:</p><p>~After I finished with the Party Machine and tearfully forsook bass-playing, I looked at the prospect of resuming guitar. I decided that the possibility was that I might have to cover a little more than just rhythm (which was my specialty with the Chants) and I was daunted. ~Why not just be different and avoid invidious comparisons with far more accomplished guitarists?~ I thought. So I dropped the pick. My first guitar was an L-series Strat which I strung with medium gauge strings (akin to fencing wire in tension and feel) and this largely dictated the tone. Then, as now, I favoured the neck pick-up and still managed to sound pretty peaky. I used Strauss solid-state amps.”</p><p>Bill Putt is one of the heroes of the bass. His Fender bass sound is deep, rich, full and incredibly satisfying to the ear -- the perfect bass sound in my opinion. His playing is authoritative and always spot-on: no frills, always totally in sync with the drums, but never dull. Similarly, Lee Neale has to be given his due as one of the all-time great Australian rock organists. His keyboard work is thoughtful, subtle yet distinctive, the antithesis of the ‘look-at-me’ theatrics of a Rick Wakeman or Keith Emerson, and his sense of tone and feel, and the overall intelligence and sensitivity of his playing is outstanding. He’s a great accompanist as well as a great soloist, which is a rare commodity. Mark Kennedy shows plenty of the form that soon made him one of Australia’s most in-demand session drummers. Check out his superb polyrhythmic drumming in the central section of ~Superbody~, or his exquisite cymbal fills at the end of the intro to ~Drifting~, and you’ll hear exactly what we’re talking about.</p><p>Hot on the heels of Spectrum's single success, the two Rosses, Wilson and Hannaford, stormed up the Australian charts with Daddy Cool and their classic single ~Eagle Rock~. Daddy Cool and Spectrum embarked on a joint national tour in mid-1971, which included performances at the Aquarius Festival of University Arts in Canberra. The tour highlighted the differences between the styles of -- and audience reactions to -- the two bands. The experience of the joint tour might have given them added impetus for the formation of Spectrum's alter ego in October 1971. Interviewed during the tour, Mike offered this observation on the situation, and on supposed rivalry between the bands:</p><p>~While we've found success with a commercial record, people have found out we're not what we appear to be. They've started appreciating us for all that we're doing now. Daddy Cool gauge their audiences completely differently. Their audience jumps around and screams out, and if that doesn't happen it's a bad audience. But for us, if they're just sitting there we know it's good. It's a feeling, not an open response. We have to follow our audience but Daddy Cool's comes to them. I think they're the best rock'n'roll band in Australia. We don't resent their success at all, we just resent ignorant audiences.~</p><p>After the tour, Spectrum checked into Bill Armstrong's Studios in Melbourne and spent all of September recording the tracks for their next album, using Armstrong's newly installed 16-track recorder -- the first of its kind in Australia. With the new LP in the can, Spectrum set about addressing their economic woes and reorganising themselves as a performing unit. Realising that their lengthy and complex material was precluding them from getting bookings on the lucrative dance and pub circuit, they created a set of simpler, dancier music, using a pared-down stage setup. He re-christened the band as Indelible Murtceps for the purpose, thus allowing Spectrum to continue on its progressive course while enabling them to supplement their income with the Murtceps gigs.</p><p>Spectrum's second single, released in October, was a brooding Ray Arnott song called Trust Me, a song he had performed with Company Caine. It should be noted that, as with almost all the Spectrum (and Ariel) 45s, the single version of Trust Me is a different recording to the version which appeared on their next LP – it’s not an edited version of the album track, as is sometimes stated. Unfortunately it failed to chart, perhaps being too down-beat for audiences used to the 'happier' sound of ~I'll Be Gone~.</p><p>January 1972 was a high point in Spectrum's career, with two major events that month. The first was the release of their landmark second album – Milesago, the very first true Australian 'rock' double-album and only the second 'popular double album ever released in this country (the first was Doug Ashdown's Age of Mouse in 1970). Milesago is, quite simply, a masterpiece. The luxury of being able to spread the music across four sides allowed for much greater scope and diversity in the songs and arrangements, but they did not sacrifice the organic, improvisational feel of their live performances, and the result is by no means self-indulgent. Even at their most expansive, economy was always a watchword in Spectrum’s music -- unlike so many “prog” Albums of the era, there’s no “filler” material here, and nary a wasted note throughout. Milesago is chock-full of great moments, with several superb new extended tracks including the title track, the brilliantly ironic ~What The World Need’s Now (Is A New Pair Of Socks)~ -- a dig at the peace-and-love schtick of the Bacharach-David hit -- the sombre ~Fly Without Its Wings~, the epic four-part suite ~The Sideways Saga~, and a new, six-minute version of Ray Arnott’s ~Trust Me~. Once again, the production is fairly dry and warm, capturing the essential Spectrum sound but this time the 16-track facilities allow far greater fidelity and permitted the addition of extra layers to the arrangements, and it has to be said that Milesago is still a superb-sounding record. It’s also the only Spectrum album to feature outside players -- a brass section arranged and led by sax player Jeremy Noone (Vegetals, Co. Caine, Daddy Cool) with Simon Wettenhall on tuba and Steve Miller on trombone. The music press was full of praise, and it even received a highly favourable review from English music bible NME on its release in England. It reached #16 on the LP charts in January 1972. It was originally released in a textured cover, but later pressings were issued in a gloss-laminated flat cover. Its distinctive hallucinogenic collage was one of the first major album covers created by Go-Set staff artist Ian McCausland, who rapidly became the leading Australian cover and poster artist of the period.</p><p>The other major event for Spectrum in January 1972 was their appearance at the historic first Sunbury Festival over the Australia Day Weekend. They played as both Spectrum and Murtceps, and their performances were recorded for EMI’s Sunbury live double LP. As Spectrum, they took up the whole of side two of the album with their extended renditions of ~Some Good Advice~ and ~I'll Be Gone~, and the Murtceps cuts included were ~We Are Indelible~, ~Be My Honey~ and ~But That's Alright~.</p><p>Milesago’s opening track ~But That's Alright~ (b/w ~Play A Song That I Know~) was the third Spectrum single, released in February '72, but in spite of its considerable commercial appeal, it failed to chart. Once again, the single was a different and shorter version of the track that appeared on the album. To promote it Spectrum made a rare TV appearance on Happening ’72; regrettably they had to mime to the single, but fortunately this rare glimpse of the band on video has survived and still exists in the archives of Channel 0 in Melbourne.</p><p>As both Spectrum and Indelible Murtceps the group gigged consistently throughout 1972; they were commonly billed under both names, and usually played alternating sets of the relevant material. Despite the poor commercial showing of the previous Spectrum Singles, Murtceps surprisingly scored a top-40 hit in Melbourne with their jaunty single Esmaralda in May 1972 -- again, a different version from that on the Murtceps LP.</p><p>A few months later they recorded a full LP under the Murtceps banner, called Warts Up Your Nose. It’s also notable as featuring engineering credits by all of Armstrong’s “Big Four” recording engineers of the period – Ern Rose, Roger Savage, John French and John Sayers. The album featured a brown cardboard cover (delightfully suggestive of the old ~plain brown wrapper~ pornography jokes) and it sported a quaint cover cartoon by Mike. Evidently, Murtceps was providing some much-needed light relief for the band, and thematically, most of the album was replete with sexual and toilet humour, with tracks like In The Bog, Blue Movies Made Me Cry, Hand Jive, Snap Crackle And... There was also a re-recorded version of the single tracks We Are Indelible -- Mike's ironic commentary on the band's commercial fortunes -- and Esmaralda, a tribute to an overworked “working girl”, in a similar vein to the Small Faces’ Rene).</p><p>Mike: ~We had a lot of fun with the Warts Up Your Nose album. It lent itself to some quaintly bizarre notions, I suppose. It's an amusing album.~</p><p>With his typically bent sense of humour, Mike's writer credits on the album were given as ~My Crudd~. Notwithstanding the comical aspects, the album is a solid achievement and one of that’s much loved by those who know it. It also contained a real gem as its centerpiece -- the epic, 13-minute dope-smokers' anthem, Some Good Advice, one of Mike's most enduring and enjoyable songs. It's a perfect example of the Spectrum/Murtceps sound, and the interlock between Mike's guitar and Lee's electric piano on the main riff, rippling over the relentless chugging of Bill and Ray’s rhythm section, is pure magic.</p><p>Around this time, Spectrum also contributed material for an obscure detective film called Dalmas by Bert Dehling, who later directed the feature Pure Shit. Snap Crackle And... from Warts was apparently the only track actually used in the film, but they also recorded at least one other instrumental piece Dalmas (Theme) which eventually surfaced on EMI's ROYGBIV compilation in 1984 (although this track does not appear on the Ghosts CD).</p><p>Mike: ~We never even saw the finished film. It had what you might call a 'limited pubic release'. We basically jammed to the images we saw at a preview screening and that was about it. I'm sure we didn't even get paid for it.~</p><p>Sadly, Warts Up Your Nose was to be Lee Neale’s swansong -- he suffered some form of breakdown shortly after the album was completed and left the band in September 1972. Regrettably, this fine player abandoned the music scene for good, dropping completely out of sight, and to this day not even Mike and Bill know anything about Lee’s whereabouts, or what became of him after leaving Spectrum.</p><p>Neale was replaced by Canberra keyboard player John Mills, and Spectrum continued playing regularly. They recorded their third studio album, Testimonial early in 1973. This marked a change in sound, and a shift to a new producer, New Zealand born Peter Dawkins, who later went on to considerable acclaim as the producer of Dragon, among his many other achievements. Testimonial was eventually released in July 1973 and reached #12 in August that year, and a single Indelible Shuffle/Ray’s Boogie was also released but apparently did not chart. Ironically, by the time Testimonial finally hit the stores, Mike’s new band Ariel was already hitting the charts with their debut single.</p><p>After the brilliance of the previous two Albums, and the loss of Lee Neale, its not surprising that Testimonial comes off as a somewhat less impressive effort, and even Mike admitted that the band had begun to run out of steam by the time it was recorded:</p><p>~Testimonial was a pretty low-key album. To me a lot of the inventiveness of the band is missing. Homesick Valium Blues nearly goes comatose at the end. There's not much humour in that album. I seem to think there were signs that the guts were falling out.~</p><p>How long Spectrum might have continued is anybody’s guess, but unfortunately the death-knell for this wonderful band sounded in March 1973 when Ray Arnott announced he was leaving to join Wilson and Hannaford's new band Mighty Kong. Feeling that they couldn’t maintain the spirit of the original group, Mike decided to break up the band and start afresh. Spectrum played their farewell concert on the 15 April 1973 at the Dallas Brooks Hall in Melbourne. The set list spanned the whole of their career and included the previously unrecorded Essay In Paranoia, a six-part suite that had been a longtime staple of their live shows. Happily, the concert was recorded and it was released in December 1973 as the superb double-LP, Terminal Buzz, engineered and mixed by Roger Savage and John Sayers. The album's iconic cover, a visual pun on the title, shows an hugely enlarged half-tone image of a fly impaled on a pin. (Flies seem to have been something of a lyrical preoccupation for Mike).</p><p>~Terminal Buzz still sounds good. It has terrific atmosphere. We were a live band after all, and the songs on that album stand up pretty well.~</p><p>In a fitting valedictory, ~I'll Be Gone~ was chosen as the final rock single to be played on 3AK -- once Melbourne's top-rating pop station -- before it switched to a so-called ~Beautiful Music~ format on 1 June 1973.</p>",

				"review": "<p>This record is a typically unassuming artefact from the early 1970s Aussie rock scene that seems to want to hide its light under a bushel. It doesn’t jump up and scream out “Look at me! Play me!”. On the surface, it seems to go about its business like a kindly old uncle sitting down to a nice cuppa tea but when you finally lift the lid on its contents you find that there’s a sly and demented sense of humour going on. It’s actually more like a naughty school boy enjoying a giggle at everyone else’s expense than any kind of avuncular persona you first thought.</p><p>Of course the giveaway is when you take a closer look at the front cover line drawing – a seedy flasher in flat cap, half-sized overcoat and rancid sneakers with a big nose, wide arse and hairy legs – which suggests sheer entertainment and more to be had inside. And then what of the song titles on the back cover – ‘Be My Honey’, ‘Pie in the Sky’, ‘Blue Movies Made Me Cry’, ‘We are Indelible’, ‘In the Bog’, ‘Esmeralda’, ‘Some Good Advice’ – surely enough enticement to give it a decent listen. Frank Zappa asked the question “does humour belong in music?” and clearly guitarist / singer / song writer Mike Rudd and The Indelible Murtceps agreed.</p><p>Since 1969 Rudd had been steering his band Spectrum with a steely resolve, to a great deal of success on the local scene. The group had gone to #1 in early 1971 with the enduring ‘I’ll Be Gone’ single but Rudd was still intent on presenting Spectrum as a “concert” attraction. In general the music was full-blown progressive rock with psychedelic and space-rock touches; audiences could sit cross-legged on the floor, soak up the vibes and let the expansive musical textures waft over them like great clouds of intoxicating marijuana smoke.</p><p>Not long after Spectrum’s chart success, Ross Wilson’s new band Daddy Cool went to #1 with ‘Eagle Rock’. The two bands embarked on the joint national Aquarius tour, and Rudd noticed how Daddy Cool encouraged their audiences to dance around and join in the fun. Rudd decided to forego Spectrum’s complex material for a much simpler, more danceable sound in order to work the lucrative discotheque / dance circuit.</p><p>In October 1971, he created a new band called The Indelible Murtceps utilising the same musicians (bassist Bill Putt, drummer Ray Arnott and organist Lee Neale) but with a different outlook. This allowed Spectrum to continue as a creative unit while the alter-ego Murtceps simply played for fun and profit. In addition to the more energetic, danceable sound, the basic difference musically was Neale playing the electric piano instead of Hammond organ. Mike Rudd was also billing himself now as My Crudd. The band enjoyed a minor hit single with the jaunty ‘Esmeralda’ b/w ‘We Are Indelible’ (#36 in May 1972) and issued the entertaining Warts Up Your Nose album (#19 in December 1972).</p><p>Prior to that, as well as featuring some astonishingly imaginative material Spectrum’s legendary double album Milesago (December 1971) also incorporated elements of Rudd’s new approach to dance moves with the likes of ‘Play a Song That I Know’, ‘But That’s Alright’ and ‘Virgin’s Tale’ being suited to the Indelible Murtceps gambit. It was as if one entity had already started to assimilate the other.</p><p>When the band appeared at the inaugural Sunbury Pop Festival, held over the Australia Day weekend at the end of January 1972, they were able to appear as both Spectrum and The Indelible Murtceps, yet each set incorporated elements of the other. The subsequent Various Artists double live album Sunbury issued by EMI later in the year featured Spectrum doing ‘Some Good Advice’ and ‘I’ll Be Gone’, while the Murtceps did ‘We Are Indelible’, ‘Be My Honey’ and ‘But That’s Alright’.</p><p>One of the great things about Warts Up Your Nose is that eight of the eleven tracks run for less than three minutes; only ‘Esmeralda’ and ‘Excuse Me Just One Moment’ go slightly over that mark while even the 12 minute 45 second ‘Some Good Advice’, which retains the Spectrum musical stamp, is deceptively simple in execution and outcome. The addition of a four-piece horn section on ‘Excuse Me Just One Moment’ and ‘Stay Another Day’ lends a jazzy swing to proceedings. All up, some of the quaintly bizarre notions expressed in ‘Pie in the Sky’, ‘Blue Movies Made Me Cry’, ‘Hand Jive’, ‘Stay Another Day’, ‘Some Good Advice’ and ‘Esmeralda’ retain a refreshing outlook to this day.</p><p>While Warts Up Your Nose is kinda rootsy in its own way, it’s clearly not one of those “heavy monster psych” records that collectors of arcane 1970s pieces go nuts over. The sad things is that it has yet to be reissued on CD; Aztec had started the Spectrum CD reissues project some years ago, releasing Spectrum Part One and Milesago but various unforeseen circumstances conspired to prevent things from moving ahead. The Spectrum / Murtceps albums Testimonial and Terminal Buzz are likewise waiting in the wings for a second chance on CD.</p><p>I still believe that these are the kinds of records that people need to hear again in the advancing digital age. Mike Rudd is still (occasionally) hitting the stage with Spectrum, despite the death last year of his musical partner of 44 years Bill Putt, so it would suggest that fans still appreciate this guy’s musical integrity. Let’s hope Warts Up Your Nose appears on CD sometime in the near future.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Ian McFarlane</strong</p>"

Coupling an oddball guitar tuning set against eerie, falsetto vocals, James's early recordings could make the hair stand up on the back of your neck. Even more surprising was when blues scholars rediscovered him in the '60s and found his singing and playing skills intact. Influencing everyone from a young Robert Johnson (Skip's ~Devil Got My Woman~ became the basis of Johnson's ~Hellhound on My Trail~) to Eric Clapton (who recorded James's ~I'm So Glad~ on the first Cream album), Skip James's music, while from a commonly shared regional tradition, remains infused with his own unique personal spirit.</p>&mdash; <b>Cub Koda</b>",

		"name": "Bert Jansch",
		"biography": "<p>One of the most important figures in contemporary British folk, Bert Jansch brought an unsurpassed combination of virtuosity and eclecticism to the acoustic guitar, both as a solo act and as a key member of Pentangle. Also a talented songwriter and affecting (if gruff) vocalist, he wrote dark and sparse material that recalled the folky side of Donovan, though he was much less pop-oriented than the psychedelic pop troubadour. Incorporating elements of blues, American folk, and British Isles traditional music into his playing, his influence was not only immense in the British folk scene, it also extended to the rock world -- Neil Young and Jimmy Page, two electric guitar gonzos who often turn to acoustic picking as well, have acknowledged Jansch as a major influence. Young went as far as to tell Guitar Player magazine that Jansch did for the acoustic guitar what Jimi Hendrix did for the electric. A revered elder statesperson in the U.K., he escaped widespread notice in the States, yet he had all the prerequisites for a large cult following on the order of Nick Drake, another musician whose work contains definite echoes of Jansch.</p><p>Born in Scotland, Jansch vagabonded around the U.K. and Europe for a while before basing himself in London in the early '60s. He made an impact on the city's folk community not only with his guitar skills, but with his original songwriting, singing his own compositions at a time when Dylan was just beginning to make that practice widespread in folk circles. Friend and fellow folksinger Anne Briggs helped Jansch get a contract with Transatlantic, a small British folky label. Recorded on a single microphone and a borrowed guitar at Jansch's apartment, his first album immediately established him as a major force in British folk. Consisting almost entirely of original compositions, the brooding, plaintive songs showcased his dexterous fingerpicking. ~Needle of Death,~ inspired by the heroin-related death of a friend, may still be his most famous composition.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/bj-it-dont-bother-me.jpg~ alt=~It Don't Bother Me~><p>Jansch graduated to a real studio for his second album, It Don't Bother Me. That LP featured some contributions from guitarist John Renbourn, and the pair would record a joint effort in the mid-'60s as well, Bert and John. Soon Jansch and Renbourn would be playing together as part of a five-member group, Pentangle, one of the greatest folk acts of the '60s. Pentangle, also featuring vocalist Jacqui McShee and the rhythm section of Danny Thompson and Terry Cox, was very much a group effort. Of all the group members, however, Jansch was probably the most important, writing the best original material, singing occasional lead vocals, and recording some enthralling guitar tandems with Renbourn.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/bj-nicola.jpg~ alt=~Nicola~><p>Jansch's increasing involvement (and eventual commercial success) with Pentangle did not mean an end to his solo career, although Pentangle got first priority in the late '60s and early '70s. Nicola, from 1967, was a pretty good attempt to commercialize his sound somewhat with poppier material and some fuller studio arrangements. Released in 1969, Birthday Blues was an effort more consistent with his early folk recordings, and included instrumental support by some members of Pentangle. Rosemary Lane (1971) is acclaimed by Jansch fans as one of his finest works.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/bj-black-swan.jpg~ alt=~The Black Swan~><p>Jansch's first decade of recording attracts the lion's share of interest from listeners, but he continued to record with his instrumental skills intact. For instance, Jansch played in re-formed versions of Pentangle in the '80s and '90s, while Drag City released the widely acclaimed Black Swan in 2006. However, in later years, ill health made it necessary for him to cancel previously scheduled concert and tour appearances. Jansch died of lung cancer at a hospice in Hampstead, London, England on October 5, 2011. He was 67 years old.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/bj-simple.jpg~ alt=~Just a Simple Soul~><p>The following years saw a number of posthumous releases, including a number of live albums. In 2018, Just a Simple Soul appeared, which was a career-spanning compilation of the late singer's work from his '60s solo recordings through to his final studio album. The collection was compiled by Jansch's estate and former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, who also wrote the liner notes for the release.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>",

That he has never risen above cult status is one of life's little mysteries. This collection spans the early stages of his career, and includes a couple of his best original compositions, ~It Don't Bother Me~ and the harrowing heroin ballad ~Needle of Death,~ as well as some well-chosen covers, including his take on Jackson C. Frank's ~Blues Run the Game~ and a near-definitive version of Davy Graham's classic instrumental ~Angie.~ Jansch's commercial high watermark came with Pentangle, a folk/jazz quintet he formed with fellow guitar virtuoso John Renbourn at the close of the 1960s, and a single live track from the group is collected here, the moody and stirring ~Bruton Town.~ Another highlight finds Renbourn joining Jansch for a wonderful twin acoustic guitar rendition of Charles Mingus' ~Goodbye Pork Pie Hat.~ There are several Jansch anthologies on the market, most of which contain pretty much the tracks you'll find here, so this works as well as any as an introduction. Castle's two-disc Dazzling Stranger might make the best choice, however, since it includes most of these cuts, plus a selection of his later work, as well.</p> <p>&mdash; <strong>Steve Leggett</strong></p>"

Presumably, they did it in order not to distract attention from Nude Ants, which was recorded a week after these concerts, but that never stopped them before from just piling on more discs. In any case, these Tokyo recordings were too good to hide; the quartet had reached an interactive creative high around this time, often burning at the rarified level that Nude Ants reached. Jarrett is both lyrically effusive and able to ignite his European colleagues into giving him more swinging support than on earlier sessions. In particular, the title track has a lot of the exploratory fervor of ~New Dance~ from Nude Ants, and ~Late Night Willie~ gets down deep into the Jarrett gospel feeling. Jan Garbarek is especially forthright in Tokyo on tenor, while his soprano pierces like a beam of sunlight, and Palle Danielsson (bass) and Jon Christensen (drums) are loose, relaxed, and impeccably recorded. Clearly this is one of the peaks of the European quartet's discography.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Richard S. Ginell</b></p>"

		"biography": "<p>Country blues guitarist and vocalist Blind Lemon Jefferson is indisputably one of the main figures in country blues. He was of the highest in many regards, being one of the founders of Texas blues (along with Texas Alexander), one of the most influential country bluesmen of all time, one of the most popular bluesmen of the 1920s, and the first truly commercially successful male blues performer. Up until Jefferson's achievements, the only real successful blues recordings were by women performers, including Bessie Smith and Ida Cox, who usually sang songs written by others and accompanied by a band. With Jefferson came a blues artist who was solo, self-accompanied, and performing a great deal of original material in addition to the more familiar repertoire of folk standards and shouts. These originals include his most well-known songs: ~Matchbox Blues,~ ~See That My Grave Is Kept Clean,~ and ~Black Snake Moan.~ In all, Blind Lemon Jefferson recorded almost 100 songs in just a few years, making his mark on not only the bluesmen of the time (including Leadbelly and Lightnin' Hopkins) but also on music fans in the years to come. The legacy of Jefferson's unique and powerful sound did not fade with the passing decades.</p><p>Many specifics on the life of Blind Lemon Jefferson are not available, but general information on the man and his career can be traced somewhat through recordings, a few public records, and the memories of those who knew him. Although his birth has long been placed in July of 1897, research almost a century later uncovered a census record that listed his birth in September of 1893. Despite the uncertainty surrounding his birth date, a few things are certain: Jefferson was born on a farm in Couchman, TX, outside of Wortham, and, blind from the time of birth, he grew up as one of seven children. Around 1912, he began playing guitar and singing at picnics and parties in his home area. His musical influences included not only the singing of the cotton pickers and local guitar players but also the guitarists among the area's Mexican workers who often incorporated flamenco patterns in their playing. These influences eventually led to Jefferson's unique style of complex phrases and intricate, yet fast, finger work. Within a couple of years, Jefferson widened his performing radius to include Groesbeck, Buffalo, Waco, and other surrounding towns. Sometime around 1915, Jefferson also began playing in Dallas and, by 1917, was a resident of the city. He was most often found playing in the Deep Ellum area of Dallas where he eventually met another bluesman who would one day be famous, Leadbelly. Although Leadbelly was the senior bluesman of the two, it is generally recognized that Jefferson was the better guitarist. Leadbelly was so impressed with Blind Lemon Jefferson, in fact, that he would later record songs in tribute to Jefferson's ability, including the song, ~Blind Lemon's Blues.~ The two men even played together for a short while, sometime before Leadbelly's first prison sentence.</p><p>From the late teens into the early '20s, Blind Lemon Jefferson traveled and performed his passionate brand of blues, hitting (at the very least) the Mississippi Delta and Memphis regions, although it is likely that his travels took him further. In 1922 or 1923 he married a woman named Roberta with whom he would have children, including a boy in the mid-'20s. It was in 1925 that a Texas talent scout finally made a demo recording of Jefferson and sent it to Mayo Williams at Paramount Records in Chicago. Jefferson was soon (circa 12/25 and 1/26) brought to Chicago to record for the first time. The results were two gospel songs: ~I Want to Be Like Jesus in My Heart~ and ~All I Want Is That Pure Religion,~ both of which were released under the pseudonym Deacon L.J. Bates. Two months later, Jefferson began recording blues 78s under his own name, but that initial session wasn't the last time Jefferson recorded under a pseudonym. In 1927, ~He Arose From the Dead~ and ~Where Shall I Be?~ were released under the names Deacon L.J. Bates and Elder J.C. Brown for the Paramount and Herwin labels, respectively. Jefferson recorded over 90 songs total in less than four years' time. Almost all of his recordings were for the Paramount label, with the exception of his two-day session for Okeh, which took place in Atlanta in March of 1927. This session resulted in the second version of ~That Black Snake Moan,~ (11/26) this time entitled ~Black Snake Moan,~ as well as the first recording of another song that became one of Jefferson's most famous originals, ~Matchbox Blues,~ which he recorded again for Paramount just one month later. Jefferson's records did well immediately, making him one of the best-selling race recording artists of the time. This is surprising considering his decidedly noncommercial sound; his high, eerie voice (often described as having a ~lonesome~ sound), the desperate (and sometimes suggestive) nature of his lyrics, and his often-complex guitar work all combined into a particularly raw and hard-hitting blues.</p><p>In addition to his frequent recording sessions in Chicago throughout the late '20s, Blind Lemon Jefferson still performed in Texas and traveled around the South. He played Chicago rent parties, performed at St. Louis' Booker T. Washington Theater, and even worked some with Son House collaborator Rev. Rubin Lacy while in Mississippi. In late September of 1929, Jefferson went to Paramount's studios in Richmond, IN, for a fruitful session that included two songs — ~Bed Springs Blues~ and ~Yo Yo Blues~ — that were also issued on the Broadway label. Jefferson was back in Chicago in December of 1929 when, sadly, he was found dead following a particularly cold snowstorm. There are several stories regarding his death: It has been said that he got lost in the storm after leaving a friend's party at a late hour, or that he was abandoned by his chauffeur, or was killed in a car accident, while yet another version claims Jefferson had a heart attack and froze in the snow. Regardless, the influential bluesman was still in his thirties when he died, and no death certificate was issued, so the date of his passing is only known to be toward the end of December. Pianist and labelmate Will Ezell escorted Jefferson's body back to Wortham, TX, where Blind Lemon Jefferson was laid to rest, purportedly on New Year's Day, 1930. Unfortunately for the author of the pleading ~See That My Grave Is Kept Clean,~ the grave itself went unmarked. This was finally remedied in 1967 when a metal Texas Historical Marker was placed on the approximate spot. By the 1990s, however, Jefferson's grave was discovered to be in disrepair. A fundraiser was organized and, thanks to the efforts and donations of blues fans around the world, a granite headstone was finally placed upon Jefferson's grave, inscribed with his lyric, ~Lord, it's one kind favor I'll ask of you. See that my grave is kept clean.~ It was also discovered during the preparation of the headstone that there is no support for the date widely believed to be that of Jefferson's birth — July 1897 (which even appeared on the original grave marker) — while the census documents in the State Archives listed Lemon Jefferson's birth to be in September of 1893. Thus, the new date was put on the gravestone.</p><p>Blind Lemon Jefferson was to Texas blues what Charley Patton was to Mississippi blues. His performances had a direct influence upon such legendary Texas musicians as Lightnin' Hopkins, T-Bone Walker, and Leadbelly, while his recordings helped bring his influence to an even larger audience. In the decades since, Jefferson's songs have been covered by countless musicians including Bob Dylan, John Hammond Jr., and Kelly Joe Phelps, to name just a few. The late '50s and early '60s brought the reissue of some of Jefferson's recordings on the Riverside and Milestone labels, sparking a renewal of widespread public interest in the bluesman. As a result, Blind Lemon Jefferson Clubs were opened in California and New York during the '60s, and the rock band Jefferson Airplane reputedly chose their name after the great bluesman. A good single album compiling selections of Jefferson's music remains the Yazoo label's appropriately titled <i>King of the Country Blues</i>, which was eventually remastered for CD release. For completists, the Document label has since issued his entire recorded works in a four-volume CD series. In 1980, Blind Lemon Jefferson was inducted into the Blues Foundation's Hall of Fame.</p><p> &mdash; <b>Joslyn Layne</b></p>",

Immensely popular, Jefferson's 78s were poorly pressed and frequently played, so these tracks have a good deal of surface hiss, which may be bothersome to some listeners.</p><p> &mdash; <b>Steve Leggett</b></p>"

				"review": "<p>When Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons released Screaming Targets in late 1979 it pushed them into the premier league. They'd already established themselves as one of the greatest pub-rocking acts of the day, having slogged around the touring circuit for over three years. Unfortunately, their first two albums hadn't sold very well but they finally made a chart impact when the 1978 single 'So Young' hit the Top 30. The perfect break-through act (to use some kind of industry parlance) was just about to hit the crest of the music wave.<p>And Screaming Targets did not disappoint – it was exceedingly accomplished, with a tough but accessible production sound courtesy of English producer Pete Solley and full of absolutely first-rate songs. The band's funky and energetic mix of R&B and soul had already done the job but it was when singer Joe Camilleri infused the music with a large dose of reggae rhythms that the hit singles arrived: 'Hit And Run' and 'Shape I'm In'. The album also caught the New Wave mood of the times with such outstanding album tracks as 'Don't Wanna Come Down', 'Close To The Bone', 'Thin Line' and Paul Kelly's 'Only The Lonely Hearted'. Elvis Costello would have killed to have written some of those riffs; in fact he must have been listening closely because he went on to record a version of 'So Young'.<p>The initial pressing of the album came with a bonus, limited edition live album of material recorded in Melbourne during April 1979. This was the band playing at the top of its game, featuring swampy and rockin' covers of 'Security', 'Not A Woman, Not A Child' and 'Mona', matched by 'So Young' and the 10-minute progressive rock epic 'The Cthulhu'. All are present and correct on Disc One of this collection.<p>I'd often been puzzled in the past when occasionally Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons would be compared to the Rolling Stones. After listening to Disc One non-stop for a couple of days… I get it now! Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons were out-Stonesing the Stones by a mile at the time. Man, these guys could rock – and of course the rhythm section of bassist John Power and drummer Gary Young was one of the tightest in the land. Add the high-tensile, interlocking guitar riffs of Jeff Burstin and Tony Faehse and the wailing sax lines of Camilleri and brother-in-crime Wilbur Wilde and you have an iconic band up there with the best throughout the history of Aussie rock.<p>Disc Two (entitled The Rhythm & Blues) keeps up the pace but not surprisingly it ranges all over the place, mixing previously unreleased demos (from 1976 up to the 2003 Ricochet album) with a whole raft of live cuts. It is staggering to consider that such incredible tracks as 'The Rhythm & Blues' (the band sounding like Rose Tattoo!), 'Rock It', 'Fix It Up', 'Hard Luck Story' and 'Ain't Got No Money' have never seen the light of day before.<p>Another rarity here is 'Glad I'm Living Here', taken from the original movie soundtrack to Oz: A Rock 'n' Roll Road Movie (1976). Which begs the question: where is the only other Mushroom rarity, the cover of Chuck Berry's 'Run, Rudolph, Run' (and its B-side for that matter, 'Guess Who') produced by Ross Wilson, issued as a single in 1975 and credited to Jo Jo Zep and His Little Helpers? David Laing described 'Run, Rudolph, Run' as “only a novelty song” but I see it as a missed opportunity on an otherwise fabulous release.<p><strong>&mdash;Ian McFarlane</strong></p>"

But it would be hard to find a better homage than this one. Dr. John proves a surprisingly good match for Ellington's material, placing a tremendously funky foundation under the composer's tunes. The sound is dominated by the good doctor's incomparable New Orleans piano and organ, naturally, and the best tracks are those whose melodies are carried solely by his keyboard work, such as instrumentals ~Caravan~ and ~Things Ain't What They Used to Be.~ The vocal cuts are fine &mdash; his takes on the Ellington ballad ~Solitude~ and especially the dreamy, elegant ~Mood Indigo~ show off Dr. John's uniquely expressive voice as well as any of his early-era recordings &mdash; though he occasionally tends to approach self-caricature, as on ~It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing).~ Any weakness, however, is more than made up for by the closing rearrangement of ~Flaming Sword,~ one of three Ellington rarities here. Dr. John transforms the instrumental into a luminous, gorgeously melodic display of Professor Longhair-style piano over an astonishingly sexy New Orleans funk rhythm. Ultimately, <I>Duke Elegant</I> holds up both as an innovative twist on the Ellington songbook and as a solid Dr. John album in its own right.</p><p> &mdash; <B> Kenneth Bays</B> &mdash; AllMusic</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mac ~Dr. John~ Rebennack playing songs from the canon of <A href=~http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/17834/002-9958316-7028034~>Duke Ellington</A> is as natural as the break of day. But the gris-gris king interprets Ellington in a way unlike anyone else. ~Mood Indigo,~ arranged for Dr. John's six-man New Orleans group, takes on a fresh, heartfelt immediacy with the good doctor's vocals and piano locked into a relaxed groove. He sings another slice of essential Ellingtonia, ~Do Nothing 'til You Hear from Me,~ with a lighthearted nonchalance that epitomizes the worthiest New Orleans performers. Dr. John  packages snippets of his keyboard playing as panaceas for the soul on a funked-up interpretation of ~Caravan,~ even spinning off on a ~Wade in the Water~ tangent before wrapping up the song. But with so many, many Ellington nuggets to dust off for reinterpretation, one wonders why Dr. John elected to go with popularnumbers that get covered again and again. To his credit, he does serve up the lesser-known ~The Flaming Sword,~ where his piano is luminous in the Calypso fashion of Professor Longhair, and he offers delightful, fonkified updates of the Ellington obscurities ~On the Wrong Side of the Railroad Tracks~ and ~I'm Gonna Go Fishin'.~</p><p> &mdash;<I>Frank-John Hadley</I> &mdash; AllMusic</p>"

Musically, it's Mac in his laid-back mode, but the band crackles a fair bit throughout. The centerpiece of this seven-track set is the ~Wade: Hurricane Suite~ consisting of the old spiritual ~Wade in the Water,~ improvised and extrapolated into four parts revisiting the levee breaks, storms, and catastrophes that have visited the Crescent City since history has been written. Mac plays his best jazz piano and organ as it has been influenced by deep blues, second line and old-school gospel and funk. The band, which includes John Fohl on guitar, bassist David Barard, and drummer Herman Everest II, sits tights with Mac's strolling and sometimes dramatic groove. The tunes are fine though the production feels sterile, too clean for the music, and that's a drawback. One would have liked to hear this band stretch out more and really click in a rawer setting on the suite because the blues are so prevalent in its construction and ripe for improvisation. But this mini album was recorded in New York and not at home, as has been his wont for a few years now. That's not to say that Sippiana Hericane is a disappointment, but it's not fully satisfactory either. The heartbreak and desperation are pervasive, but the rave-up sections don't quite climb out on the limb or out of the emotional basement either. The dissonance on ~Storm Surge,~ is wonderful, as each player follows Mac's lead into some angular yet no less vamp-based playing. The record feels ambivalent throughout, and perhaps it should, because the grief is genuine, but the rage that is touched on here, as well as the hope for a New Orleans that will be back ~twice as strong,~ feels reined in, and not allowed its full expression.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

		"name": "Robert Johnson",
		"biography": "<p>If the blues has a truly mythic figure, one whose story hangs over the music the way a Charlie Parker does over jazz or a Hank Williams does over country, it's Robert Johnson, certainly the most celebrated figure in the history of the blues. Of course, his legend is immensely fortified by the fact that Johnson also left behind a small legacy of recordings that are considered the emotional apex of the music itself. These recordings have not only entered the realm of blues standards (~Love in Vain,~ ~Crossroads,~ ~Sweet Home Chicago,~ ~Stop Breaking Down~), but were adapted by rock & roll artists as diverse as the Rolling Stones, Steve Miller, Led Zeppelin, and Eric Clapton. While there are historical naysayers who would be more comfortable downplaying his skills and achievements (most of whom have never made a convincing case as where the source of his apocalyptic visions emanates from), Robert Johnson remains a potent force to be reckoned with. As a singer, a composer, and as a guitarist of considerable skills, he produced some of the genre's best music and the ultimate blues legend to deal with. Doomed, haunted, driven by demons, a tormented genius dead at an early age, all of these add up to making him a character of mythology who -- if he hadn't actually existed -- would have to be created by some biographer's overactive romantic imagination.</p><p>The legend of his life -- which by now, even folks who don't know anything about the blues can cite to you chapter and verse -- goes something like this: Robert Johnson was a young black man living on a plantation in rural Mississippi. Branded with a burning desire to become great blues musician, he was instructed to take his guitar to a crossroad near Dockery's plantation at midnight. There he was met by a large black man (the Devil) who took the guitar from Johnson, tuned it, and handed it back to him. Within less than a year's time, in exchange for his everlasting soul, Robert Johnson became the king of the Delta blues singers, able to play, sing, and create the greatest blues anyone had ever heard.</p><p>As success came with live performances and phonograph recordings, Johnson remained tormented, constantly haunted by nightmares of hellhounds on his trail, his pain and mental anguish finding release only in the writing and performing of his music. Just as he was to be brought to Carnegie Hall to perform in John Hammond's first Spirituals to Swing concert, the news had come from Mississippi; Robert Johnson was dead, poisoned by a jealous girlfriend while playing a jook joint. Those who were there swear he was last seen alive foaming at the mouth, crawling around on all fours, hissing and snapping at onlookers like a mad dog. His dying words (either spoken or written on a piece of scrap paper) were, ~I pray that my redeemer will come and take me from my grave.~ He was buried in a pine box in an unmarked grave, his deal with the Devil at an end.</p><p>Of course, Johnson's influences in the real world were far more disparate than the legend suggests, no matter how many times it's been retold or embellished. As a teenage plantation worker, Johnson fooled with a harmonica a little bit, but seemingly had no major musical skills to speak of. Every attempt to sit in with local titans of the stature of Son House, Charley Patton, Willie Brown, and others brought howls of derision from the older bluesmen. Son House: ~We'd all play for the Saturday night balls, and there'd be this little boy hanging around. That was Robert Johnson. He blew a harmonica then, and he was pretty good at that, but he wanted to play a guitar. He'd sit at our feet and play during the breaks and such another racket you'd never heard.~ He married young and left Robinsonville, wandering the Delta and using Hazelhurst as base, determined to become a full-time professional musician after his first wife died during childbirth. Johnson returned to Robinsonville a few years later and he encountered House and Willie Brown at a juke joint in Banks, MS; according to House, ~When he finished all our mouths were standing open. I said, 'Well, ain't that fast! He's gone now!'~ To a man, there was only one explanation as how Johnson had gotten that good, that fast; he had sold his soul to the Devil.</p><p>But Johnson's skills were acquired in a far more conventional manner, born more of a concentrated Christian work ethic than a Faustian bargain with old Scratch. He idolized the Delta recording star Lonnie Johnson -- sometimes introducing himself to newcomers as ~Robert Lonnie, one of the Johnson brothers~ -- and the music of Scrapper Blackwell, Skip James, and Kokomo Arnold were all inspirational elements that he drew his unique style from. His slide style certainly came from hours of watching local stars like Charley Patton and Son House, among others. Perhaps the biggest influence, however, came from an unrecorded bluesman named Ike Zinneman. We'll never really know what Zinneman's music sounded like (we do know from various reports that he liked to practice late at night in the local graveyard, sitting on tombstones while he strummed away) or how much of his personal muse he imparted to Johnson, if any. What is known is that after a year or so under Zinneman's tutelage, Johnson returned with an encyclopedic knowledge of his instrument, an ability to sing and play in a multiplicity of styles, and a very carefully worked-out approach to song construction, keeping his original lyrics with him in a personal digest. As an itinerant musician, playing at country suppers as well as on the street, his audience demanded someone who could play and sing everything from blues pieces to the pop and hillbilly tunes of the day. Johnson's talents could cover all of that and more. His most enduring contribution, the boogie bass line played on the bottom strings of the guitar (adapted from piano players), has become part-and-parcel of the sound most people associate with down-home blues. It is a sound so very much of a part of the music's fabric that the listener cannot imagine the styles of Jimmy Reed, Elmore James, Eddie Taylor, Lightnin' Slim, Hound Dog Taylor, or a hundred lesser lights existing without that essential component part. As his playing partner Johnny Shines put it, ~Some of the things that Robert did with the guitar affected the way everybody played. He'd do rundowns and turnbacks. He'd do repeats. None of this was being done. In the early '30s, boogie on the guitar was rare, something to be heard. Because of Robert, people learned to complement theirselves, carrying their own bass as their own lead with this one instrument.~ While his music can certainly be put in context as part of a definable tradition, what he did with it and where he took it was another matter entirely.</p><p>Although Robert Johnson never recorded near as much as Lonnie Johnson, Charley Patton, or Blind Lemon Jefferson, he certainly traveled more than all of them put together. After his first recordings came out and ~Terraplane Blues~ became his signature tune (a so-called ~race~ record selling over three or four-thousand copies back in the early to mid-'30s was considered a hit), Johnson hit the road, playing anywhere and everywhere he could. Instilled with a seemingly unquenchable desire to experience new places and things, his wandering nature took him up and down the Delta and as far a field as St. Louis, Chicago, and Detroit (where he performed over the radio on the Elder Moten Hour), places Son House and Charley Patton had only seen in the movies, if that. But the end came at a Saturday-night dance at a juke joint in Three Forks, MS, in August of 1938. Playing with Honeyboy Edwards and Sonny Boy Williamson (Rice Miller), Johnson was given a jug of moonshine whiskey laced with either poison or lye, presumably by the husband of a woman the singer had made advances toward. He continued playing into the night until he was too sick to continue, then brought back to a boarding house in Greenwood, some 15 miles away. He lay sick for several days, successfully sweating the poison out of his system, but caught pneumonia as a result and died on August 16th. The legend was just beginning.</p><p>In the mid-'60s, Columbia Records released King of the Delta Blues Singers, the first compilation of Johnson's music and one of the earliest collections of pure country blues. Rife with liner notes full of romantic speculation, little in the way of hard information and a painting standing for a picture, this for years was the world's sole introduction to the music and the legend, doing much to promote both. A second volume -- collecting up the other master takes and issuing a few of the alternates -- was released in the '70s, giving fans a first-hand listen to music that had been only circulated through bootleg tapes and albums or cover versions by English rock stars. Finally in 1990 -- after years of litigation -- a complete two-CD box set was released with every scrap of Johnson material known to exist plus the holy grail of the blues; the publishing of the only two known photographs of the man himself. Columbia's parent company, Sony, was hoping that sales would maybe hit 20,000. The box set went on to sell over a million units, the first blues recordings ever to do so.</p><p>In the intervening years since the release of the box set, Johnson's name and likeness has become a cottage growth merchandising industry. Posters, postcards, t-shirts, guitar picks, strings, straps, and polishing cloths -- all bearing either his likeness or signature (taken from his second marriage certificate) -- have become available, making him the ultimate blues commodity with his image being reproduced for profit far more than any contemporary bluesman, dead or alive. Although the man himself (and his contemporaries) could never have imagined it in a million years, the music and the legend both live on.</p>&mdash; <b>Cub Koda</b>",

				"review": "<p>Reading about the power inherent in Robert Johnson's music is one thing, but actually experiencing it is another matter entirely. The official 1998 edition of the original 1961 album was certainly worth the wait, remastered off the best-quality original 78s available, of far superior quality to any of the source materials used on even the 1991 box set. Johnson's guitar takes on a fullness never heard on previous reissues, and except for a nagging hiss in spots on ~Terraplane Blues~ (the equalization on this disc is extreme to even sport some minute turntable rumble in the low end), this really brings his music alive. If there is such a thing as a greatest-hits package available on Johnson, this landmark album, which jump-started the whole '60s blues revival, would certainly be the one. The majority of Johnson's best-known tunes, the ones that made the legend, are all aboard: ~Crossroads,~ ~Walkin' Blues,~ ~Me & The Devil Blues,~ ~Come On In My Kitchen,~ and the apocalyptic visions contained in ~Hellhound On My Trail~ are the blues at its finest, the lyrics sheer poetry. And making its first appearance anywhere is a newly discovered-in-1998 alternate take of ~Traveling Riverside Blues~ that's appended to the original 16-track lineup. If you are starting your blues collection from the ground up, be sure to make this your very first purchase.</p>&mdash; <b>Cub Koda</b>"

The problems aren't in the music itself, of course, which is stunning and the fidelity of the recordings is the best it ever has been or ever will be. Instead, it's in the track sequencing. As the title implies, <i>The Complete Recordings</i> contains all of Johnson's recorded material, including a generous selection of alternate takes. All of the alternates are sequenced directly after the master, which can make listening to the album a little intimidating and tedious for novices. Certainly, the alternates can be programmed out with a CD player, but the set would have been more palatable if the alternate takes were presented on a separate disc. Nevertheless, this is a minor complaint -- Robert Johnson's music retains its power no matter what context it is presented in. He, without question, deserves this kind of deluxe box-set treatment.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<p>Even if B.B. King is the King of the Blues, some might find it strange that he chose to record <I>Let the Good Times Roll</I>, a tribute album to Louis Jordan, the King of Jump Blues. King's work was never as boisterous or enthusiastic as Jordan's, but his debt is apparent from the first cut of the album. King may have never done straight jump blues, but his sophisticated urban blues — complete with horn sections and an emphasis on vocals — shows as much jump influence as it does Delta.</p><p><I>Let the Good Times Roll</I> brings that home with a quiet, seductive insistence. Backed by a stellar band — featuring <A href=~javascript:z('Bos820rnac48p')~>Dr. John</A> on piano, drummer Earl Palmer, alto saxophonist Hank Crawford, and tenor saxophonist Dave ~Fathead~ Newman, among others — B.B. King sounds loose and natural. There are stars in the band, but this is hardly a bloated all-star effort, since the focus in on delivering no-nonsense performances. Strangely enough, King doesn't play that much guitar on the album, concentrating on his vocals and letting the band interact. When he does solo, it's as elegant and tasteful as always, but the focal point is always the songs. Since he's such a fine guitarist, B.B.'s singing often goes underappreciated, but here it's at the forefront, and he shines. His phrasing is impeccable, and he always captures the spirit of the songs, either through humor or heart. Of course, that's a skill that Jordan had, as well, and realizing that sheds new light on B.B.'s music. Much of his celebrated skills as a showman and a performer indirectly came from Jordan, as did elements of his musical style. Never has that been as clear as it is on <I>Let the Good Times Roll</I>.</p><p>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B> -- AllMusic</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Albums consisting entirely of one artist paying tribute to another arecommonplace, especially in the blues world where a particular artist'smusical heritage is easy to trace. It's rare, though, for an artist ofB.B. King's caliber to do such a tribute, and we're all lucky that theartist he chose to honor is Louis Jordan--the King of the Blues saluting the King of Swing. King'sclean, expressive guitar style and rough-hewn voice are so distinctivethat there's no mistaking them for anyone else's, and hearing them appliedto Jordan's classic songs--including ~Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens,~~Somebody Done Changed the Lock on My Door,~ ~Saturday Night Fish Fry,~and ~Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out~--demonstrates both King'sconsiderable skill and the great versatility of Jordan's songwriting. Thatmakes this record more than a mere curiosity, as does the stellar pianowork from another living legend, <A href=~http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/34011/002-9958316-7028034~>Dr. John</A>.</p> <p>--<b>Genevieve Williams</b> -- CDNow</p>"

		"biography": "<p>Initially embraced as ~the Southern Strokes~ for their resurrection and reinvention of Dixie-styled rock & roll, Kings of Leon steadily morphed themselves into an experimental rock outfit during the 2000s. The Tennessee-bred quartet debuted in 2003 with the Holy Roller Novocaine EP, whose blend of raw, unpolished boogie rock was further explored on their debut full-length, Youth & Young Manhood. Such revivalist music was matched by a similarly revivalist appearance -- including long hair, mustaches, and tight-fitting denim -- and Kings of Leon experienced immediate popularity in the U.K. (where they would later enjoy platinum album sales, despite an initially lukewarm reception at home). As the band explored different sonic textures with subsequent releases, most notably on 2007's Because of the Times and 2008's Only by the Night, those tenuous links to the Strokes were finally dissolved.</p><p>Comprised of three Followill brothers -- Caleb (guitar), Nathan (drums), and Jared (bass) -- as well as first cousin Matthew Followill (guitar), Kings of Leon formed in 2000. The Followill siblings had spent their youth traveling across America's heartland with their evangelist father, decamping at Pentecostal churches and tent revivals for several days at a time before moving onward. When their father resigned from the church and divorced his wife in 1997, the boys relocated to Nashville and embraced the rock music (not to mention the accompanying lifestyle) they'd previously been denied. Cousin Matthew was added to the lineup, and a Southern garage rock sound quickly emerged. RCA took note, signing the band in 2001 and facilitating a partnership with Nashville-based producer Angelo Petraglia, who furthered the band's rock & roll education and co-wrote the material for 2003's Holy Roller Novocaine EP.</p><p>Tours across North America and the U.K. coincided with the release of the band's full-length debut, Youth & Young Manhood, that same summer. Buoyed by the single ~Molly's Chambers,~ the album saw moderate success in the U.K. However, it was their sophomore effort, 2004's Aha Shake Heartbreak, that made them European stars, with three songs cracking the U.K. singles charts. The album saw an American release in February 2005, and Kings of Leon toured the country alongside U2 before retreating to work on their third effort. The darker, more expansive Because of the Times followed in 2007. Featuring production from Ethan Johns (who had helmed the band's previous releases as well), the album proved to be the band's biggest release, debuting at number 25 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and topping the album charts in the U.K., Ireland, and New Zealand.</p><p>Kings of Leon returned the following year with Only by the Night, another expansive album whose lead single, ~Sex on Fire,~ gave the band its first number one single in the U.K. The album fared similarly well, topping the U.K. charts upon its release and debuting at number four in America. It eventually gained platinum status in eight countries, including America, and its success allowed the band to tour heavily throughout much of 2008 and 2009. Live at the O2</p>",

In fact, if Alan Parsons lent the Allman Brothers his spaceship, Because of the Times would be the resulting space odyssey. While that leads to some intriguing moments, the general move away from strong, hooky choruses to a focus on expansive, intricate and percussive arrangements may challenge casual and even some longtime fans of the band's catchy, Southern garage rock twang. That said, cuts like the atmospheric and brooding lead-off track ~Knocked Up~ showcase lead-singer Caleb Followill's growing maturity as a singer and lyricist and bring to mind favorable comparisons to such artists as Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen. Similarly, the moody single ~On Call~ as well as the roiling, dramatic ~McFearless,~ while not immediately hummable, do sink into your memory revealing layers of melody and emotion on repeated listens.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Matt Collar</strong></p>"

His group, Dire Straits, was formed in London in 1977 and went on to become an international success after the release of its debut album in 1978. Though it began as a group with a permanent lineup led by Knopfler, in its first few years it evolved into a brand name for Knopfler with varying personnel. Starting with Local Hero in 1983, Knopfler has scored several motion pictures. He has also recorded with Chet Atkins and with the Notting Hillbillies. In 1995, Knopfler quietly laid Dire Straits to rest. He launched a full-fledged solo career with the release of Golden Heart in 1996; subsequent soundtrack efforts include 1998's Wag the Dog, 1998's Metroland, and 2002's Shot at Glory. Sailing to Philadelphia, a lush collection of folk-rock and breezy Americana that featured guest appearances by James Taylor, Van Morrison, and Squeeze leaders Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford, appeared in fall 2000, and Ragpicker's Dream followed in 2002. In 2003, on the way to rehearsals in London, Knopfler broke his collarbone, shoulder, and seven ribs in a motorcycle crash. He returned in 2004 with Shangri-La, and in 2006 he completed All the Road Running, a collaboration with Emmylou Harris recorded over the span of nearly seven years that also found life as a live CD/DVD release (Real Live Roadrunning) later that November. Kill to Get Crimson appeared in 2007, and Get Lucky in 2009.</p>",

The low-key music picks up traces of Scottish music, but most of it just sounds like Dire Straits doing instrumentals, especially the recurring theme, one of Knopfler's more memorable melodies.

				"review": "<p>Mark Knopfler's now produced more studio albums as a solo artist, than he did with the band that he will forever be remembered for, Dire Straits. Discounting various soundtracks and side projects, his seventh solo outing Privateering is an ambitious double record that continues his latter day purple patch. Equal helpings of Celtic inspired folk, traditional blues, country, and that Geordie sense of humour, make the 20 tracks here less of a marathon, and more a stroll down memory lane.</p><p>It's also clear that the break in recording to join a European leg of Bob Dylan's Never Ending Tour, helped to galvanise the material. There's a loose theme about life on the road to be found, signalled by the historic naval roots of the album title itself. The act of Privateering was to join the crew of a privately owned vessel to aid the state during wartime. A modern interpretation of that could well be to join a band and make a stand against the world around you.</p><p>It seems that is Knopfler's intention here as some gentle political commentary occasionally bubbles to the surface (The cash in hand scraping by of 'Corned Beef City' springs to mind.). Even the album cover of a beaten up van suggests a touring mentality, and a brief glimpse of the track listing indicates an ever-changing landscape (for example 'Redbud Tree' and 'Seattle'). With a six night stint booked at the Royal Albert Hall next year, it seems that Knopfler is also very at home on tour, and Privateering will serve well to bolster an already expansive set list for those shows.</p><p>One of the standout tracks 'Radio City Serenade' starts with one of the most memorable lyrics from the record; ~You've got to have no credit cards, to know how good it feels~. Knopfler is pining for a more simple time as trumpets, guitars and violins create a bustling cityscape in his ode to New York. Elsewhere a character from a Dire Straits song seems to have been given a blues makeover. 'Hot Or Not' has that swaggering almost spoken vocal delivery that Knopfler first used on 'My Parties' (which can be found on Dire Straits' final album On Every Street). But here, instead of a comment on yuppie culture, he re-imagines the protagonist as a Mississippi delta gambler on a winning streak (~I'll read 'em like a book. Let's go have a drink or two and talk about the scalps I took.~). With a traditional blues backing complete with harmonica and piano it's the perfect atmosphere for Knopfler to pull out one of his trademark solos too.</p><p>That's perhaps the point of Privateering, no matter where Knopfler takes the listener on his whistle stop tour of musical styles, his unique guitar picking is never far away. While some of the lyrics are world weary and tinged with regret, there's a certain joy to be found in his chameleonic guitar playing. Knopfler's also put together a very versatile band which shares the spotlight on many occasions. He may well be the captain of this ship, but it's his crew that keep it on course. While those hoping that Knopfler may be heading back to safer waters may be disappointed here, he's embraced roots music wholeheartedly and with some real success.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Jim Pusey.</strong></p>"

		"biography": "<p>Though he formed the Saints with Chris Bailey in 1975, Ed Kuepper left the band before its biggest popular success (though after its best recordings). The Saints were one of Australia's premier punk bands, and Kuepper played on two albums before leaving in 1979 to form the Laughing Clowns, a band whose sound was more jazzy and quite a bit more experimental than his former group. The Laughing Clowns released three EPs during the early '80s before their debut self-titled album appeared in 1982. Kuepper led the band through four additional albums, but became a solo act beginning with the surprisingly pop-oriented Electrical Storm in 1986. After another pop album, Rooms of the Magnificent, Capitol took a chance on Kuepper and signed him; his response was Everybody's Got To, his third great pop album in a row. Nevertheless, it failed to click with radio programmers or the public.</p><p>Capitol later dropped Kuepper and he responded in 1990 with the acoustic, stripped-back Today Wonder. One year later, he formed the Aints -- a jab at Chris Bailey, who continued to use the Saints' name during the '80s and '90s -- to release Ascension. He returned to solo status in 1992, and began a string of seven studio LPs over the next four years, plus two mail-order-only albums and a best-of entitled Sings His Greatest Hits. Despite his very appreciative cult of fans and torrid release schedule, Ed Kuepper has not managed a breakthrough to wide popular acclaim.</p>&mdash; <b>John Bush</b>  ",

Specifically, it's the way around close, quiet, but still tense and strong performances, evident on such later releases as I Was a Mail Order Bridegroom. In the reissue, Kuepper notes how he and drummer Mark Dawson wanted to avoid ~the usual 'doing the greatest hits acoustically' routine,~ and in a series of rehearsals for a tour start tried other approaches with newer songs or cover versions. Dawson himself plays a stripped-down set -- partially using a cardboard box -- while Kuepper uses a variety of unexpected tunings on his guitar, as well as using his familiar, rich voice. The end result's a beauty of a record, captured well on tape with just enough echo (Kuepper semi-jokingly calls the effect ~ambient rockabilly,~ and certainly on songs like ~Always the Woman Pays~ it could be the Durutti Column at Sun Studios). One of Kuepper's all-time classics, ~Everything I've Got Belongs to You,~ made its first bow here, the killer opening line, ~I've designs on you that come from dirty books~ still a winner, while an earlier sample of his brilliance, the Saints' ~Eternally Yours,~ also takes a bow. Covers include Tim Hardin's ~If I Were a Carpenter~ and the title track, actually a medley with Donovan and the Animals adding to Kuepper's original, while self-penned highlights include ~What You Don't Know,~ with a nervous, dramatic edge, and the gentler-paced but not-less-commanding ~There's Nothing Natural.~ The radio-set extras add even more of a frenetic charge to the more commanding songs -- ~Always the Woman Pays~ practically leaps out at the listener and ~Pretty Mary~ isn't far behind.</p>&mdash; <b>Ned Raggett</b>"

		"name": "K.D. Lang",
		"biography": "<p>When k.d. lang released her first major-label album in 1987, she caused considerable controversy within the traditional world of country music. With her vaguely campy approach, androgynous appearance, and edgy, rock-inflected music, very few observers knew what to make of her or her music, although no one questioned her considerable vocal talents. That confusion never quite dissipated over the course of her career, even when she abandoned country music for torchy adult contemporary pop in 1992 with her fourth album, Ingenue.</p><p>Born in Alberta, Canada, lang was first drawn toward music while she was in college. In particular, she was attracted to the music of Patsy Cline. She became acquainted with Cline's music while she was preparing to star in a collegiate theatrical production based on the vocalist's life. Soon, lang immersed herself within Cline's life and music and decided that she would pursue a career as a professional singer. With the help of guitarist/co-songwriter Ben Mink, she formed a band, named the re-clines in tribute to Patsy Cline, in 1983, and they recorded a debut album, <i>Friday Dance Promenade</i>, which received some positive notices in independent papers. A follow-up album, <i>A Truly Western Experience</i>, was released in 1984 and received even better reviews and led to national attention. In 1985, lang was named the Most Promising Female Vocalist by the Juno Awards.</p><p>All of the Canadian attention led to the interest of a number of American record labels. Sire signed lang in early 1986, and she recorded her first record for the label later that year. The result, Angel With a Lariat, was produced by Dave Edmunds and appeared in the fall of 1986. The mix of '50s-styled ballads, kitschy rockabilly, and honky tonk numbers on Angel With a Lariat received good reviews, especially from rock critics. The album had heavy support from college radio as well as cutting-edge country stations. Though it was a mainstream hit in Canada and an underground smash in the U.S., Nashville resisted lang, especially her tongue-in-cheek concert appearances. As she was recording her second Nashville album in 1987, lang duetted with Roy Orbison on his old hit ~Crying,~ which was recorded for the film Hiding Out. The single was released at the end of the year and was hit, marking her first appearance on the country charts.</p><p>Shadowland, her second Sire album, made her debt to Patsy Cline explicit. Recorded with Cline's producer, Owen Bradley, the album lacked the campy humor of Angel With a Lariat, which helped it succeed in traditional country circles -- ~I'm Down to My Last Cigarette,~ the first single from the record, was her first to break the country Top 40. Shadowland became a sizable word-of-mouth hit, both in modern country and alternative music circles, which led to it going gold. The following year lang released the harder-edged Absolute Torch and Twang, which increased her mainstream American country audience, in addition to being a college radio and Canadian hit. lang won a Grammy -- Best Country Vocal Performance, Female -- for the album in 1989, and ~Full Moon of Love~ became a Top 25 hit in the summer of 1989. The attention made lang a minor celebrity, which meant that when she launched a protest against meat eating in 1990, it became a media sensation.</p><p>Before the release of her fourth album, lang declared that she was a lesbian in an interview in The Advocate, which could have been a risky proposition, since Nashville's industry was notorious for not accepting people that fell outside of the margins of the mainstream. However, the new album was not a country album. Ingenue was a set of adult contemporary pop that owed very little to country. Its first single, ~Constant Craving,~ became a Top 40 American hit and won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female, leading the album to platinum status in America, Britain, and Australia; it went double platinum in Canada.</p><p>Ingenue won lang a new audience, but she didn't immediately produce a follow-up to the album. Instead, her next recorded work was the largely instrumental soundtrack for Gus Van Zant's film adaptation of Tom Robbins' Even Cowgirls Get the Blues in 1993; the soundtrack was actually released several months before the before the film. It wasn't until 1995 that lang delivered All You Can Eat, her full-fledged follow-up to Ingenue. All You Can Eat continued the pop direction of its predecessor, showing no traces of country. The album didn't enjoy the mass commercial acceptance of Ingenue, but it was a moderate success, proving that she had a dedicated cult following. lang continued to follow her pop-oriented instincts on 2000's Invincible Summer, while embracing traditional popular standards on 1997's Drag (a collection of songs about smoking) and in her duet with Tony Bennett on his 2001 set Playing With My Friends: Bennett Sings The Blues. (lang also went out on the road with Bennett for a successful co-headlining concert tour.) In 2004, after lang's contract with Sire Records ran its course, she signed with the artist-friendly Nonesuch imprint and recorded Hymns of the 49th Parallel, a collection of tunes by Canadian songwriters.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>",

It's hard to say what Stompin' Tom thinks about lang these days, now that she's an out-of-the-closet lesbian, an animal rights activist, and (gulp) spending most of her time in America, but it's a good bet he approves of Hymns of the 49th Parallel, in which lang turns her attention exclusively to the work of Canadian tunesmiths. Anchored by classic songs from Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, and Leonard Cohen (all of whom rate two songs each), Hymns of the 49th Parallel is not so much a flag-waving celebration of Canada as an appreciation of the often spare and evocative style of its best-known lyricists (or at least that's the case with the material on board), and lang and frequent collaborator Ben Mink have matched the selections with production and arrangements that are simple and to the point, with only a piano/bass/drums trio for accompaniment (though a string section pops in every once in a while). With her phrasing subdued and her projection scaled back from the big-as-all-outdoors sound of her early days, lang seems to have kept her own instrument in check as well, though her best moments still inspire a very real awe. Though lang has chosen some superb songs (and written a fine one herself in the album's only original, ~Simple~) and performed them with obvious love and affection, Hymns of the 49th Parallel seems oddly lacking in passion; perhaps in deference to the frozen North, this album has a cool and frosty undertow that seems designed to hold the listener at arm's length, despite the inarguable beauty of its craft. Perhaps for the follow-up, she should bring in Stompin' Tom for a duet on ~The Hockey Song~ to liven things up.</i>&mdash; <b>Mark Deming </b>"

		"lastname": "Led Zeppelin",
		"name": "Led Zeppelin",
		"biography": "<p>Led Zeppelin was the definitive heavy metal band. It wasn't just their crushingly loud interpretation of the blues -- it was how they incorporated mythology, mysticism, and a variety of other genres (most notably world music and British folk) -- into their sound. Led Zeppelin had mystique. They rarely gave interviews, since the music press detested the band. Consequently, the only connection the audience had with the band was through the records and the concerts. More than any other band, Led Zeppelin established the concept of album-oriented rock, refusing to release popular songs from their albums as singles. In doing so, they established the dominant format for heavy metal, as well as the genre's actual sound.</p><p>Led Zeppelin formed out of the ashes of the Yardbirds. Jimmy Page had joined the band in its final days, playing a pivotal role on their final album, 1967's <i>Little Games</i>, which also featured string arrangements from John Paul Jones. During 1967, the Yardbirds were fairly inactive. While the Yardbirds decided their future, Page returned to session work in 1967. In the spring of 1968, he played on Jones' arrangement of Donovan's ~Hurdy Gurdy Man.~ During the sessions, Jones requested to be part of any future project Page would develop. Page would have to assemble a band sooner than he had planned. In the summer of 1968, the Yardbirds' Keith Relf and James McCarty left the band, leaving Page and bassist Chris Dreja with the rights to the name, as well as the obligation of fulfilling an upcoming fall tour. Page set out to find a replacement vocalist and drummer. Initially, he wanted to enlist singer Terry Reid and Procol Harum's drummer B.J. Wilson, but neither musician was able to join the group. Reid suggested that Page contact Robert Plant, who was singing with a band called Hobbstweedle.</p><p>After hearing him sing, Page asked Plant to join the band in August of 1968, the same month Chris Dreja dropped out of the new project. Following Dreja's departure, John Paul Jones joined the group as its bassist. Plant recommended that Page hire John Bonham, the drummer for Plant's old band, the Band of Joy. Bonham had to be persuaded to join the group, as he was being courted by other artists who offered the drummer considerably more money. By September, Bonham agreed to join the band. Performing under the name the New Yardbirds, the band fulfilled the Yardbirds' previously booked engagements in late September 1968. The following month, they recorded their debut album in just under 30 hours. Also in October, the group switched its name to Led Zeppelin. The band secured a contract with Atlantic Records in the United States before the end of the year. Early in 1969, Led Zeppelin set out on their first American tour, which helped set the stage for the January release of their eponymous debut album. Two months after its release, Led Zeppelin had climbed into the U.S. Top Ten. Throughout 1969, the band toured relentlessly, playing dates in America and England. While they were on the road, they recorded their second album, <i>Led Zeppelin II</i>, which was released in October of 1969. Like its predecessor, <i>Led Zeppelin II</i> was an immediate hit, topping the American charts two months after its release and spending seven weeks at number one. The album helped establish Led Zeppelin as an international concert attraction, and for the next year, the group continued to tour relentlessly. Led Zeppelin's sound began to deepen with <i>Led Zeppelin III</i>. Released in October of 1970, the album featured an overt British folk influence. The group's infatuation with folk and mythology would reach a fruition on the group's untitled fourth album, which was released in November of 1971. <i>Led Zeppelin IV</i> was the band's most musically diverse effort to date, featuring everything from the crunching rock of ~Black Dog~ to the folk of ~The Battle of Evermore,~ as well as ~Stairway to Heaven,~ which found the bridge between the two genres. ~Stairway to Heaven~ was an immediate radio hit, eventually becoming the most played song in the history of album-oriented radio; the song was never released as a single. Despite the fact that the album never reached number one in America, Led Zeppelin IV was their biggest album ever, selling well over 16 million copies over the next two and a half decades.</p><p>Led Zeppelin did tour to support both <i>Led Zeppelin III</i> and <i>Led Zeppelin IV</i>, but they played fewer shows than they did on their previous tours. Instead, they concentrated on only playing larger venues. After completing their 1972 tour, the band retreated from the spotlight and recorded their fifth album. Released in the spring of 1973, <i>Houses of the Holy</i> continued the band's musical experimentation, featuring touches of funk and reggae among their trademark rock and folk. The success of Houses of the Holy set the stage for a record-breaking American tour. Throughout their 1973 tour, Led Zeppelin broke box-office records -- most of which were previously held by the Beatles -- across America. The group's concert at Madison Square Garden in July was filmed for use in the feature film The Song Remains the Same, which was released three years later. After their 1973 tour, Led Zeppelin spent a quiet year during 1974, releasing no new material and performing no concerts. They did, however, establish their own record label, Swan Song, which released all of Led Zeppelin's subsequent albums, as well as records by Dave Edmunds, Bad Company, the Pretty Things, and several others. <i>Physical Graffiti</i>, a double album released in February of 1975, was the band's first release on Swan Song. The album was an immediate success, topping the charts in both America and England. Led Zeppelin launched a large American tour in 1975, but it came to a halt when Robert Plant and his wife suffered a serious car crash while vacationing in Greece. The tour was canceled and Plant spent the rest of the year recuperating from the accident.</p><p>Led Zeppelin returned to action in the spring of 1976 with <i>Presence</i>. Although the album debuted at number one in both America and England, the reviews for the album were lukewarm, as was the reception to the live concert film The Song Remains the Same, which appeared in the fall of 1976. The band finally returned to tour America in the Spring of 1977. A couple of months into the tour, Plant's six-year-old son Karac died of a stomach infection. Led Zeppelin immediately canceled the tour and offered no word whether or not it would be rescheduled, causing widespread speculation about the band's future. For a while, it did appear that Led Zeppelin was finished. Robert Plant spent the latter half of 1977 and the better part of 1978 in seclusion. The group didn't begin work on a new album until late in the summer of 1978, when they began recording at ABBA's Polar studios in Sweden. A year later, the band played a short European tour, performing in Switzerland, Germany, Holland, Belgium, and Austria. In August of 1979, Led Zeppelin played two large concerts at Knebworth; the shows would be their last English performances.</p><p><i>In Through the Out Door</i>, the band's much-delayed eighth studio album, was finally released in September of 1979. The album entered the charts at number one in both America and England. In May of 1980, Led Zeppelin embarked on their final European tour. In September, Led Zeppelin began rehearsing at Jimmy Page's house in preparation for an American tour. On September 25, John Bonham was found dead in his bed -- following an all-day drinking binge, he had passed out and choked on his own vomit. In December of 1980, Led Zeppelin announced they were disbanding, since they could not continue without Bonham.</p><p>Following the breakup, the remaining members all began solo careers. John Paul Jones returned to producing and arranging, finally releasing his solo debut, <i>Zooma</i>, in 1999. After recording the soundtrack for <i>Death Wish II</i>, Jimmy Page compiled the Zeppelin outtakes collection <i>Coda</i>, which was released at the end of 1982. That same year, Robert Plant began a solo career with the <i>Pictures at Eleven</i> album. In 1984, Plant and Page briefly reunited in the all-star oldies band the Honeydrippers. After recording one EP with the Honeydrippers, Plant returned to his solo career and Page formed the Firm with former Bad Company singer Paul Rogers. In 1985, Led Zeppelin reunited to play Live Aid, sparking off a flurry of reunion rumors; the reunion never materialized. In 1988, the band re-formed to play Atlantic's 25th anniversary concert. During 1989, Page remastered the band's catalog for release on the 1990 box set <i>Led Zeppelin</i>. The four-disc set became the biggest-selling multi-disc box set of all time, which was followed up three years later by another box set, the mammoth ten-disc set <i>The Complete Studio Recordings</i>.</p><p>In 1994, Page and Plant reunited to record a segment for MTV Unplugged, which was released as <i>No Quarter</i> in the fall of 1994. Although the album went platinum, the sales were disappointing considering the anticipation of a Zeppelin reunion. The following year, Page and Plant embarked on a successful international tour, which eventually led to an all-new studio recording in 1998, the Steve Albini-produced <i>Walking Into Clarksdale</i>. Surprisingly, the album was met with a cool reception by the record-buying public, as Page and Plant ended their union shortly thereafter, once again going their separate ways (Page would go on to tour with the Black Crowes, while Plant would resume his solo career). Further Zeppelin compilation releases saw the light of day in the late-'90s, including 1997's stellar double-disc <i>BBC Sessions</i>, plus Zep's first true best-of collections -- 1999's <i>Early Days: The Best Of, Vol. 1</i> and 2000's <i>Latter Days: The Best Of, Vol. 2</i>.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>",

				"review": "<p>Led Zeppelin had a fully formed, distinctive sound from the outset, as their eponymous debut illustrates. Taking the heavy, distorted electric blues of Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, and Cream to an extreme, Zeppelin created a majestic, powerful brand of guitar rock constructed around simple, memorable riffs and lumbering rhythms. But the key to the group's attack was subtlety: it wasn't just an onslaught of guitar noise; it was shaded and textured, filled with alternating dynamics and tempos. As Led Zeppelin proves, the group was capable of such multi-layered music from the start. Although the extended psychedelic blues of ~Dazed and Confused,~ ~You Shook Me,~ and ~I Can't Quit You Baby~ often gather the most attention, the remainder of the album is a better indication of what would come later. ~Babe I'm Gonna Leave You~ shifts from folky verses to pummeling choruses; ~Good Times Bad Times~ and ~How Many More Times~ have groovy, bluesy shuffles; ~Your Time Is Gonna Come~ is an anthemic hard rocker; ~Black Mountain Side~ is pure English folk; and ~Communication Breakdown~ is a frenzied rocker with a nearly punkish attack. Although the album isn't as varied as some of their later efforts, it nevertheless marked a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal.</p><p>[Led Zeppelin launched a massive reissue campaign in 2014, supervised by Jimmy Page. The album proper has been remastered but the centerpiece for this deluxe edition, as it is for its companion reissues, is an additional disc of unreleased bonus material. Page dug through the Zeppelin archives to find rare -- and often un-bootlegged -- recordings, relying on alternate mixes and backing tracks but occasionally excavating unheard songs. However, the music contained on the deluxe edition of Led Zeppelin does not fall into these categories. The entire disc of bonus material is dedicated to a concert given at the Olympia in Paris in 1969, right between the recordings of the debut LP and Led Zeppelin II. This tape has been bootlegged before; indeed, it came to Page's attention relatively recently -- somewhere between the release of Mothership and Celebration Day -- and it was e-mailed to him by a fan. What's presented here is edited slightly from that version -- ~How Many More Years~ suffers the most, cut from its original 20 minutes by nearly ten minutes, and there are slices made to the guitar solo on ~Heartbreaker~ and ~Moby Dick~ has been truncated -- but most listeners won't much care because what's presented is so powerful. Often, the group drifts into endless jams -- ~Dazed and Confused~ clocks in at 15 minutes, ~You Shook Me~ at nearly 12 -- but this never seems ponderous, possibly because it opens with a version of ~Good Times Bad Times~ that the group quickly abandons for an insanely fast ~Communication Breakdown,~ playing it as if they were sprinting to the finish. It's not tight but that's its appeal, as it shows how the band was a vital, living beast, playing differently on-stage than they did in the studio. This is also true of the liquid psychedelia of their blues -- they never miss an opportunity to sink into an endless groove but there's a kineticism to the interplay that almost always prevents it from seeming ponderous (the exception is, as ever, ~Moby Dick,~ whose success relies entirely on your personal taste for drum solos). Zeppelin never felt this nervy again: they harnessed their majesty and knew how to deploy it, but here it still seems like they weren't quite sure of their limits, which is why it's a particularly exciting bonus disc.]</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine - 2015</strong></p>"

				"review": "<P>Recorded quickly during Led Zeppelin's first American tours, Led Zeppelin II provided the blueprint for all the heavy metal bands that followed it. Since the group could only enter the studio for brief amounts of time, most of the songs that compose II are reworked blues and rock &amp; roll standards that the band was performing on-stage at the time. Not only did the short amount of time result in a lack of original material, it made the sound more direct. Jimmy Page still provided layers of guitar overdubs, but the overall sound of the album is heavy and hard, brutal and direct. ~Whole Lotta Love,~ ~The Lemon Song,~ and ~Bring It on Home~ are all based on classic blues songs -- only, the riffs are simpler and louder and each song has an extended section for instrumental solos. Of the remaining six songs, two sport light acoustic touches (~Thank You,~ ~Ramble On~), but the other four are straight-ahead heavy rock that follows the formula of the revamped blues songs. While Led Zeppelin II doesn't have the eclecticism of the group's debut, it's arguably more influential. After all, nearly every one of the hundreds of Zeppelin imitators used this record, with its lack of dynamics and its pummeling riffs, as a blueprint.</P>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B>"

				"review": "<p>Led Zeppelin's BBC sessions were among the most popular bootleg items of the rock & roll era, appearing on a myriad of illegal records and CDs. They were all the more popular because of the lack of official Led Zeppelin live albums, especially since The Song Remains the Same failed to capture the essence of the band. For anyone who hadn't heard the recordings, the mystique of Zeppelin's BBC sessions was somewhat mystifying, but the official 1997 release of the double-disc BBC Sessions offered revelations for any fan who hadn't yet heard this music. While some collectors will be dismayed by the slight trimming on the ~Whole Lotta Love Medley,~ almost all of the group's sessions are included here, and they prove why live Zeppelin was the stuff of legend. The 1969 sessions, recorded shortly after the release of the first album, are fiery and dynamic, outstripping the studio record for sheer power. Early versions of ~You Shook Me,~ ~Communication Breakdown,~ ~What Is and What Should Never Be,~ and ~Whole Lotta Love~ hit harder than their recorded counterparts, while covers of Sleepy John Estes' ~The Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair,~ Robert Johnson's ~Travelling Riverside Blues,~ and Eddie Cochran's ~Something Else~ are welcome additions to the Zeppelin catalog, confirming their folk, blues, and rockabilly roots as well as their sense of vision. Zeppelin's grand vision comes into sharper relief on the second disc, which is comprised of their 1971 sessions. They still have their primal energy, but they're more adventurous, branching out into folk, twisted psychedelia, and weird blues-funk. Certainly, BBC Sessions is the kind of album that will only appeal to fans, but anyone who's ever doubted Zeppelin's power or vision will be set straight with this record.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Encompassing heavy metal, folk, pure rock & roll, and blues, Led Zeppelin's untitled fourth album is a monolithic record, defining not only Led Zeppelin but the sound and style of '70s hard rock. Expanding on the breakthroughs of III, Zeppelin fuse their majestic hard rock with a mystical, rural English folk that gives the record an epic scope. Even at its most basic -- the muscular, traditionalist ~Rock and Roll~ -- the album has a grand sense of drama, which is only deepened by Robert Plant's burgeoning obsession with mythology, religion, and the occult. Plant's mysticism comes to a head on the eerie folk ballad ~The Battle of Evermore,~ a mandolin-driven song with haunting vocals from Sandy Denny, and on the epic ~Stairway to Heaven.~ Of all of Zeppelin's songs, ~Stairway to Heaven~ is the most famous, and not unjustly. Building from a simple fingerpicked acoustic guitar to a storming torrent of guitar riffs and solos, it encapsulates the entire album in one song. Which, of course, isn't discounting the rest of the album. ~Going to California~ is the group's best folk song, and the rockers are endlessly inventive, whether it's the complex, multi-layered ~Black Dog,~ the pounding hippie satire ~Misty Mountain Hop,~ or the funky riffs of ~Four Sticks.~ But the closer, ~When the Levee Breaks,~ is the one song truly equal to ~Stairway,~ helping give IV the feeling of an epic. An apocalyptic slice of urban blues, ~When the Levee Breaks~ is as forceful and frightening as Zeppelin ever got, and its seismic rhythms and layered dynamics illustrate why none of their imitators could ever equal them.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<P>This double-DVD set includes over five hours of never-before-available concert and performance footage from Led Zeppelin, spanning the years 1969 to 1979. While enthusiasts have been trading poor quality versions of this material for years, this marks the first archival video release to contain any footage of the band playing live. The main feature on the first disc includes highlights of the band's legendary set at the Royal Albert Hall on January 9, 1970. If there was ever any doubt of the power and intricate legerdemain of Jimmy Page (guitar), Robert Plant (vocal/harmonica), John Paul Jones (bass/keyboards/mandolin), and John Bonham (drums), this performance will silence all detractors. The dozen songs from this show are derived primarily from their first two LPs with a few well-chosen covers thrown in for good measure. One particularly interesting inclusion is Plant's spontaneous incorporation of a few lines from Neil Young's ~Down by the River~ and ~On the Way Home~ during an epic ~How Many More Times.~ Supplementary shorts on disc one feature a promotional video for ~Communication Breakdown~ -- with the band miming to a pre-recorded audio track -- a half-hour mini-show for Danish Television, a clip of ~Dazed and Confused~ from the British TV program Supershow, and a pair of tunes (~Communication Breakdown~ and ~Dazed and Confused~) for the French TV show Tous en Scene.</P><P>The second DVD fast forwards to the '70s and continues with a trio of main attractions and a slew of extras. First up is a composite video for ~Immigrant Song,~ which contains some amateur footage married to a previously unissued live version of the song. This is followed by outtakes from the motion picture Song Remains the Same (1976), which finds the quartet at Madison Square Garden in 1973. The oft-bootlegged 1975 Earls Court is up next highlighted by acoustic renderings of ~Going to California~ and ~That's the Way.~ The last extended set finds Zep during their triumphant return to England in 1979. It would ultimately be a bittersweet affair as it was likewise their final performance in their homeland prior to the death of Bonham the following year. Extras on disc two include a few interview clips, promotional videos for ~Over the Hills and Far Away,~ and ~Travelling Riverside Blues~ -- both circa the Led Zeppelin (1990) four-CD box set.</P>— <B>Lindsay Planer</B>"

				"review": "<p>Led Zeppelin's reunion for an Ahmet Ertegun tribute concert in November 2007 (pushed back a couple of weeks due to a finger injury Jimmy Page sustained during rehearsals) seemed like a spur of the moment thing -- but how spontaneous could it have been if it just happened to coincide with the release of an expanded The Song Remains the Same on both CD and DVD, the debut of their catalog as digital downloads, and the new two-disc compilation Mothership as a sampler of the whole shebang? Considering this full-scale, multi-prong assault -- which also included a new album by Robert Plant, after all -- it was probably not all that spontaneous. Such a precise attack suits this most mythic of classic rock groups, who always benefited from an enormous sense of scale. Weighing in at two discs and 24 tracks, Mothership has a sense of scale that the previous round of compilations -- the two-part Early Days & Latter Days, delivered in 1999 and 2000 respectively -- lacked, not just because it pushes these two phases together but because it is heavy on the heavy epics, emphasizing Zeppelin's sheer sonic ballast over either their lighter or more idiosyncratic moments. This effects the second disc more than the first, as the band started out heavy and expanded outward, and while it would have been nice if ~Fool in the Rain~ represented In Through the Out Door instead of ~In the Evening,~ this is a minor quibble as Mothership hits the obvious high points without seeming perfunctory. And that, along with Page's new remastering, is the real selling point behind Mothership: as a compilation it is both gripping listening and a good introduction to this very album-oriented band, which is what makes it a welcome addition to their catalog. [The deluxe edition of Mothership contains a DVD with highlights from their eponymous live DVD -- it's a nice bonus but really, you'd be better off getting the full set.]</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

He played piano on Lauryn Hill's ~Everything Is Everything~ and might as well be considered Kanye West's sidekick, having assisted the producer and MC on several sessions — Jay-Z's ~Encore~ and Slum Village's ~Selfish~ being two of the more prominent 2004 singles featuring his work. A former choir director, he has also released a handful of energetic live discs, some of which are credited to his less hubristic birth name, John Stephens. And though he claims ~I've got something new,~ you've also heard substantial chunks of Get Lifted in records made decades ago by Sly & the Family Stone, Curtis Mayfield, Quincy Jones, and Bill Withers. This might not be a problem for listeners who crave anything that recalls the music they first heard in their youth, but Legend's over-reliance upon his inspirations is an impediment as much as a slick way to grab attention. That's because he has more than enough talent and charm to get by on his own. His own lyrics and hooks are unique and clever enough to get the point across that he's no everyday R&B artist and, just as importantly, he has a personable and instantly fetching voice you could listen to all day long. However, the association with West — whose Sony-distributed boutique label released the record — is very helpful. Without it, Legend would likely be zoned into neo-soul (2003's Live at SOB's New York City really makes this notion apparent), thereby standing little chance of reaching the ears of anyone younger than 30. The production work supporting his songs strikes a fine balance between soul and hip-hop, allowing him to appeal to those who are coming from either angle. This is a very good record. It's a given that Legend is destined to make at least two others that top it. [Columbia released an edition with a bonus DVD.]</p><p>&mdash; <b>Andy Kellman</b></p>"

When this recording was made in 2001, Li was a mere 19 years old, but from the evidence on this disc, he was already a formidable technician. The extravagant technical difficulties of the repertoire — Chopin's Sonata No. 3, several of the etudes, and the Andante spianato et grande polonaise — are dispatched with skill and panache from the most delicate arabesques to the thunderous double octaves in contrary motion. Although there have been many other pianists who have played these works as well or better from a technical point of view, Li's performances stand up well in their company. But for all of his maturity as a technician, Li's interpretations are still those of a youth. The deeper meaning of the Sonata No. 3 — its awe-inspiring harmonic structure and its formalization of fear and courage in the opening and closing movements — are wholly beyond Li. The transcendentelegance of the Andante spianato and the radiant joy of the grande polonaise are merely graceful and cheerful in Li's interpretations. And his three Nocturnes are not so much emotional, seductive, and beautiful as they are sentimental, playful, and pretty. With his amazing technique, Li may develop into an amazing pianist. But one hopes that he grows as an interpreter as well.</p> &mdash; <b>by James Leonard - All Music</b>"

		"firstname": "Gordon",
		"lastname": "Lightfoot",
		"name": "Gordon Lightfoot",
		"biography": "<p>One of the leading singer/songwriters of the 1960s and '70s, Gordon Lightfoot was Canada's most successful contemporary folk artist, establishing himself as an important songwriter in the mid-'60s and going on to become a major international recording star in the following decade. Lightfoot's songs are literate but down to earth, and deal with personal matters as well as global issues in a manner that's poetic yet accessible, and his rich, strong voice is a superb vehicle for his material, though his songs are versatile enough that many artists have enjoyed success with his tunes.</p><p>Lightfoot was born in Orilla, Ontario on November 17, 1938. His mother had an interest in music and recognized her son's talent at an early age; he was singing in church at the age of five, and came in second in a local talent competition when he was ten. At 12, Lightfoot began studying piano and voice, learning the rudiments of both pop and classical styles, and after winning a Toronto Kiwanis Festival music contest in 1951, he performed as part of a special concert at Toronto's Massey Hall (widely regarded as Canada's equivalent to New York's Carnegie Hall in terms of prestige). After Lightfoot's voice changed, he taught himself to play guitar and began performing with a folk group called the Teen Timers, and also took up drumming and singing with a barbershop quartet. After graduating from high school, he moved to California to study orchestration and jazz composition at the Westlake College of Music. While Lightfoot found work singing on demo recordings and commercial jingles in Hollywood, he didn't care for life in California, and returned to Toronto to focus his efforts on folk and country music. In 1960, he became a member of the Swinging Eight, the in-house vocal group on the popular Canadian television series Country Hoedown, a position he held for two years, and formed a duo with fellow singer Terry Whalen called the Two Tones. While the Two Tones were popular enough to play at Canada's celebrated Mariposa Folk Festival and release an album in 1962, the duo was short-lived, and Lightfoot gave Europe a try in 1963, spending some time in Great Britain and hosting an eight week BBC-TV series, The Country & Western Show. By this time, Lightfoot had begun playing occasional solo dates, and had a regional hit in Canada with the single ~Remember Me (I'm the One),~ a moody pop ballad.</p><p>In 1963, Lightfoot discovered the work of Bob Dylan and began approaching his songwriting in a new and more personal style. Ian & Sylvia Tyson, the popular Canadian folk duo, heard Lightfoot performing some of his new material at a club in Toronto, and were impressed enough that they added some of his songs to their repertoire. Ian & Sylvia also brought Lightfoot's songs to the attention of their manager, Albert Grossman, who signed Lightfoot to a management contract. A number of major artists began recording Lightfoot's material, most notably Peter, Paul & Mary (who enjoyed hits with ~Early Morning Rain~ and ~For Lovin' Me~) and Marty Robbins (he topped the country charts with ~Ribbon of Darkness~). In 1966, Lightfoot signed a recording contract with United Artists Records, and his first solo album, simply called Lightfoot!, earned favorable reviews and was a modest commercial success. Between 1967 and 1969, Lightfoot would record three more studio albums and a live LP for United Artists, and he became a major star in his native Canada, where his albums often spun off hit singles, and he began headlining annually at Massey Hall to sold-out crowds. But in the United States, his songs were best known in recordings by others.</p><p>In 1970, after Lightfoot's contract with United Artists ran out, he broke ties with Grossman and signed a new record deal with the Reprise label. Lightfoot's first album for Reprise, Sit Down Young Stranger, boasted a more polished and sophisticated production than his UA material, and it spawned a long-overdue U.S. hit, ~If You Could Read My Mind.~ The single rose to the Top Five of the pop charts, and after the album was retitled If You Could Read My Mind, it reached the Top Ten. While Lightfoot had finally achieved international success, he continued to live and base his operations in Canada, and his next album, 1971's Summer Side of Life, featured several tunes focused on life in his homeland. In 1972, Lightfoot released two albums, Don Quixote and Old Dan's Records, but he was forced to cut back on his touring commitments after he was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy. In 1974, he returned with the album Sundown, which included the title tune and ~Carefree Highway,~ both of which became major hit singles, and his next two albums would also feature pop hits -- Summertime Dream included the modern-day folk narrative ~The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,~ and Cold on the Shoulder included ~Rainy Day People.~ Lightfoot's United Artists material had been reissued on a regular basis since ~If You Could Read My Mind~ became a hit, but he'd become disenchanted with the production and performances on his early albums, and the 1975 collection Gord's Gold featured new recordings of ten songs from his days at UA as well as 12 more recent hits. From 1978 onward, Lightfoot's presence on the singles charts began to fade, and while he continued to record and tour regularly, his stardom in the United States declined, though his annual run of shows at Massey Hall confirmed he still had a large and loyal audience at home. Lightfoot also began devoting more time to benefit shows for various charitable concerns, including world hunger and the environment, and he dabbled in acting, starring in the 1982 films Harry Tracy and Desperado, and playing a country singer on the short-lived American television series Hotel in 1988. In 1986, he was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.</p><p>Lightfoot began experiencing a creative revival in the '90s, recording two of his best-reviewed albums in decades, 1993's Waiting for You and 1998's A Painter Passing Through, but his career nearly came to a halt in early 2002 when he suffered an abdominal aortic aneurysm; he was in a coma for six weeks, and had a three-month stay in the hospital. He survived the illness, and in 2003, he was named a Companion of the Order of Canada, the highest honor the nation bestows on civilians. Early 2004 saw the release of Harmony, an album Lightfoot began working on before he fell ill; by the end of the year, he was back on the road. Lightfoot experienced another health scare in the fall of 2006, when he suffered a minor stroke that cost him some mobility in his right hand, but within six months he was able to play guitar again, and continued to perform on a regular basis. In February 2010, word spread on the Internet that Lightfoot had died, and many Canadian news organizations picked up the story. However, the singer himself happened to hear a news report about it while driving home from a dental appointment, and displaying an admirable sense of humor, contacted a Winnipeg radio station to confirm he was still alive despite reports to the contrary. In 2012, Lightfoot released All Live, a collection of recordings from his many appearances at Massey Hall; it was only his second live album in a career lasting over 40 years.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>",

Featuring both acoustic and folk-rock recordings, this neatly bundles Lightfoot's early work into a listenable and fairly inexpensive package.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

Accompanied by Red Shea on lead guitar and Rick Haynes on bass, he also mixed old favorites like ~I'm Not Sayin'~ and ~Canadian Railroad Trilogy~ with the new material on this set, which has good (though not outstanding) sound. These then-new songs aren't among his classics, but are up to the general high standard of his '60s work, with the socially conscious ~The Lost Children~ and the poetic ~Leaves of Grass~ standing out as lyrical highlights.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

Propelled by his second biggest hit, ~The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,~ Summertime Dream summed up the sound that had served Lightfoot so well in his post-~If You Could Read My Mind~ days. This distinctive sound featured Lightfoot's strummed six- or 12-string guitar complemented by Terry Clements' electric guitar lines and Pee Wee Charles' pedal steel guitar accents. The material here is excellent, and the singer's voice is at its strongest. Mixing upbeat songs like ~Race Among the Ruins,~ ~I'd Do It Again,~ and the title track with beautiful ballads such as ~I'm Not Supposed to Care~ and ~Spanish Moss,~ Lightfoot and his band deliver a tasty smorgasbord of intelligent, grown-up music. As for ~Edmund Fitzgerald,~ its continued popularity more than 20 years after its release attests to the power of a well-told tale and a tasty guitar lick.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jim Newsom</strong></p>"

On both volumes of Gord's Gold, he re-recorded early songs and mixed them with current hits -- which meant that a new ~Canadian Railroad Trilogy~ sat next to the hits like ~Sundown,~ but on Gord's Gold, Vol. 2, newer songs (which weren't quite hits) were next to re-recorded versions of staples like ~The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.~ This, needless to say, was a bit of an irritant, but this is well-executed enough to make up for the years of awkward compilations by covering everything from his UA recordings to his latter-day recordings for Warner in the mid-'80s. Some might say there should be a little bit more of the earlier songs, but, for most listeners, this will contain all the major items and is as close to definitive as possible to get.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"lastname": "Little Feat",
		"name": "Little Feat",
		"biography": "<p>Though they had all the trappings of a Southern-fried blues band, Little Feat were hardly conventional. Led by songwriter/guitarist Lowell George, Little Feat was a wildly eclectic band, bringing together strains of blues, R&B, country, and rock & roll. The bandmembers were exceptionally gifted technically and their polished professionalism sat well with the slick sounds coming out of southern California during the '70s. However, Little Feat were hardly slick -- they had a surreal sensibility, as evidenced by George's idiosyncratic songwriting, which helped the band earn a cult following among critics and musicians. Though the band earned some success on album-oriented radio, the group was derailed after George's death in 1979. Little Feat re-formed in the late '80s, and while they were playing as well as ever, they lacked the skewed sensibility that made them cult favorites. Nevertheless, their albums and tours were successful, especially among American blues-rock fans.</p><p>However, Little Feat wasn't conceived as a straight-ahead blues-rock group. Its founding members, Lowell George (vocals, guitar, slide guitar) and Roy Estrada (bass), were veterans of Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention. George had a long musical career before joining the Mothers. As a child, he and his brother Hampton performed a harmonica duet on television's Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour. During high school, he learned how to play flute, which led to him appearing as an oboist and baritone saxophonist on several Frank Sinatra recording sessions. He formed the folk-rock group the Factory with drummer Richard Hayward in 1965. Before disbanding, the Factory made some recordings for Uni Records, but the tapes sat unreleased until the 1990s. Following the group's demise, George joined the Mothers of Invention, where he met Estrada. Zappa convinced George to form his own band after hearing ~Willin',~ but the guitarist was reluctant to begin a band until he participated in a brief Standells reunion.</p><p>George and Estrada formed Little Feat in 1969 with Hayward and keyboardist Billy Payne. Neither its eponymous first album in 1971 nor 1972's <i>Sailin' Shoes</i> were commercial successes, despite strong reviews. As a result, the group temporarily disbanded, with Estrada leaving music to become a computer programmer. When the group reconvened later in 1972, he was replaced by New Orleans musician Kenny Gradney. In its second incarnation, Little Feat also featured guitarist Paul Barrére and percussionist Sam Clayton, who gave the music a funkier feeling, as demonstrated by 1973's <i>Dixie Chicken</i>. The band toured heavily behind the record, building a strong following in the South and on the East Coast. Nevertheless, the group remained centered in Los Angeles, since the members did a lot of session work on the side.</p><p>Though the band was earning a cult following, several members of the group were growing frustrated by George's erratic behavior and increasing drug use. Following 1974's <i>Feats Don't Fail Me Now</i>, Barrére and Payne became the band's primary songwriters and they were primarily responsible for the jazzy fusions of 1975's <i>The Last Record Album</i>. Little Feat continued in that direction on <i>Time Loves a Hero</i> (1977), the double-live album <i>Waiting for Columbus</i> (1978), and Down on the Farm (1979). Frustrated with the band's increasingly improvisational and jazzy nature, George recorded a solo album, <i>Thanks I'll Eat It Here</i>, which was released in 1979. Following its release, George announced that Little Feat had broken up, and he embarked on a solo tour. Partway through the tour, he died of an apparent heart attack. Down on the Farm was released after his death, as was the rarities collection <i>Hoy-Hoy!</i> (1981).</p><p>After spending seven years as sidemen, Payne, Barrére, Hayward, Gradney, and Clayton re-formed Little Feat in 1988, adding vocalist/guitarist Craig Fuller and guitarist Fred Tackett. The heavily anticipated Let It Roll was released in 1988 to mixed reviews, but it went gold. Each of the group's subsequent reunion albums -- Representing the Mambo (1989), Shake Me Up (1991), and Ain't Had Enough Fun (1995) -- sold progressively less, but the band remained a popular concert attraction. On the latter album, the band traded the strongly Lowell George-esque voice of Fuller for female singer Shaun Murphy; this lineup went on to release Under the Radar in 1998 and Chinese Work Songs in 2000.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>",

Being a sucker for anything that involves Lowell, his voice, his songs or his gorgeous slide guitar, I can’t ever get enough of these but if you only want one, then this is very much the one to get.</p><p>Even if you know nothing of this 1974 recording, there are some clear reasons for recommending this as being the first among equals. For starters, it was captured at the time the band were at their unarguable peak and that it has an excellent sound quality featuring many of the band’s best known and best-loved numbers. Then there is the notoriety and mythology of this session -  prior to this CD (the first legitimate incarnation of its existence), this has long featured among the most revered and sought-after bootlegs in rock history. This status is no doubt enhanced by the unverified rumours that Lowell himself was involved in the mixing and production work. This possibility is not even referenced in the notes and promotions that come with this CD so there may indeed be no truth in it. But still...</p><p>Whatever the truth (if any) of Lowell’s involvement, it is a fabulous document and maybe truest representation of the band live at their peak. From the sumptuous double-whammy of the openers, Rock ’N Roll Doctor and Two Trains, right through to the closing holy trinity of Cold, Cold, Cold, Dixie Chicken and Tripe Face Boogie, the band are smoking, rocking and irresistibly funky throughout, a combination they pull off better than most any other band on the planet, before or since. In between these, there is perhaps the best ever live version of Lowell’s masterpiece, Willin’, plus a near-definitive version of Alan Toussaint’s On Your Way Down, where they offer a barely-needed reminder that while (mostly) a band raised in California, they invoked the spirit of New Orleans better than most.</p><p>With other classics given a real party-time feel, this CD is a very welcome addition to the legitimate history of a much loved and respected band. A must for fans and a great place to start for the curious.</p>"

Pianist Bobo Stenson has carved his own identity out of the styles of Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett, drummer Billy Hart is stimulating in support and Anders Jormin provides a walking bass on many of the tracks; a rarity for ECM sessions. As one might expect, the main focus is on Charles Lloyd whose playing during the past decade has been some of the finest of his career. He mostly sticks to tenor (just playing flute on ~Little Peace~ and Chinese oboe on the very brief ~Milarepa~), and although traces of John Coltrane's sound will always be in his tone, Lloyd comes up with quite a few original ideas. He is best on ~Thelonious Theonlyus~ (which has a slight calypso feel to it), the episodic ~Cape to Cairo Suite~ (a tribute to Nelson Mandela), a long tenor/drums duet on ~All My Relations~ (which is a mix between ~Chasin' the 'Trane~ and ~Bessie's Blues~) and the brooding spiritual ~Hymne to the Mother.~ A strong effort.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b></p>"

		"name": "The Loved Ones",
		"biography": "<p>Of all the Australian rock groups of the '60s, there's none that lives on as brightly in the memories of those who saw them or heard them as the Loved Ones. They had ~it,~ that unquantifiable quality that transcends the fashions of the day, that ~something~ that's more than a great record or two, or frequent memorable live performances that grow larger than reality in people's memories. You can still hear ~it~ in some of their earliest records, still see ~it~ on the little video evidence left behind. The Loved Ones were exciting.</p><p>When the British group quake hit in the globe in the mid-'60s, most of the new bands inspired to start up started from scratch, made up of musicians who had only just picked up their instruments, more driven by their ambition to do it than their ability to do it. That's where the Loved Ones, like England's Animals or America's Paul Butterfield Blues Band, were different and unique. These were experienced musicians. They came from that time space between '50s rock and '60s rock when youth descended into jazz clubs, listenened to the blues, and watched it spawn folk music. They were already seasoned musicians. When the Rolling Stones came out of the London jazz scene playing their version of the blues, the Melbourne musicians who became the Loved Ones understood not just its excitement value, but how it was done.</p><p>The Loved Ones were formed in 1965 by three members of the Red Onions Jazz Band (Gerry Humphries, Ian Clyne, and Kim Lynch) and two members of Wild Cherries (Rob Lovett and Gavin Anderson), a jazz group at that time which later also turned to rock. Singer Gerry Humphries seems to have been the instigator, already an agitator for change and adventure, ruffling feathers inside the Red Onions. A Red Onions session was turned into the first recording by the Loved Ones, a group named after Evelyn Waugh's dark comic book of the day. Their first single carried the same name.</p><p>Two things marked that landmark recording: the unique double rhythm, a complex musical achievement made accessible by a clever use of hand clapping, and Gerry Humphries' sometimes bluesy, sometimes soaring voice. ~The Loved One~ was like nothing anyone had ever heard before, from Australia or from anywhere else in the world. 15 years later, early in their career, INXS would record a faithful copy, and then, seven more years on, at the height of their powers, INXS recorded it AGAIN and still couldn't dare a dramatic overhaul.</p><p>The Loved Ones' own version had an immediate impact in Australia. Attracted by the song, audiences found an enigmatic singer with sunken cheeks and outstretched arms as exciting as any singer they'd ever seen or heard before, surrounded by an obviously more than competent band of not just pretty faces, but pretty enough to attract fans of their own. They followed ~The Loved One~ with ~Ever Loving Man,~ showing off Humphries' voice more than the first single, and another interesting but less complicated arrangement. Third came the compelling ~Sad Dark Eyes.~ As the band careened headlong into the pop stardom tunnel they had never imagined for themselves, their keyboard player did an ~Eric Clapton~ and jumped off. With him left part of the band's songwriting power.</p><p>The Loved Ones' records were released by an independent record company which had made its name as a boutique label recording cover versions of American hits by local Melbourne performers and made a significant contribution recording Melbourne jazz and folk — hence the Red Onions Jazz Band connection. What W&G Records wasn't ready for, and had never had to deal with before, was a national pop hit... and then a second... and a third. By the time hometown Melbourne was ready for a second hit, the first was only taking off in another part of Australia; and when the third was released, a different area finally had enough stock of the first. The band was sent whirling around the country chasing their hits. In the middle of it all they quickly ducked into the studio and recorded a jazz standard they could play with their eyes closed. The ~Blueberry Hill~ EP was a hit too. It took a year before the band was able to return to the studio properly to complete enough songs for an album. By then another original member had left, replaced by an American. The dynamics of the band had completely changed. An album, Magic Box, was hobbled around the singles. But the Loved Ones were exhausted and spent and broke up in October 1967, just two years after they were formed with so much promise.</p><p>Singer Gerry Humphries rattled around the music scene, tried management, formed the anything-goes fun-and-nonsense Jerry and the Joy Boys, and in 1977, returned to London in an unsuccessful attempt to save a failing marriage, giving up music for the life of a hospital orderly. One suspects there could have been so much more.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Ed Nimmervoll</b></p>",

In other words, it's not really representative, particularly in how it consciously avoids his status as a leader of the alt-country movement in the first Bush era. His Large Band, Joshua Judges Ruth, and I Love Everybody are entirely avoided (perhaps saved for Vol. 2), and even good portions of Lovett's country work are ignored, such as ~You're Not From Texas~ and the rest of The Road to Ensenada, for that matter. That's not really a complaint, but their absence feels more puzzling since two new songs are thrown in for good measure (the really good ~The Truck Song,~ plus ~San Antonio Girl~). In any regard, this is a good summary of Lovett's first two albums, containing most of the great songs from those records &mdash; ~God Will,~ ~This Old Porch,~ ~If I Were the Man You Wanted,~ ~If I Had a Boat,~ ~Walk Through the Bottomland,~ and ~LA County~ are as good as music got in the '80s, and it's a pleasure to hear them in any context. Even so, it's hard to shake the nagging feeling that the whole story isn't told with this collection, and it's even harder not to notice that Lovett hasn't released a collection of original songs since 1996 &mdash; and, for the hardcore fans who are suckered in by the two new songs, it'll be hard not to wish that a full-fledged album is around the corner sometime soon.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"name": "Taj Mahal",
		"biography": "<p>One of the most prominent figures in late 20th century blues, singer/multi-instrumentalist Taj Mahal played an enormous role in revitalizing and preserving traditional acoustic blues. Not content to stay within that realm, Mahal soon broadened his approach, taking a musicologist's interest in a multitude of folk and roots music from around the world -- reggae and other Caribbean folk, jazz, gospel, R&B, zydeco, various West African styles, Latin, even Hawaiian. The African-derived heritage of most of those forms allowed Mahal to explore his own ethnicity from a global perspective and to present the blues as part of a wider musical context. Yet while he dabbled in many different genres, he never strayed too far from his laid-back country blues foundation. Blues purists naturally didn't have much use for Mahal's music, and according to some of his other detractors, his multi-ethnic fusions sometimes came off as indulgent, or overly self-conscious and academic. Still, Mahal's concept was vindicated in the '90s, when a cadre of young bluesmen began to follow his lead -- both acoustic revivalists (Keb' Mo', Guy Davis) and eclectic bohemians (Corey Harris, Alvin Youngblood Hart).</p><p>Taj Mahal was born Henry St. Clair Fredericks in New York on May 17, 1942. His parents -- his father a jazz pianist/composer/arranger of Jamaican descent, his mother a schoolteacher from South Carolina who sang gospel -- moved to Springfield, Massachusetts, when he was quite young, and while growing up there, he often listened to music from around the world on his father's short-wave radio. He particularly loved the blues -- both acoustic and electric -- and early rock & rollers like Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. While studying agriculture and animal husbandry at the University of Massachusetts, he adopted the musical alias Taj Mahal (an idea that came to him in a dream) and formed Taj Mahal & the Elektras, who played around the area during the early '60s. After graduating, Mahal moved to Los Angeles in 1964 and, after making his name on the local folk-blues scene, formed the Rising Sons with guitarist Ry Cooder. The group signed to Columbia and released one single, but the label didn't quite know what to make of their forward-looking blend of Americana, which anticipated a number of roots rock fusions that would take shape in the next few years; as such, the album they recorded sat on the shelves, unreleased until 1992.</p><p>Frustrated, Mahal left the group and wound up staying with Columbia as a solo artist. His self-titled debut was released in early 1968 and its stripped-down approach to vintage blues sounds made it unlike virtually anything else on the blues scene at the time. It came to be regarded as a classic of the '60s blues revival, as did its follow-up, Natch'l Blues. The half-electric, half-acoustic double-LP set Giant Step followed in 1969, and taken together, those three records built Mahal's reputation as an authentic yet unique modern-day bluesman, gaining wide exposure and leading to collaborations or tours with a wide variety of prominent rockers and bluesmen. During the early '70s, Mahal's musical adventurousness began to take hold; 1971's Happy Just to Be Like I Am heralded his fascination with Caribbean rhythms, and the following year's double-live set, The Real Thing, added a New Orleans-flavored tuba section to several tunes. In 1973, Mahal branched out into movie soundtrack work with his compositions for Sounder, and the following year he recorded his most reggae-heavy outing, Mo' Roots.</p><p>Mahal continued to record for Columbia through 1976, when he switched to Warner Bros.; he recorded three albums for that label, all in 1977 (including a soundtrack for the film Brothers). Changing musical climates, however, were decreasing interest in Mahal's work and he spent much of the '80s off record, eventually moving to Hawaii to immerse himself in another musical tradition. Mahal returned in 1987 with Taj, an album issued by Gramavision that explored this new interest; the following year, he inaugurated a string of successful, well-received children's albums with Shake Sugaree. The next few years brought a variety of side projects, including a musical score for the lost Langston Hughes/Zora Neale Hurston play Mule Bone that earned Mahal a Grammy nomination in 1991.</p><p>The same year marked Mahal's full-fledged return to regular recording and touring, kicked off with the first of a series of well-received albums on the Private Music label, Like Never Before. Follow-ups, such as Dancing the Blues (1993) and Phantom Blues (1996), drifted into more rock, pop, and R&B-flavored territory; in 1997, Mahal won a Grammy for Señor Blues. Meanwhile, he undertook a number of small-label side projects that constituted some of his most ambitious forays into world music. Released in 1995, Mumtaz Mahal teamed him with classical Indian musicians; 1998's Sacred Island was recorded with his new Hula Blues Band as he explored Hawaiian music in greater depth, and 1999's Kulanjan was a duo performance with Malian kora player Toumani Diabaté. Maestro appeared in 2008, boasting an array of all-star guests: Diabaté, Angélique Kidjo, Ziggy Marley, Los Lobos, Jack Johnson, and Ben Harper. A holiday album with the Blind Boys of Alabama, Talkin' Christmas, appeared in time for the season in 2014. In 2017, Mahal teamed with Keb' Mo' to spotlight the good-time side of the blues on TajMo.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Steve Huey</strong></p>",

The electric Giant Step (1968) was released alongside the acoustic and decidedly rural De Ole Folks at Home (1968). The nine cuts on Giant Step feature support from the instrumental trio of Jessie Ed Davis (guitar/keyboards), Gary Gilmore (bass) and Chuck Blackwell (drums). They back Taj Mahal on a wide selection of covers ranging from Carole King and Gerry Goffin's ~Take a Giant Step~ to the upbeat and soulful reading of the Huddie Ledbetter blues staple ~Keep Your Hands off Her.~ The arrangements are unique and offer the artist's distinctive approach. Nowhere is this more evident than the practically jovial mid-tempo ~Good Morning Little Schoolgirl~ or the freewheeling abandon that is brought to the 18-wheeler anthem ~Six Days on the Road,~ recalling the version of ~Ain't That a Lot of Love~ from Taj Mahal's preceding effort Natch'l Blues (1968). Additionally, Blind Willie Johnson's ~You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond~ stands out with a strong and soaring gospel-flavoured score. Giant Step concludes with ~Bacon Fat,~ a number attributed here via Garth Hudson and Robbie Robertson of the Band. That said, it may be better-known from the man they called Mr. Rhythm, Andre Williams, whose scattered down-home spoken interludes punctuate his February 1957 Top 10 R&B hit -- which incidentally was created under the working title ~Diddle, Diddle Womp, Womp.~ Parties searching for an apt introduction when discovering Taj Mahal's voluminous catalogue are encouraged to consider Giant Step as a highly recommended reference point.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

Although it has much of the screaming rock energy and sometimes exaggerated competitive frenzy of its predecessor, Birds of Fire is audibly more varied in texture, even more tightly organized, and thankfully more musical in content. A remarkable example of precisely choreographed, high-speed solo trading -- with John McLaughlin, Jerry Goodman, and Jan Hammer all of one mind, supported by Billy Cobham's machine-gun drumming and Rick Laird's dancing bass -- can be heard on the aptly named ~One Word,~ and the title track is a defining moment of the group's nearly atonal fury. The band also takes time out for a brief bit of spaced-out electronic burbling and static called ~Sapphire Bullets of Pure Love.~ Yet the most enticing pieces of music on the record are the gorgeous, almost pastoral opening and closing sections to ~Open Country Joy,~ a relaxed, jocular bit of communal jamming that they ought to have pursued further. This album actually became a major crossover hit, rising to number 15 on the pop album charts, and it remains the key item in the first Mahavishnu Orchestra's slim discography.</p>&mdas; <b>Richard S.

He began to tour internationally with female singers the Mahotella Queens, although he has been playing and singing his brand of mbaqanga (Zulu pop music, heavily influenced by traditional singing styles) since the early '60s. Mahlathini started singing on street corners, graduated to men's choral music, and went on to form his own smaller group in the mid-'60s. When he ~went electric~ in the mid-'70s, his new sound caused a sensation, and much controversy. With the Mahotella Queens supplying their dynamic backing vocals and fancy dance routines (think of a South African version of the Supremes) and Mahlathini's primal groaning filling the air, you don't have to understand the language to get the message, although the group has occasionally recorded in English. Another part of Mahlathini's success is the backing supplied by West Nkosi and the Makgona Tsohle Band. ~Makgona Tsohle means 'Jack-of-all-trades',~ Nkosi once said. ~Our mbaqanga is a blend of traditional styles with modern instruments, a music anyone can relate to.~ The group delivered its last live performance in 1997; the following year Nkosi was killed in an auto accident, and on June 29, 1999, Mahlathini passed on following a long illness.</p>&mdash; <b>J.

		"biography": "<p>Led by Stephen Stills, with Chris Hillman (the Byrds, Flying Burrito Brothers), Paul Harris (session musician for B.B. King, Eric Anderson, and many others), Joe Lala (Blues Image), Al Perkins (Flying Burrito Brothers), Calvin ~Fuzzy~ Samuels (Crosby, Stills, & Nash), and Dallas Taylor (Crosby, Stills, & Nash), Manassas was one of the most talented units in music at the time. Equally at home with Latin jams, rock, blues, country, folk, and bluegrass, they were also one of the most versatile outfits in rock history.</p><p>Formed in 1971 from the sessions for what was going to be Stills' third solo album, the chemistry of the musicians he gathered was so intense that before long they were a full-fledged band. With an album completed (at hotspot Criteria Studios in Miami), the group was still without a name. Yet despite this they embarked on a small tour. At a train station in Manassas, VA, a picture of the group standing under a Manassas sign was taken, giving birth to their name and, conveniently, the album cover.</p><p>Equally at home on-stage as in the studio, the band's shows often stretched to three hours, usually in the format of an opening rock set, a solo Stills acoustic set, Hillman and Perkins playing bluegrass, another rock and country set by the band, and a closing acoustic set. Manassas' tours took them all over the world and, while in Paris in March 1972, Stills met French singer/songwriter Veronique Sanson. In the next year they would be married, with a son, Chris, born not long after (later to be a recording artist in his own right). Stills and Lala (along with later Manassas member Kenny Passarelli) would also play on her 1974 release Le Maudit.</p><p>In addition to their hectic touring schedule, studio time was logged, producing another album of songs. Unfortunately, though, the results were not as inspired as their self-titled debut. Drinking and drugs were negatively affecting the quality of their music, and much of the material recorded was unused (including a track with Stevie Wonder on lead vocals). Recording where the first album had been done at Criteria Studios, producer/engineers Ron Albert and Howard Albert eventually quit the project in frustration with the band; it was completed in Colorado and Los Angeles. In the end, Down the Road wasn't a bad album, it just didn't quite stack up to its predecessor.</p><p>Another contributing factor to the demise of the group was the ever-present shadow of Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young. Atlantic Records didn't promote the Manassas albums sufficiently, viewing the band as more of a side project to Stills' involvement in CSN&Y. In 1973, in fact, CSN&Y reunited in Hawaii to put together a new album, which eventually fizzled. Stills returned to Colorado with the intent to pick up where he left off with Manassas, yet it was a little too late to put the pieces back together. Taylor was now addicted to heroin and Samuels had other commitments, making him unavailable. Not dissuaded, Stills filled the vacant slot with Kenny Passarelli, bass player with Joe Walsh's Barnstorm, on the short tour the two groups did together. The series of shows was the swan song for Manassas, as each member left to pursue different projects at tour's end. Hillman became part of the Souther-Hillman-Furay Band, while Stills was soon on the road as a solo artist with a touring band featuring Donnie Dacus of Veronique Sanson's band, veteran Russ Kunkel, and keyboardist Jerry Aiello, and would record a solo album soon after.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Rob Caldwell</strong></p>",

		"biography": "<p>An R&B band that only played pop to get on the charts, Manfred Mann and its various permutations ranked among the most adept British Invasion acts in both styles. South African-born keyboardist Manfred Mann was originally an aspiring jazz player, moving toward R&B when more blues-oriented sounds became in vogue in England in the early '60s. Original Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones was one of the best British Invasion singers, and his resonant vocals were the best feature of their early R&B sides, which had a slightly jazzier and smoother touch than the early work of the Rolling Stones and Animals.</p><p>It was a couple covers of obscure girl group songs, ~Do Wah Diddy Diddy~ (the Exciters) and ~Sha La La~ (the Shirelles), that broke the group internationally -- ~Do Wah Diddy Diddy~ reached number one in the States, and ~Sha La La~ just missed the Top Ten. The Paul Jones lineup never duplicated this success, although ~Come Tomorrow~ and ~Pretty Flamingo~ were smaller hits. From 1964 to 1966, they took the approach of playing gutsy pop/rock on their singles (including the original version of ~My Little Red Book~) and soul and R&B on their albums, with occasional detours into jazz, Dylan (their cover of his then-unreleased ~If You Gotta Go, Go Now~ was a big British hit), and competent original material.</p><p>Jones left for a solo career and acting in 1966, and the group reformed around singer Mike D'Abo (Beatle friend Klaus Voormann was also in this aggregation on bass). Adopting an even more pop-oriented approach for the singles, with occasional psychedelic and progressive touches, the band ran off a string of Top Ten hits in their homeland until 1969, although the only one to hit the jackpot in the U.S. was their cover of another unreleased Dylan song, ~The Mighty Quinn.~</p><p>Mann dissolved the D'Abo lineup in 1969 to form Manfred Mann Chapter Three with drummer Mike Hugg, who had been in the band since the beginning. The outfit's early jazz-rock efforts were interesting, but not very popular, and Manfred steered the ship back toward mainstream rock by forming yet another incarnation, Manfred Mann's Earth Band. The heavier, more synthesizer-oriented outfit made quite a few albums in the 1970s; 1976's The Roaring Silence made the Top Ten, and featured the number one hit ~Blinded by the Light~ (Mann also made the Top 40 with another Springsteen cover, ~Spirit in the Night~). Ironically, despite Mann's oft-proclaimed preferences for serious explorations of jazz, blues, and progressive music, it's his pop/rock recordings that hold up best, and for which he'll be remembered most.</p>",

		"biography": "<p>The oldest of the four musical Marsalis brothers, Branford Marsalis has had an impressive career. After studying at Southern University and Berklee, Branford toured Europe with the Art Blakey big band in the summer of 1980 (playing baritone), played three months with Clark Terry, and then spent five months playing alto with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers (1981). He mostly played tenor and soprano while with Wynton Marsalis' influential group (1982-1985), at first sounding most influenced by Wayne Shorter but leaning more toward John Coltrane at the end. The musical telepathy between the two brothers (who helped to revive the sound of the mid-'60s Miles Davis Quintet) was sometimes astounding. Branford toured with Herbie Hancock's V.S.O.P. II. in 1983 and recorded with Miles Davis (1984's Decoy). In 1985, when he left Wynton to join Sting's pop/rock group, it caused a major (if temporary) rift with his brother that made headlines. Marsalis enjoyed playing with Sting but did not let the association cause him to forget his musical priorities. By 1986, he was leading his own group which eventually consisted of pianist Kenny Kirkland, bassist Bob Hurst, and drummer Jeff ~Tain~ Watts; sometimes the band was a piano-less trio that really allowed Marsalis to stretch out. After a couple of film appearances (in School Daze and Throw Mama From the Train), Branford Marsalis became even more of a celebrity when he joined Jay Leno's Tonight Show as the musical director in 1992. However, being cast in the role of Leno's sidekick rubbed against Marsalis' temperament and after two years he had had enough. Branford Marsalis, who attempted to mix together hip-hop and jazz in his erratic Buckshot LeFonque project, has recorded steadily for Columbia ever since 1983 (including a classical set).</p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b>",

Branford Marsalis, usually known for his jazz background, asserts his mastery of the soprano saxophone on this excellent collection of romantic chamber music. Accompanied by the English Chamber Orchestra, Marsalis indulges us with some of his most fervent music yet. Each piece explores a different aspect of love and romance. Vocalese, originally for the soprano voice, portray the vocal lyricism and musicality of Marsalis' soprano saxophone. The ~Rachmaninoff Vocalese~ is an exceptional confirmation of the mastery of tone and musicianship that defines the music Marsalis is known for. Other well-known works, such as Debussy's L'Isle Joyeuse and Stravinsky's Pastorale, brilliantly contrast the air that Marsalis has played since 1981. The French and Russian compositions add a new dimension to the young Marsalis repertoire — classical romantic.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Paula Edelstein</b></p>"

If there are any serious flaws in the playing, they will escape the vast majority of ears out there, for this is an uncompromising, well-played disc of acoustic jazz that leans a bit toward adventure at times. At first, Branford's foursome (Kirkland, Eric Revis on bass, and Jeff ~Tain~ Watts on drums) seems content to turn out a pretty good facsimile of the John Coltrane Quartet, with Kirkland playing brilliantly and reflectively in the McCoy Tyner manner. But with ~Lykief~ — a pun on Keith Jarrett's name — Branford takes up Jarrett's long unanswered challenge and pushes through a tumbling, nearly rhythmically free piece attractively anchored by Jarrett's gospel harmonies and melodic methods. ~Bullworth~ blasts off on a Watts hip-hop rhythm, with Branford going nuts in an angular bit of soloing, and ~16th St. Baptist Church~ apparently sends the CD home on a funky New Orleans street march, only to be followed by a touching, uncredited Marsalis/Kirkland benediction. Once again, the post-Tonight Show, post-Buckshot Marsalis makes a credibly serious jazz statement in what turned out to be the swan song for one of the neo-bop era's finest lineups.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Richard S.

While no one can entirely recreate the famed chemistry that existed between Kirkland and Marsalis, pianist Joey Calderazzo does a marvelous job handling the extraordinary complexity, energy, and beauty of Marsalis's music. Bassist Eric Revis and drummer Jeff ~Tain~ Watts, both of whom played on 1999's Requiem (which wound up being the last recording of Kirkland's life), carry on here in the spirit of their departed friend, fleshing out Marsalis's increasingly challenging ensemble concepts and -- most importantly -- swinging like men possessed.~In the Crease~ and ~Tain Mutiny,~ with their unpredictable twists and turns, are indicative of the gravitas of Marsalis's work ever since he left his post at The Tonight Show. But the album's high point is a lengthy take of ~Elysium,~ a tune that appeared on Requiem as a trio piece, an aesthetic choice necessitated by the sudden death of Kirkland who never had a chance to play on the track. Here the full quartet weighs in, deftly executing a dizzying series of tempo shifts and subtle cues, all seamlessly worked into a fabric of extended, burning improvisation. Finally, ~Sleepy Hollow,~ a slow blues tucked away at the end of the program as a hidden track, sounds as though the band just let the tape roll as they warmed down from the session. It's a delightfully unrehearsed moment, perhaps a closing homage to Kirkland, drawn from deep down in the tradition.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>David R. Adler</strong></p>"

Beginning with his first session as a leader on 1983's Scenes in the City through to 1999's Requiem — his second to last album for the label — the eldest of the Marsalis brothers carved a singular path through the jazz world. Inspired by such innovative luminaries as John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, and Wayne Shorter, Marsalis always displayed a deep understanding of his jazz roots while also looking to put his own unique stamp on the music. Never as buttoned-up as his trumpet-playing brother, the saxophonist made recordings that often seemed brilliantly haphazard, allowing for humorous and idiosyncratic forays into gutbucket blues and torrents of avant-garde skronk. His almost psychic connection with his bandmates, including the late pianist Kenny Kirkland, drummer Jeff ~Tain~ Watts, and bassist Robert Hurst, made for exciting and sometimes irreverent music that often gave the impression of eavesdropping on a conversation ripe with inside jokes. Most of the tracks here are original compositions by Marsalis, and many showcase his early ~burnout~ aesthetic of pushing his solos to the furthest limit he could. Others, such as ~Royal Garden Blues~ and ~Sidney in da Haus,~ find the versatile New Orleans native rejoicing in his hometown second-line traditions with a bluesy, modernist edge. Marsalis left Columbia in 2002 to start his own independent music label; The Steep Anthology is a fitting tribute to the development of one of the most influential and individualistic jazz musicians of his generation.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Matt Collar</b></p>"

		"firstname": "John",
		"lastname": "Martyn",
		"name": "John Martyn",
		"biography": "<p>Scottish born singer-songwriter/guitarist John Martyn began his innovative and expansive career at the age of 17 with a style influenced by American blues artists such as Robert Johnson and Skip James, the traditional music of his homeland, and the eclectic folk of Davey Graham. With the aid of his mentor, traditional singer Hamish Imlach, Martyn began to make a name for himself and eventually moved to London, where he became a fixture at Cousins, the center for the local folk scene that spawned the likes of Bert Jansch, Ralph McTell and Al Stewart. Soon after, he caught the attention of Island Records founder Chris Blackwell, who made him the first solo white act to join the roster of his reggae-based label. The subsequent album, London Conversation (Feb. 1968), only hinted at what was to come in Martyn's career. Although it contained touches of blues along with Martyn's rhythmic playing and distinctive voice, it was for the most part a fairly straightforward British folk record. With his follow-up later that same year, the Al Stewart-produced The Tumbler, Martyn began to slowly test other waters, employing backup musicians such as jazz reedman Harold McNair, to flesh out his sound. His voice also started to take on a jazzier quality as he began to experiment musically.</p><p>While on the road, Martyn continued to experiment with his sound, adding various effects to his electrified acoustic. One such effect, the Echoplex, allowed him to play off of tape loops of his own guitar, enveloping himself in his own playing while continuing to play leads over the swelling sound. This would become an integral part of his recordings and stage performances in the coming years. He also met Beverley Kutner, a singer from Coventry who later became his wife and musical partner. The duo released two records in 1970, Stormbringer and The Road to Ruin, the former recorded in Woodstock, N.Y. with American musicians including members of the Band. For one track on their second album, John and Bev hired Pentangle double bassist Danny Thompson, who remained a constant in John's career through a better part of the '70s, on stage and in the studio. John planned his third solo album when Beverley retired to take care of the couple's children, although there was supposedly pressure from Island for him to record on his own.</p><p>The next couple of years saw Martyn continuing to expand on his unique blend of folk music, drawing on folk, blues, rock and jazz as well as music from the Middle East, South America and Jamaica. His voice continued to transform with each album while his playing became more aggressive, yet without losing its gentler side. Bless the Weather (1971) and <i>Solid Air</i> (1973) which helped form the foundation of Martyn's fan base, featured some of his most mature and enduring songs -- ~Solid Air,~ written for close friend Nick Drake, ~May You Never~ (recorded by Eric Clapton), and ~Head and Heart~ (recorded by America). By the time of 1973's Inside Out, Martyn's use of the Echoplex had taken on a life of its own, while his vocals became more of an instrument: deeper and bluesier, with words slithering into one another, barely decipherable.</p><p>During this period, Martyn's well-publicized bouts with alcoholism came to the forefront and began to affect his career somewhat. He became an erratic and at times self-destructive performer. He might perform an evening of electronic guitar experiments for a crowd of folkies or a set of traditional, acoustic ballads when playing to a rock audience. His shows would also range from the odd night of falling over drunk to sheer brilliance, as captured on the independently released Live at Leeds (1975).</p><p>Following Sunday's Child (1974), the live record and a 1977 best-of collection, Martyn, for the most part, abandoned his acoustic guitar on record for a sort of rock, world and jazz fusion. Although his style was moving away from its folk roots, his songs retained the passion and structure of his best early work. Grace and Danger (1980), his first release since 1977's <i>One World</i>, painfully and honestly depicted the crumbling of John and Beverley's marriage in some of his most powerful material in years. It also seemed to gather interest in Martyn's sagging career. With this new momentum and the help of friend Phil Collins, Martyn signed to WEA, where he recorded two records, Glorious Fool (1981) and Well Kept Secret (1982). Glorious Fool, a superb effort, produced by Collins and featuring Eric Clapton on guitar and Collins on drums, piano and vocals, looked to be his best shot at mainstream success, but failed to extend his cult status. Martyn released his second independent live record, the magnificent Philentropy, before returning to Island Records for two studio releases, a live album and a 12~ single which featured a version of Bob Dylan's ~Tight Connection to My Heart.~ He was dropped by the label in 1988.</p><p>Martyn, continuing to battle his alcoholism, resumed his career in 1990 with The Apprentice and 1992's Cooltide. He also released an album of his classic songs re-recorded with an all-star cast featuring Phil Collins, David Gilmour of Pink Floyd and Levon Helm of the Band, as well as various compilations and live recordings. After a four year layoff, Martyn issued And, an album with strong jazz, trip-hop and funk overtones, followed in 1998 by The Church with One Bell, a collection of diverse covers. In 1999 he also released a live double album which documented a classic concert at London's Shaw Theatre in 1990 entitled Dirty Down & Live.</p><p>Whether with his characteristic backslap acoustic guitar playing, his effects driven experimental journeys or catalog of excellent songs, John Martyn remains an important and influential figure in both British folk and rock.</p>&mdash; <b>Brett Hartenbach</b>",

				"review": "<p>John Martyn was Island Records' first white solo performer. Having debuted as a fresh-faced teenage folky with 1967's London Conversation, he soon embarked on a restless musical odyssey. Built on a foundation of folk, blues, and jazz, Martyn's music has ranged from effects-laden experimentation, through rock, to fusion-influenced pop. This overview of Martyn's Island recordings ignores his first two albums and two releases with then-wife Beverley, picking up with Bless the Weather (1971). Although ornate love songs from that record like ~Head and Heart~ remain close to Martyn's traditionalist roots, the instrumental ~Glistening Glyndebourne~ shows he was keen to distance himself from the Donovan-Cat Stevens orbit of twee folk-pop. Solid Air, 1973's sublime follow-up, is well represented here. On it, Martyn moved effortlessly among light acoustic tunes (~Over the Hill~), darker, jazzier numbers (~Solid Air,~ his ode to friend Nick Drake), and gizmo-enhanced excursions (his rendering of Skip James' ~I'd Rather Be the Devil~). Martyn pursued his experimental inclinations further with the jazz-folkadelic Inside Out (1973); that album's adventurous spirit is captured by the gently droning ~Eibhli Ghail Chiuin Ni Chearbhaill,~ which reworks a 19th century Celtic folk tune with such late 20th century rock tools as a fuzzbox and phase-shifter. Sunday's Child (1974) returned to a more focused song format, as demonstrated by the mournful ~Spencer the Rover.~ Martyn's next studio venture, One World (1977), combined chilled-out moodscapes (~Small Hours~) with slick, adult-oriented pop and rock (~Dancing~), the latter tendency even more prominent on Grace & Danger (1980) and exemplified by the delicate ~Sweet Little Mystery.~ While Martyn's later Island releases were less memorable, those mid-'80s numbers collected here hold up well. This album provides a great introduction to John Martyn; its only weakness is the omission of his earliest efforts, a sampling of which would give a fuller sense of his work's evolution.</p>&mdash; <b>Wilson Neate</b>"

		"lastname": "Mayall",
		"name": "John Mayall",
		"biography": "<P>The elder statesman of British blues, it is Mayall's lot to be more renowned as a bandleader and mentor than as a performer in his own right. Throughout the '60s, his band, the Bluesbreakers, acted as a finishing school for the leading British blues-rock musicians of the era. Guitarists Eric Clapton, Peter Green, and Mick Taylor joined his band in a remarkable succession in the mid-'60s, honing their chops with Mayall before going on to join Cream, Fleetwood Mac, and the Rolling Stones, respectively. John McVie and Mick Fleetwood, Jack Bruce, Aynsley Dunbar, Dick Heckstall-Smith, Andy Fraser (of Free), John Almond, and Jon Mark also played and recorded with Mayall for varying lengths of times in the '60s.</P><P>Mayall's personnel has tended to overshadow his own considerable abilities. Only an adequate singer, the multi-instrumentalist was adept in bringing out the best in his younger charges (Mayall himself was in his 30s by the time the Bluesbreakers began to make a name for themselves). Doing his best to provide a context in which they could play Chicago-style electric blues, Mayall was never complacent, writing most of his own material (which ranged from good to humdrum), revamping his lineup with unnerving regularity, and constantly experimenting within his basic blues format. Some of these experiments (with jazz-rock and an album on which he played all the instruments except drums) were forgettable; others, like his foray into acoustic music in the late '60s, were quite successful. Mayall's output has caught some flak from critics for paling next to the real African-American deal, but much of his vintage work -- if weeded out selectively -- is quite strong; especially his legendary 1966 LP with Eric Clapton, which both launched Clapton into stardom and kick-started the blues boom into full gear in England.</P><P>When Clapton joined the Bluesbreakers in 1965, Mayall had already been recording for a year, and been performing professionally long before that. Originally based in Manchester, Mayall moved to London in 1963 on the advice of British blues godfather Alexis Korner, who thought a living could be made playing the blues in the bigger city. Tracing a path through his various lineups of the '60s is a daunting task. At least 15 different editions of the Bluesbreakers were in existence from January 1963 through mid-1970. Some notable musicians (like guitarist Davy Graham, Mick Fleetwood, and Jack Bruce) passed through for little more than a cup of coffee; Mayall's longest-running employee, bassist John McVie, lasted about four years. The Bluesbreakers, like Fairport Convention or the Fall, was more a concept than an ongoing core. Mayall, too, had the reputation of being a difficult and demanding employer, willing to give musicians their walking papers as his music evolved, although he also imparted invaluable schooling to them while the associations lasted.</P><P>Mayall recorded his debut single in early 1964; he made his first album, a live affair, near the end of the year. At this point the Bluesbreakers had a more pronounced R&amp;B influence than would be exhibited on their most famous recordings, somewhat in the mold of younger combos like the Animals and Rolling Stones. Quite respectable it was too, but the Bluesbreakers would take a turn for the purer with the recruitment of Eric Clapton in the spring of 1965. Clapton had left the Yardbirds in order to play straight blues, and the Bluesbreakers allowed him that freedom (or stuck to well-defined restrictions, depending upon your viewpoint). Clapton began to inspire reverent acclaim as one of Britain's top virtuosos, as reflected in the famous ~Clapton is God~ graffiti that appeared in London in the mid-'60s.</P><P>In professional terms, though, 1965 wasn't the best of times for the group, which had been dropped by Decca. Clapton even left the group for a few months for an odd trip to Greece, leaving Mayall to straggle on with various fill-ins, including Peter Green. Clapton did return in late 1965, around the time an excellent blues-rock single, ~I'm Your Witchdoctor~ (with searing sustain-laden guitar riffs), was issued on Immediate. By early 1966, the band was back on Decca, and recorded their landmark Bluesbreakers LP. This was the album that, with its clean, loud, authoritative licks, firmly established Clapton as a guitar hero, on both reverent covers of tunes by the likes of Otis Rush and Freddie King, and decent originals by Mayall himself. The record was also an unexpected commercial success, making the Top Ten in Britain. From that point on, in fact, Mayall became one of the first rock musicians to depend primarily upon the LP market; he recorded plenty of singles throughout the '60s, but none of them came close to becoming a hit.</P><P>Clapton left the Bluesbreakers in mid-1966 to form Cream with Jack Bruce, who had played with Mayall briefly in late 1965. Mayall turned quickly to Peter Green, who managed the difficult feat of stepping into Clapton's shoes and gaining respect as a player of roughly equal imagination and virtuosity, although his style was quite distinctly his own. Green recorded one LP with Mayall, A Hard Road, and several singles, sometimes writing material and taking some respectable lead vocals. Green's talents, like those of Clapton, were too large to be confined by sideman status, and in mid-1967 he left to form a successful band of his own, Fleetwood Mac.</P><P>Mayall then enlisted 19-year-old Mick Taylor; remarkably, despite the consecutive departures of two star guitarists, Mayall maintained a high level of popularity. The late '60s were also a time of considerable experimentation for the Bluesbreakers, which moved into a form of blues-jazz-rock fusion with the addition of a horn section, and then a retreat into mellower, acoustic-oriented music. Mick Taylor, the last of the famous triumvirate of Mayall-bred guitar heroes, left in mid-1969 to join the Rolling Stones. Yet in a way Mayall was thriving more than ever, as the U.S. market, which had been barely aware of him in the Clapton era, was beginning to open up for his music. In fact, at the end of the 1960s, Mayall moved to Los Angeles. 1969's The Turning Point, a live, all-acoustic affair, was a commercial and artistic high point.</P><P>In America at least, Mayall continued to be pretty popular in the early '70s. His band was no more stable than ever; at various points some American musicians flitted in and out of the Bluesbreakers, including Harvey Mandel, Canned Heat bassist Larry Taylor, and Don ~Sugarcane~ Harris. Although he's released numerous albums since and remained a prodigiously busy and reasonably popular live act, his post-1970 output generally hasn't matched the quality of his '60s work. Following collaborations with an unholy number of guest celebrities, in the early '80s he re-teamed with a couple of his more renowned vets, John McVie and Mick Taylor, for a tour. It's the '60s albums that you want, though there's little doubt that Mayall has over the past decades done a great deal to popularize the blues all over the globe, whether or not the music has meant much on record.</P>— <B>Richie Unterberger</B>",

Mayall acquits himself fairly well on this mostly original set (with occasional guest horns), though some of the material is fairly mundane.

Arriving during the tail end of teen pop's heyday, he crafted pop music for a more discerning audience, spiking his songcraft with jazz chords and literate turns of phrase. The combination proved to be quite popular, as Room for Squares went triple platinum before its follow-up release, Heavier Things, arrived in September 2003. Mayer continued to retool his sound with each album, however, moving beyond the material that had launched his career and adopting elements of rock, blues, and soul. Moreover, he partnered with legends of several genres, making guest appearances on albums by Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton, and B.B. King, while touring alongside jazz icon Herbie Hancock. Mayer also retained enough pop/rock foundation to continue his reign of the charts, making him one of the decade's most popular songwriters.</p><p>Born in Bridgeport, CT, and raised in the nearby town of Fairfield, Mayer began playing blues as a teenager. By 1997, his skill on the electric guitar was enough to warrant admission into the Berklee College of Music, although Mayer dropped out after two semesters to pursue a songwriting career in Atlanta. Working alongside former classmate Clay Cook, he frequented the local coffeehouse circuit and began co-writing material that melded palatable pop/rock with unexpected flourishes. Cook and Mayer parted ways shortly thereafter, however, with Cook joining the Marshall Tucker Band's touring lineup for several years. Now a solo artist by default, Mayer recorded several of the duo's songs, packaged them alongside a handful of his own compositions, and self-released the EP in 1999 under the title Inside Wants Out.</p><p>Mayer secured a deal with Aware Records in early 2000, and recording sessions for his debut album commenced later that year with producer John Alagia, renowned for his work with Dave Matthews and Ben Folds Five. Although Inside Wants Out had been a decidedly acoustic effort, Room for Squares proved to be a more expansive affair, with several of Mayer's old songs receiving new, radio-ready arrangements. Released in 2001 by both Aware and Columbia Records, the album quickly launched Mayer's career, with ~No Such Thing~ and ~Your Body Is a Wonderland~ both becoming Top 20 hits.</p><p>As Mayer hit the road in support of the album, his considerable talent as a lead guitarist (a skill that had been downplayed during Room for Squares) flourished, leading him to showcase several blues-influenced solos on his 2003 live album, Any Given Thursday. That same year, Mayer won his first Grammy Award for ~Your Body Is a Wonderland.~ He returned to the Grammy ceremony two years later, this time to accept a pair of awards for ~Daughters,~ a soulful ballad from his lucrative sophomore release, Heavier Things. Commercial and critical success notwithstanding, Mayer's interest in other genres convinced him to take a brief break from pop music, and he tested his instrumental chops by collaborating with blues artists (Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Eric Clapton) and jazz legends (John Scofield, Herbie Hancock). He also assembled the John Mayer Trio, whose bluesy rock & roll was displayed on the band's first and only release, Try!</p><p>Mayer returned to his solo career with 2006's Continuum, a warmly received album that saw him focusing on blues, pop, and contemporary soul. ~Gravity~ found modest success as a single, but ~Waiting on the World to Change~ proved to be the album's commercial highlight, cracking the Top 20 in February 2007 and winning a Grammy that same month. Later that year, Mayer achieved his highest-charting single to date with ~Say,~ a song from the Rob Reiner film The Bucket List. After ~Say~ peaked at number 12, the song was included in a reissued version of Continuum, and it took home yet another Grammy Award (along with ~Gravity~) in early 2009. Following the release of a live album, Where the Light Is, Mayer once again returned to the studio in 2009, this time to record Battle Studies.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Andrew Leahey</strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>A few nights prior to writing this review, I reviewed John Mayer's Toronto concert. The very idea that he performed at the city's Air Canada Centre was a big leap from my standpoint. With two albums to his credit, the thought of him filling half of the venue would've been a plus. But when the place nearly sold out, it was a big surprise. It's that same buzz surrounding the Connecticut-born and now Atlanta-based performer that is making his new album a big deal. But is it all that big of a deal? Well, in some cases yes and in others, particularly the last few songs, no. Oh god no!</p><p>The opening track, ~Clarity~, starts off with a simple acoustic guitar and a steady handclap that works nicely in the background. Here Mayer starts off slowly before moving into a style that yearns for adult-contemporary radio. Light but not lightweight, punchy but not over-the-top, the chorus just ambles along. Mayer hates being compared to Dave Matthews, but if it looks like a duck and sounds like a duck (not that either party does), the comparisons will be there. If Matthews had done more of this on his solo debut, the results might have been better. The ensuing tune, the leadoff single ~Bigger than My Body~, makes the album soar for a brief period of time. Having all the right parts in nearly all the right places, the tune is easily the single. Unfortunately, Mayer doesn't revisit this up-tempo format often for the album's remainder.</p><p>~Something's Missing~, which is also found on Mayer's live album Any Given Thursday, has a soulful flavor that works to his strengths. The guitar riff resembles Bruce Cockburn or Sting, but it still has its effect later on. The checklist itemized near the conclusion is another asset Mayer has going for him: strong songwriting without being too highbrow or quirky. ~New Deep~ sounds like an extension of the previous song, with nearly a similar arrangement with less edge. Some might consider this a breather, but given how it drops off later, it's not really that bad. What is perhaps the album's highlight is ~Come Back to Bed~, a horn-tinged Motown-esque slow dance that Mayer pulls off with flying colors. Drawing the listener in early and often, Mayer's blues guitar prowess is shown in spots. ~And I won't sleep through this / I survive on the breath you are finished with~, he sings.</p><p>~Home Life~ is more urban sounding with its brand of back-beat and structure. Although building to a relatively decent chorus, it seems to miss the mark and falls flat from the first chorus onwards. Fans who find no fault with their heroes will lap this type of song up, but the groove comes too late to right this musical ship. Thankfully, ~Split Screen Sadness~ atones for the last tune. Bringing to mind early alternative rock, the bass line and Mayer's vocal shine while the keyboards add an anthem-like quality. It's also possibly as close as Mayer will ever get to a U2 effort. Slow building but definitely a toe-tapper, the song can basically do no wrong, even in its mellower melancholic lines. ~I still wish you'd fought me 'til your dying day / Don't let me get away~, he sings as if he's been influenced in some way by the Cure's Robert Smith.</p><p>The last three tracks have one promising song. The acoustic folk-like ~Daughters~ brings Sting to mind, but it's definitely a breather song when played live. The simple strumming and wordplay mesh well together. But the final two tracks sound more like filler than anything here. It's a noticeable drop as ~Only Heart~ tries for a pop rock idea, but it sounds far too forced and, to a lesser, extent, rushed. ~Do not waste this evening~, Mayer opens the song. Perhaps he's muttering to himself as the song is just too glossy and color-by-numbers. What is more depressing is how it shines compared to ~Wheel~, a tune left best to people like Ron Sexsmith. The chorus tends to keep it together a tad, but it seems too mediocre. Overall, Heavier Things is a sophomore effort that doesn't have as many drawbacks as one might assume. Seems he's in it for the long haul.</p>&mdash; <b>Jason MacNeil</b>"

				"review": "<p>What got into John Mayer? Sometime after the release of his 2003 sophomore album, Heavier Things, a perfectly pleasant affair that expanded on the dreamy, mellow adult pop of his breakthrough hit, ~Your Body Is a Wonderland,~ he decided that he just didn't want to follow that direction anymore. He started penning a monthly column for Esquire magazine, within which he hinted that his musical tastes were far broader than his recordings suggested, and then he started cameoing all over the place, appearing on albums by Buddy Guy, Herbie Hancock, B.B. King, Eric Clapton, and John Scofield -- heavy hitters one and all, yet none of them seemed to have much to do with Mayer's music, at least on the surface. These veterans recognized something within Mayer's playing, but more importantly, he realized that he needed to push himself further and decided to expand his horizons by seizing the opportunity to play with these masters and then incorporating what he learned into his own music.</p> </p>He toured as a power trio with studio pros Steve Jordan and Pino Palladino and recorded the live album Try! while on the road. There are no two ways about it: anybody who dismissed Mayer as a lite Dave Matthews wannabe based on his first two records will be forced to reassess him on the basis of this excellent record. While he still has some vocal tics that bring to mind Matthews and certainly shares an affection for lengthy live jams, Mayer has developed serious chops that transcend boilerplate jam band rock, where the groove and feel is more important than what's played. Here, Mayer is pushed by Jordan and Palladino -- and he pays back the favor by giving them equal billing on the album's front cover, which is unusual for any pop/rock star of his popularity (the cover also marks the second Blue Note allusion in Mayer's oeuvre, which is surely not a coincidence) -- and he rises to the challenge with muscular playing that's his best playing on record. Not just that, but there's a palpable grit to Try! -- and a sultry smoothness to the mellow numbers -- unheard on his previous studio albums. That alone would make Try! not just noteworthy, but a step forward for Mayer. But what makes it more remarkable is that Mayer takes an even greater risk by relying on new material for this album. There are two older songs -- ~Something's Missing~ and the hit ~Daughters,~ both from Heavier Things -- but the rest consists of covers of Jimi Hendrix and Ray Charles (~Wait Until Tomorrow~ and ~I Got a Woman,~ respectively) and new songs that showcase Mayer's earthier, blues-rock direction. Although he sometimes dips into blues-rock clichés -- particularly on the slow-crawling ~Out of My Mind~ -- it's only on occasion (and when he does tread that familiar ground, he does so with conviction), and the songs overall are his strongest, most ambitious set of tunes yet. And that's what's most impressive about Try! -- Mayer has expanded what he can do as a musician and a writer and in the process has definitively separated himself from the pack of sensitive, jammy modern singer/songwriters. Based on this, he has more heart, soul, ambition, and chops than the rest of them combined.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<P>Anybody who was initially confused by singer/songwriter John Mayer's foray into blues with 2005's Try! John Mayer Trio Live in Concert could only have been further confounded upon listening to the album and coming to the realization that it was actually good. And not just kinda good, especially for guy who had been largely labeled as a Dave Matthews clone, but really, truthfully, organically as good as a blues album in its own right. However, for longtime fans who had been keeping tabs on Mayer, the turn might not have been so unexpected. Soon after the release of his 2003 sophomore album, the laid-back, assuredly melodic Heavier Things, Mayer began appearing on albums by such iconic blues and jazz artists as Buddy Guy, B.B. King, and Herbie Hancock. And not just singing, but playing guitar next to musicians legendary on the instrument. In short, he was seeking out these artists in an attempt to delve into the roots of the blues, a music he obviously has a deep affection for.</P><P>Rather than his blues trio being a one-off side project completely disconnected to his past work, it is clear now that it was the next step in his musical development. And truthfully, while Try! certainly showcases Mayer's deft improvisational blues chops, it's more of a blues/soul album in the tradition of such electric blues legends as Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan, and features songs by Mayer that perfectly marry his melodic songcraft and his blues-slinger inclinations. In fact, what seemed at the time a nod to his largely female fan base (the inclusion of ~Daughters~ and ~Something's Missing~ off Heavier Things), was actually a hint that he was bridging his sound for his listeners, showing them where he was going.</P><P>That said, nothing he did up until the excellent, expansive Try! could have prepared you for the monumental creative leap forward that is Mayer's 2006 studio effort Continuum. Working with his blues trio/rhythm section of bassist Pino Palladino and drummer Steve Jordan, along with guest spots by trumpeter Roy Hargrove and guitarist Ben Harper, Mayer brings all of his recent musical explorations and increasing talents as a singer/songwriter to bear on Continuum. Produced solely by Mayer and Jordan, the album is a devastatingly accomplished, fully realized effort that in every way exceeds expectations and positions Mayer as one of the most relevant artists of his generation.</P><P>Adding weight to the notion that Mayer's blues trio is more than just a creative indulgence, he has carried over two tracks from the live album in ~Vultures~ and the deeply metaphorical soul ballad ~Gravity.~ These are gut-wrenchingly poignant songs that give voice to a generation of kids raised on TRL teen stars and CNN sound bytes who've found themselves all grown up and fighting a war of ~beliefs.~ Grappling with a handful of topics -- social and political, romantic and sexual, pointedly personal and yet always universal in scope -- Mayer's Continuum here earns a legitimate comparison to Marvin Gaye's What's Going On?. Nobody -- not a single one of Mayer's contemporaries -- has come up with anything resembling a worthwhile anti-war anthem that is as good and speaks for their generation as much as his ~Waiting on the World to Change~ -- and he goes and hangs the whole album on it as the first single.</P><P>It's a bold statement of purpose that is carried throughout the album, not just in sentiment, but also tone. Continuum is a gorgeously produced, brilliantly stripped-to-basics album that incorporates blues, soft funk, R&amp;B, folk and pop in a sound that is totally owned by Mayer. It's no stretch when trying to describe the sound of Continuum to color it in the light of work by such legends as Sting, Eric Clapton, Sade, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Steve Winwood. In fact, the sustained adult contemporary tone of the album, which could easily have become turgid, boring, or dated never does, and brings to mind such classic late-'80s albums as Sting's Nothing Like the Sun, Clapton's Journeyman, and Vaughan's In Step.</P><P>At every turn, Continuum finds Mayer to be a mature, thoughtful, and gifted musician who fully grasps his place not just in the record industry, but in life.</P><P>— <B>Matt Collar</B></P>"

John Mayer Trio Live in Concert and finally his smash Grammy-winning 2006 effort, Continuum. Essentially, the concert is designed to showcase Mayer's ability to move from melodic soft rock and pop to folky solo numbers and rockin' blues. Generally, the conceit works and the concert does shine a light, so to speak, on Mayer's virtuosic musical chops. However, segmenting this concert into such specific aesthetic sounds loses some of the diverse flow a Mayer concert usually has. It should be noted that the concert is also available on DVD and Blu-ray, where you get see each band and appreciate the diversity among the ensembles. That said, for fans of Mayer the songwriter, you really can't lose, as the guy is hard-pressed to come up with a bad song, and tracks like the fan favorite ~Daughters~ and the bittersweet ~Stop This Train~ really benefit from the acoustic reading Mayer gives them here. Similarly, by putting ~'Who Do You Think I Was,~ ~Vultures,~ and his inspired take on Jimi Hendrix's ~Bold as Love~ in the middle electric trio section, Mayer builds the energy of the concert, perfectly setting up the pop/blues cornucopia of the final large ensemble set. Beginning with the hit ~Waiting on the World to Change,~ Mayer's last set (on disc two) is really the set most fans will gravitate toward, as it finds Mayer and his backing group of stellar sideman diving headlong into such soulful numbers as ~Why Georgia~ and ~I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You),~ while also making room for such bluesy nuggets as his Stevie Ray Vaughan-inspired reworking of the Ray Charles hit ~I Don't Need No Doctor.~ Admittedly sprawling and ambitious, Where the Light Is is nonetheless a dynamic showcase for Mayer, who never fails to shine.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Matt Collar</strong></p>"

Retaining more than a modicum of the slick soul-blues undertones of Continuum, Mayer fashions a modern groove album, a record that maintains a smooth seductive vibe so thoroughly it spills into a weird one-man band cover of ~Crossroads,~ turning Clapton's contained Cream masterwork into something about vibe, not virtuosity. Mayer remains a disciple of Slowhand, but he shows an unusual interest in the big AOR stylings of Journeyman, along with Stevie Ray Vaughan's In Step, creating a coolly clean blend of synths and Strats, one that's as much about texture as it is song -- something perfectly appropriate for a make-out album like this. Sometimes, Mayer dips too heavily toward the texture -- not just in the sound sculptures in the bedding of ~Heartbreak Warfare,~ but even the strum-n-croon of ~All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye~ -- and his love-as-war metaphors land with the thud of a dud bomb, but he can't resist a good, tight melody and builds the bulk of Battle Studies upon them: the elegant ~Half of My Heart,~ the stoned self-deprecating wit of ~Who Says,~ the softly soulful ~Perfectly Lonely.~ Here, Mayer is effortlessly seductive and somewhat irresistible, and it's easy to see why the ladies love cool John.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Stephen Thomas Erlewine<strong></p>"

		"biography": "<p>Mike McClellan was born in NSW and his first big break came when he won a television talent quest. From there he became a regular on the TV series 'Sound of Music'. At this point, Mike formed his own band called the 'Currency Blues Co' in the mid-sixties. During the 60's, he trained as a teacher in Armidale and taught in schools in New South Wales before recording his first album for Col Joye's ATA records in 1972, under his own name. </p><p>He recorded this debut album with the assistance of respective artists such as Graham Lowndes and Duncan McGuire (Ayers Rock). The album was released in June 1972 and although it received some excellent reviews, nothing much came of it, probably because his record company ATA did nothing to promote it. They did manage to get out a poster three months after it had been released but it received no airplay to speak of. Two singles were lifted from the album  ~Some Other Sunrise~ and ~Suzie, Get Off This Train~ but neither made an impression on the charts. In my opinion, ATA should have released ~Lonely Man~ as a single, as it is clearly the strongest track on the album.  Col didn't like his new material so he left and Mike recorded his next (and all subsequent albums) with EMI Australia.</p><p>His second album, 'Ask Any Dancer', was released in England and Europe and in November, 1974 he made the charts with 'Song and Dance Man'. The single was highly acclaimed and was covered by artists in England, America and South Africa.</p><p>In 1975, he released a third album on the EMI label entitled 'Until The Song Is Done' but this too made no real impact on the charts as did the single ~Carry Me~.</p><p>In March, 1976 Mike came up with a more aggressive, rock style sound on his 'Coming Up For Air album'. A single, 'Caddie' (inspired by the movie) was lifted from it and its release coincided with his successful tour of Australia with Melanie.</p><p>A proposed trip to the US following an offer to record in Nashville unfortunately didn't materialise and it wasn't until mid 1977 that Mike surfaced again with an album and a single entitled 'Another Night'.</p><p>In September '77 he recorded a live album for EMI which was released in November under the title of An Evening With Mike McClellan - Live.</p><p>In 1979, he went on to host a television country music show.  In 1982, he toured overseas and his return to Australia in ‘83 marked another change in his career.  Weary of the constant traveling he sought more stability for he and his family.  Mojo, then regarded as the most dynamic ad agency in the country, persuaded him to write for them.  For 2 years he contributed some of the most memorable advertising on television, writing the concepts, words and music for clients such as Australian Airlines, Red Rooster, Channel 9 and growing the already established XXXX and Tooheys campaigns for the agency.  Invigorated by new challenges he and a partner left Mojo and set up their own agency which they called Kazoo.  It grew rapidly over the period from ‘86 to ‘91.  The 2 partners became 3, the staff went from 3 to 30 and the billings through the roof.</p><p>Through all the demands on his time he still managed to release a new album in 1990.  The Heartland is considered by many who know his work to be as good as anything he has recorded and marked a return to the EMI label.</p><p>He subsequently sold his share holding in Kazoo to re-establish Mike McClellan Pty Ltd and take complete control of his own destiny once more.  He needed the time to write for himself and take advantage of the dramatic changes that had been happening in the communications industry.</p><p>1998 marked the release of a single commissioned for Warner Music.  But the three songs it contained were a little different to past McClellan discs.  They were tributes to three great Australian sportsmen, Mark Taylor, the much-admired former Aussie cricket captain, the great Sir Donald Bradman, and David Campese, often called “the Bradman of Rugby.”</p><p>Late 2001 saw the release of a comprehensive retrospective of his recording career.  Personally chosen and carefully remastered from the original tapes Time. And Time Again. is a double CD containing 35 of his best songs.  Among them are re-recordings of two from his very first album, a studio version of California Cool that was only ever released as a B side on a single and New York City Blues, a never before released gem that was recorded during the sessions for The Heartland CD but didn’t fit comfortably with the other songs.</p><p>Late 2001 also saw the first of what were standout concerts with his old friends Kevin Johnson (who wrote Rock’n Roll I Gave You All The Best Years of My Life) and Doug Ashdown (Winter In America).  A sell out crowd at Sydney’s Basement and a standing ovation said it all – “Their artistic and intelligent acoustic alchemy had a capacity house singing, stamping and tingling beyond the witching hour.  A night indelibly imprinted”, said Glenn A. Baker.</p><p>In 2005, in conjunction with Andrew Pattison, who established Melbourne’s premier acoustic venue the Troubadour, he brought to Australia and shared the bill with the wonderful US singer/songwriter Danny O’Keefe.  The concert crowds reinforced his belief that there was still a sizeable, enthusiastic audience in Australia for acoustic music of depth, conviction and real quality.</p>",

		"firstname": "John",
		"lastname": "McLaughlin",
		"name": "John McLaughlin",
		"biography": "<p>One of fusion's most virtuosic guitar soloists, John McLaughlin placed his blazing speed in the service of a searching spiritual passion that has kept his music evolving and open to new influences. Whether shredding on electric or simmering quietly on acoustic, McLaughlin's intensity and underappreciated versatility have nearly always kept his playing vital, and his best moments -- whether as a solo artist or bandmember -- represent some of fusion's greatest recordings, including 1971's The Inner Mounting Flame and 1973's Birds of Fire with his supergroup Mahavishnu Orchestra, which included keyboardist Jan Hammer and drummer Billy Cobham. In 1976, he formed the acoustic quartet Shakti with a trio of Indian musicians. They issued three acclaimed albums as one of the first world fusion outfits. He continued to balance his time between electric fusion and acoustic projects, the most notable of the latter was the live A Night in San Francisco with guitarists Al Di Meola and Paco De Lucia. They split after a studio offering and reunited in the '90s with the celebrated The Guitar Trio. In the 21st century, McLaughlin continued to deliver and tour a wealth of diverse projects, but his focus was once again on incorporating fusion from both ends of the rock and jazz spectrum, as evidenced by 2008's Floating Point and 2015's post-psychedelic Black Light with his band 4th Dimension.</p><p>McLaughlin was born January 4, 1942, in Yorkshire, England, and began playing guitar at age 11. Initially attracted to blues and swing, he worked with British artists like Georgie Fame, Graham Bond, Brian Auger, and Ginger Baker. McLaughlin formed his own band in 1968 and recorded the excellent debut Extrapolation in early 1969. Later that year he moved to New York to join Tony Williams' groundbreaking fusion band Lifetime, and appeared on the classic Emergency! Through Williams, McLaughlin was invited to join Miles Davis' band, and became an important part of fusion landmarks like In a Silent Way, Bitches Brew, and A Tribute to Jack Johnson. In 1970, wanting to explore acoustic and Eastern music, McLaughlin recorded the classic My Goal's Beyond; he soon left Davis, and after one further solo album, Devotion, McLaughlin spent some time woodshedding.</p><p>He re-emerged in 1971 as leader of the Mahavishnu Orchestra, a seminal band that did much to define and popularize early jazz-rock fusion, as evidenced by the albums The Inner Mounting Flame, Birds of Fire, and Visions of the Emerald Beyond. Pausing to record Love Devotion Surrender with Carlos Santana in 1972, McLaughlin led Mahavishnu until 1975. Returning to spiritual preoccupations on My Goal's Beyond, he then formed Shakti, which fused acoustic jazz with Indian music over the course of three albums. McLaughlin returned to his solo career in the late '70s, forming a backing outfit called the One Truth Band, and also recording the guitar trio albums Friday Night in San Francisco and Passion, Grace & Fire with fellow fusion burner Al di Meola and flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucia. As the '80s went along, McLaughlin experimented with classical-jazz hybrid composing; there was also a short-lived Mahavishnu reunion in the mid-'80s.</p><p>John McLaughlin Plays Bill Evans In the '90s McLaughlin continued to record steadily in both electric and acoustic groups. He signed to Verve, where he would remain for 13 years. Some of the more notable albums from that period include the acoustic Time Remembered: John McLaughlin Plays Bill Evans in 1993; After the Rain with Elvin Jones and Joey DeFrancesco in 1995; and 1996's The Promise, which featured the guitarist in a number of settings, including a reunion with his acoustic trio partners di Meola and de Lucia, and a trio with DeFrancesco and drummer Dennis Chambers. The drummer was also a part of McLaughlin's final album of the decade, Heart of Things, a furious bout of electric jazz.</p><p>The Believer The 21st century found McLaughlin in another nostalgic mood, releasing Remember Shakti: The Believer, a live set featuring the guitarist (playing electric guitar) with electric mandolinist U. Shrinivas, kanjira and ghatam player V. Selvaganesh, and legendary tabla player Zakir Hussain. While it wasn't a Shakti album proper, it nonetheless echoed that group's intricate and amazing rhythmic and harmonic breakthroughs. The group toured and released Saturday Night in Bombay a year later. McLaughlin's Euro-classical-leaning Thieves and Poets appeared in 2003. In 2004, WEA in Germany issued the massive 17-CD box set of McLaughlin's Montreux Concerts, which featured performances recorded between 1974 and 1996. Industrial Zen, released in 2006, was a mixed-bag recording where the guitarist's ambitions ran wild. It was his final album for Verve.</p><p>In 2008 McLaughlin issued Floating Point, an extension of many of the concepts on Industrial Zen, on the Abstract Logix imprint. The final track on that album was entitled ~Five Peace Band~; it served as the name for a supergroup assembled by McLaughlin and Chick Corea for a one-off world tour. The other members were saxophonist Kenny Garrett, drummer Vinnie Colaiuta, and bassist Christian McBride; an album of the same name was released in 2009 on Concord. To the One, issued in 2010, debuted his new 4th Dimension band, whose lineup included veterans of his other groups: Gary Husband on keyboards and drums, Etienne Mbappe on electric bass, and drummer Mike Mondesir. This group became a collaborative, creative anchor for the guitarist, much as the early Mahavishnu Orchestra had been.</p><p>McLaughlin resurfaced two years later with Now Here This. The album featured the lone change in the 4th Dimension lineup as drummer and vocalist Ranjit Barot replaced Mondesir. Barot had collaborated with the guitarist on Floating Point, but was long established and celebrated as a film composer, music director, arranger, and vocalist. He was also a longtime associate of filmmaker/composer A.R. Rahman. This group toured the world, and followed up with Now Here This in 2012. They were captured live on-stage during the last night of a tour at the Berklee College of Music; the set was released as The Boston Record in 2014.</p><p>Over the previous couple of years, McLaughlin had been in communication again with longtime friend de Lucia in hopes of recording together. It never happened. The Spanish guitarist passed away in February of 2014. McLaughlin and 4th Dimension released Black Light in the fall of 2015. Among its tracks was the acoustic number ~El Hombre Que Sabia,~ a tribute to the flamenco master. A concert album also featuring the ensemble, Live at Ronnie Scott's, appeared in 2017. That same year, McLaughlin embarked on what he described as a farewell tour, playing songs from Mahavishnu Orchestra's extensive catalog. In 2018, Abstract Logix issued Live in San Francisco -- a souvenir of a sold-out concert at the historic Warfield Theatre, that the guitarist last played 36 years earlier. His 4th Dimension band played encores of classic Mahavishnu Orchestra tunes with guitarist Jimmy Herring's nine-piece orchestra the Invisible Whip.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Steve Huey</strong></p>",

Yet the alert John McLaughlin follower will note that beyond the reliance upon South Indian instruments and scales, there are unbroken links to records like My Goal's Beyond and the high-speed electric music that McLaughlin was casting aside at the moment. McLaughlin called his new quintet Shakti, which means ~creative intelligence and beauty and power~ and the music here has all of that and something else, a ferocious streak inherited from the Mahavishnu days. McLaughlin ignites ~Joy~ by playing at a blazing speed, his cohorts Lakshminarayana Shankar (violin), Ramnad V. Raghavan and T.H. Vinayakram (mridangam), and Zakir Hussain (tabla) keeping up with the furious unison tempos with great dexterity and discipline, while a reworking of ~Lotus Feet~ forms a meditative interlude. Side two is taken up by a single, lengthy raga-like track in which McLaughlin combines his rapid-fire Western manner with note-bending techniques clearly emulating a sitar, and the Indians get plenty of dueling room. In its way, this fire-eating acoustic music is just as energizing as the most electrified Mahavishnu flights.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richard S. Ginell</strong></p>"

This quintet, along with bass and drums, contained two keyboard players, Francois Couturier and the noted classical pianist Katia Labeque (who was McLaughlin's companion). Labeque, seated at a Synclavier and a grand piano, has acres of technique and almost no feeling for jazz, though she is adept at providing moody backdrops, and her rapid-fire synth runs and Jarrett-like etudes on the Steinway aren't too far away stylistically from McLaughlin's helter-skelter flurries. In a continued homage to McLaughlin's once and future employer Miles Davis, ~Blues for L.W.~ brazenly quotes ~Blues for Pablo,~ and sometimes the music texturally resembles the heavily synthesized things that Miles would soon be putting out.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richard S.

Engaging in interplay at all kinds of tempos with bassist Kai Eckhardt and supported by the fleet, subtle drums and percussion of Trilok Gurtu, McLaughlin concentrates his energies on the acoustic guitar. Now and then, he flips a switch and plays through a guitar synthesizer whose broad attacks and occasional organ-like timbres often compensate nicely for the lack of a keyboardist. This trio encourages McLaughlin to display a funkier touch on his instrument without giving up any blinding speed; ~Pasha's Love~ contains unison flurries as furious as any from the first Mahavishnu group, only at a lower volume level. The final ~Blues for L.W.~ (Lech Walesa) climaxes with some vocal Indian syllabic jamming that joyously rounds out the concert.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richard S. Ginell</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Originally issued in 1996 when he was 54, The Promise offers a summation of all the places John McLaughlin has been in his career, and points directly toward his future. Featuring a wide range of musicians including appearances by the Free Spirits, the Guitar Trio, and an electric version of Shakti, the Promise is easily the most wide-ranging and diverse offering of McLaughlin's long career. Its contents encompass everything from straight post-bop and swinging soul-jazz to fusion to modern takes on East Indian music as it meets the West. As if this weren't enough, there are even moments with spoken word laced throughout, such as a verse of Dante read by Stefania Bombi toward the end of his scorching, funky, soul-jazz number ~Thelonius Melodius~ with B-3 organist Joey DeFrancesco and drummer Dennis Chambers. The set kicks off with one of its finest moments, a guitar-to-guitar reading of John Lewis' ~Django~ with Jeff Beck (bassist Pino Palladino, drummer Mark Mondesir, and drummer Tony Hymas round it out). Beck's solo is first; it is expansive as it moves from a gorgeous restating of the melody through slinky harmonic extrapolations. McLaughlin's answer is ambitious and intuitive. They then move toward one another and the melody, complementing each other perfectly. ~El Ciego~ is a complex, flamenco-tinged jazz number with McLaughlin trading knotty lines and soulful solos with Al di Meola and Paco de Lucia. ~Jazz Jungle~ is late 20th century fusion at its blazing best with Michael Brecker, Chambers, Don Alias, James Genus, and Jim Beard beginning almost nebulously before ratcheting the tempo and idea palettes to dizzying heights (Brecker is particularly brilliant). ~The Wish,~ with Zakir Hussein, Nishat Khan, and Trilok Gurtu, looks deeply into Indian classical music balanced by a European gaze. McLaughlin's engagement with Khan's sitar creates nearly rapturous expression, all the while contained inside a texture that is as atmospheric as it is exotic. ~Shin Jin Rui~ employs the same band as ~Jazz Jungle,~ with the exception of the saxophone, played by David Sanborn. His playing is riskier than on his own records, his alto juxtaposed with McLaughlin's guitar, a study in funky, electric jazz modernism. The set closes with a lovely all-acoustic reading of Jimmy Rowles' ~The Peacocks~ with guitarist Phillipe Loi and bassist Yan Maresz, and a verse by Lorca read by Susana Beatrix as an end cap. Ultimately, The Promise stands as one of McLaughlin's towering achievements as a guitarist and leader.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

As before, when the name was last floated in the 1980s, it is a very different sound, but closer to the original Mahavishnu blend than the '80s version ever got. There are rapid-fire unison statements as in the old days, but now softer and more complex in texture and definitely lower in volume. Dennis Chambers, a leftover from the McLaughlin organ trio of the early '90s, is probably the most incendiary drummer McLaughlin has featured since Billy Cobham, and he really mixes things up throughout the CD, including a sizzling one-on-one duel with the guitarist on the questionably titled ~Acid Jazz.~ McLaughlin brandishes his technique with the old flash, yet as has been the pattern in his middle age, his tone is mellow and rounded, often heard through the transforming gauze of MIDI electronics. The experienced Jim Beard is responsible for the keyboard textures; Gary Thomas offers capable tenor, soprano and flute leads; Matthew Garrison (son of Jimmy) is the excellent electric bass player, and they are often augmented by the Latin percussion of Victor Williams. Again, one can say that McLaughlin's playing is more musical and charged with greater authority now than a quarter of a century ago, though not as hot in temperature. Even so, this is the warmest his music has been since the Mahavishnu days.</p>&mdash; <b>Richard S. Ginell</b>"

				"review": "<p>When Eastern classical musicians and Western jazz or pop musicians get together to jam, the result are always heartwarming; two wildly disparate traditions coming together to make music is such an irresistible gesture of human unity and cross-cultural cooperation. What's not to love? Frankly, what's not to love is often the music itself, which all too frequently is long on multicultural good intentions and short on things like coherence, interest, and hooks. The intermittently mystical jazz guitarist John McLaughlin, who has been nursing an India jones for decades now, is hardly innocent of such offenses. But on The Believer, a live set featuring McLaughlin, electric mandolinist U. Shrinivas, kanjira and ghatam player V. Slevaganesh, and legendary tabla player Zakir Hussain, he delivers a gloriously tight, rhythmically thrilling program of original compositions (as well as one contribution each from Shrinivas and Hussain). The group is called Remember Shakti in reference to Shakti, the similarly configured band that McLaughlin co-led in the mid-'70s. If anything, his playing has grown more exciting than it was then; listening to him negotiate the thorny rhythmic changes of this music in unison with Shrinivas and to both of them bouncing off the complexly woven rhythmic patterns laid out by Hussain and Slevaganesh is not only impressive, but uplifting as well. Highlights include the downright funky ~Anna~ and Shrinivas' composition ~Maya.~ Very highly recommended.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Rick Anderson</strong></p>"

(The title is a deliberate play on 1980's Friday Night in San Francisco.) McLaughlin's electric guitar and Zakir Hussain's tabla remain at the core of the group's sound. U. Shrinivas (on mandolin) and V. Selvaganesh (on kanjira, ghatam, and mridangam, all Indian percussion instruments) remain from the previous album, but there are also a number of Indian guest musicians, giving the music many added dimensions. The most remarkable guests are Debashish Bhattacharya on Hindustani slide guitar, Shankar Mahadevan on vocals, and Shiv Kumar Sharma on santur, an Indian hammered dulcimer. Sharma composed the second track, ~Shringar~; nearly half an hour long, it consists almost entirely of a hypnotic dialogue between santur and guitar. Mahadevan's vocal performance on the opening ~Luki~ resounds with spiritual power, while Shrinivas's ~Giriraj Sudha~ gives a sunny, optimistic lift to the somewhat mournful set.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>David R.

				"review": "<p>Since the late '60s, John McLaughlin's name has been synonymous with electric fusion guitar. But McLaughlin is equally accomplished on the acoustic guitar; he has a long history of excelling on that instrument, which he plays exclusively on Thieves and Poets. This 2003 release, in fact, isn't fusion in the amplified jazz-rock sense but rather acoustic-oriented post-bop with Euro-classical leanings. Thieves and Poets finds McLaughlin joining forces with two of Europe's classical outfits: the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie (with Renato Rivolta serving as conductor) and the much smaller, guitar-oriented Aighetta Quartet. The former appears on the title track, a lavish, three-movement, 26-minute orchestral work that has hints of Spanish flamenco at times. Meanwhile, Aighetta joins McLaughlin on four standards, all of which are dedicated to pianists he admires; the British guitarist acknowledges Bill Evans on ~My Romance,~ Herbie Hancock on ~Stella by Starlight,~ Chick Corea on ~My Foolish Heart,~ and Gonzalo Rubalcaba on Luiz Eca's ~The Dolphin.~ But he certainly does so in a personal, introspective way. Yes, ~My Romance,~ ~Stella by Starlight,~ and ~My Foolish Heart~ are warhorses that have been beaten to death over the years — great songs that have been recorded so many times that some jazz enthusiasts feel there should be a moratorium on them in the 21st century. But McLaughlin is such an accomplished, distinctive musician that he's allowed a warhorse or two (or three). Besides, he plays beautifully on these standards, and his lyricism is extremely individualistic. Hearing McLaughlin (who turned 60 in 2002) embracing Tin Pan Alley songs with a classical guitar group is hardly the same as hearing some 19-year-old, knee-jerk Sarah Vaughan wannabe attempting to squeeze the last drops out of blood from them. It's the difference between mindlessly going through the motions and saying something personal — and on this memorable CD, McLaughlin's playing is undeniably personal.</p>&mdash; <b>Alex Henderson</b>"

		"name": "Blind Willie McTell",
		"biography": "<p>Willie Samuel McTell was one of the blues' greatest guitarists, and also one of the finest singers ever to work in blues. A major figure with a local following in Atlanta from the 1920s onward, he recorded dozens of sides throughout the '30s under a multitude of names -- all the better to juggle ~exclusive~ relationships with many different record labels at once -- including Blind Willie, Blind Sammie, Hot Shot Willie, and Georgia Bill, as a backup musician to Ruth Mary Willis. And those may not have been all of his pseudonyms -- we don't even know what he chose to call himself, although ~Blind Willie~ was his preferred choice among friends. Much of what we do know about him was learned only years after his death, from family members and acquaintances. His family name was, so far as we know, McTier or McTear, and the origins of the ~McTell~ name are unclear. What is clear is that he was born into a family filled with musicians -- his mother and his father both played guitar, as did one of his uncles, and he was also related to Georgia Tom Dorsey, who later became the Rev. Thomas Dorsey.</p><p>McTell was born in Thomson, Georgia, near Augusta, and raised near Statesboro. He was probably born blind, although early in his life he could perceive light in one eye. His blindness never became a major impediment, however, and it was said that his sense of hearing and touch were extraordinary. His first instruments were the harmonica and the accordion, but as soon as he was big enough he took up the guitar and showed immediate aptitude on the new instrument. He played a standard six-string acoustic until the mid-'20s, and never entirely abandoned the instrument, but from the beginning of his recording career, he used a 12-string acoustic in the studio almost exclusively. McTell's technique on the 12-string instrument was unique. Unlike virtually every other bluesman who used one, he relied not on its resonances as a rhythm instrument, but, instead, displayed a nimble, elegant slide and finger-picking style that made it sound like more than one guitar at any given moment. He studied at a number of schools for the blind, in Georgia, New York, and Michigan, during the early '20s, and probably picked up some formal musical knowledge. He worked medicine shows, carnivals, and other outdoor venues, and was a popular attraction, owing to his sheer dexterity and a nasal singing voice that could sound either pleasant or mournful, and incorporated some of the characteristics normally associated with white hillbilly singers.</p><p>McTell's recording career began in late 1927 with two sessions for Victor records, eight sides including ~Statesboro Blues.~ McTell's earliest sides were superb examples of storytelling in music, coupled with dazzling guitar work. All of McTell's music showed extraordinary power, some of it delightfully raucous ragtime, other examples evoking darker, lonelier sides of the blues, and all of it displaying astonishingly rich guitar work.</p><p>McTell worked under a variety of names, and with a multitude of partners, including his one-time wife Ruthy Kate Williams (who recorded with him under the name Ruby Glaze), and also Buddy Moss and Curley Weaver. McTell cut some of his best songs more than once in his career. Like many bluesmen, he recorded under different names simultaneously, and was even signed to Columbia and Okeh Records, two companies that ended up merged at the end of the '30s, at the same time, under two names. His recording career never gave McTell quite as much success as he had hoped, partly due to the fact that some of his best work appeared during the depths of the Depression. He was uniquely popular in Atlanta, where he continued to live and work throughout most of his career, and, in fact, was the only blues guitarist of any note from the city to remain active in the city until well after World War II.</p><p>McTell was well-known enough that Library of Congress archivist John Lomax felt compelled to record him in 1940, although during the war, like many other acoustic country bluesmen, his recording career came to a halt. Luckily for McTell and generations of listeners after him, however, there was a brief revival of interest in acoustic country-blues after World War II that brought him back into the studio. Amazingly enough, the newly founded Atlantic Records -- which was more noted for its recordings of jazz and R&B -- took an interest in McTell and cut 15 songs with him in Atlanta during 1949. The one single released from these sessions, however, didn't sell, and most of those recordings remained unheard for more than 20 years after they were made. A year later, however, he was back in the studio, this time with his longtime partner Curley Weaver, cutting songs for the Regal label. None of these records sold especially well, however, and while McTell kept playing for anyone who would listen, the bitter realities of life had finally overtaken him, and he began drinking on a regular basis. He was rediscovered in 1956, just in time to get one more historic session down on tape. He left music soon after, to become a pastor of a local church, and he died of a brain hemorrhage in 1959, his passing so unnoticed at the time that certain reissues in the '70s referred to McTell as still being alive in the '60s.</p><p>Blind Willie McTell was one of the giants of the blues, as a guitarist and as a singer and recording artist. Hardly any of his work as passed down to us on record is less than first-rate, and this makes most any collection of his music worthwhile. A studious and highly skilled musician whose skills transcended the blues, he was equally adept at ragtime, spirituals, story-songs, hillbilly numbers, and popular tunes, excelling in all of these genres. He could read and write music in braille, which gave him an edge on many of his sighted contemporaries, and was also a brilliant improvisor on the guitar, as is evident from his records. McTell always gave an excellent account of himself, even in his final years of performing and recording.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>",

But Jorge Rossy, the group's drummer, began spending more and more time away from music and at his home in Spain. Mehldau, who is almost prolific in his recording process, recruited drummer Jeff Ballard to replace Rossy on Day Is Done. Ballard has worked off and on with bassist Larry Grenadier in the trio Fly with saxman Mark Turner, so he's not a total stranger to the process. Yet Ballard is a different kind of drummer, more diverse and certainly more kinetic in his approach, as evidenced by this disc. This is Mehldau's most energetic and rigorous recording to date. These ten cuts are comprised mainly of covers, though aside from ~Alfie,~ there isn't anything here approaching a standard. There are tunes here by the Beatles (~She's Leaving Home~ and a glorious solo version of ~Martha My Dear~ with a Scarlatti-esque study in counterpoint to usher it in), Paul Simon (a jaunty read of ~50 Ways to Leave Your Lover~), Nick Drake (the title cut), and even Radiohead (in the crackling energy of ~Knives Out~). There are two fine originals as well: the shimmering ~Artis,~ with its striated right-hand work, and the Latin-tinged ~Turtle Town,~ a somewhat breezy ballad that is nonetheless knotty and off-kilter enough in its melody and in Mehldau's solo to become complex and challenging. Day Is Done is another exceptional chapter in the Mehldau catalog, one that showcases a willingness to stretch itself to the breaking point and open up the band to a wider array of approaches.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

				"review": "<p>The Way Up is the Pat Metheny Group's debut offering for Nonesuch Records. Comprised of a single, sprawling, 68-minute composition by Metheny and Lyle Mays -- divided into four sections on CD -- it is an unprecedented new direction for the band. The lineup is the same as on the live Speak of Now from 2003 -- Metheny and Mays on keyboards, bassist Steve Rodby, drummer Antonio Sanchéz, and trumpeter/vocalist Cuong Vu. New to the roster is Swiss/American harmonicat Gregoire Maret. While the sound here is instantly recognizable as PMG, it is dazzling and labyrinthine in shape, sound, and texture. Painstakingly composed, The Way Up also offers large open sections for solo improvisation and group interplay. The work's theme is stated in part one, unfolding gradually as skeletal layered guitars, samples, and other gentle electronics ease the frame into view, Sanchéz's drumming creating an insistent pulse. Mays' piano and Metheny's guitar engage in contrapuntal arpeggios and Vu enters haltingly with the actual line before the ensemble engages it as a whole. Brief melodic interludes usher in the longish second section seamlessly, where lyric fragments become full-blown statements, as the band's trademark restrained dynamic slips in unobtrusively before erupting into sheer euphoria with layered, crunchy, and fat six-strings, lilting harmonicas, and trumpets in tandem, all buoyed by Mays and Rodby, who underscore Sanchéz's skittering cymbal dance.</p><p>As it progresses, the band takes more chances, walking out onto a ledge and simply jumping off -- while never losing the deep, lush lyricism inherent in the composition's body. The thematic body and the hook at its core are infectious. These, too, open inwardly to an entirely new set of musical ideas in the middle of the section that changes no less than three times in its 26-minute duration. Mays' piano, an acoustic guitar, and Rodby's fretless bass tiptoe ghostlike into part three before Vu once more shimmers and spatters colorful notes across the top in a hush before allowing Maret to bring the entire line into being. Spare, careful, and emotionally moving, it builds until the entire band gels and cracks it into a breezy elegant walk through airy harmonics and slippery rhythms before notions of counterpoint, dense syncopated rhythmic figures (à la Steve Reich), and tight, tense dynamics segue into the final section. Here is where all previous elements come together into a swinging whole. Fueled by Mays' ostinato in the intro, Metheny's soloing winds around the outside, punctuating and stretching it as electronics paint the backdrop. The band locks into the groove before Maret and Vu add banners of expressionistic color. The Way Up feels more like a jazz concerto than anything else. If anything, it may actually be the record Metheny and Mays have been trying to make for over two decades. It is the place between the cracks, where defined genres disappear into a poetic whole and what emerges is something utterly new, guided and inspired by the limitless creativity of the jazz tradition.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

		"name": "Midnight Oil",
		"biography": "<p>Australia's Midnight Oil brought a new sense of political and social immediacy to pop music: not only did incendiary hits like ~Beds Are Burning~ and ~Blue Sky Mine~ bring global attention to the plight of, respectively, Australia's indigenous people and working class, but the group also put its money where its mouth was -- in addition to mounting benefit performances for groups like Greenpeace and Save the Whales, frontman Peter Garrett later became a member of the Australian House of Representatives on the Labor ticket.</p><p>The band formed in Sydney in 1971 as Farm, and originally comprised guitarists Jim Moginie and Martin Rotsey, drummer Rob Hirst, and bassist Andrew ~Bear~ James; Garrett, a law student known for his seven-foot-tall stature and shaven head, assumed vocal duties in 1975, and the group soon rechristened itself Midnight Oil. After months of sporadic gigs, they began making the rounds to area record companies; following a string of rejections, the group formed its own label, Powderworks, and issued its self-titled debut -- a taut, impassioned collection of guitar rock that quickly established the Midnight Oil sound -- in 1978.</p><p>After declaring their independence from the music industry, Midnight Oil grew increasingly active and outspoken in the political arena; after performing in opposition to uranium mining, they supported the Tibet Council before turning their attentions to the unfair practices of the local music industry, and formed their own booking agency in response to the monopoly exerted by area agents and promoters. With their 1979 sophomore effort, Head Injuries, the band scored its first hit single, ~Cold Cold Change,~ and earned a gold record. James left the band the following year due to health problems; with new bassist Peter Gifford, they cut the EP Bird Noises, another chart success.</p><p>With 1981's Place Without a Postcard (recorded with producer Glyn Johns), Midnight Oil achieved platinum status on the strength of the smash ~Armistice Day,~ which won the group an American deal with Columbia Records. Their follow-up, 1983's 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, spent over two years in the Australian Top 40; after 1984's Red Sails in the Sunset, Garrett made a run at the Australian Senate on the Nuclear Disarmament Party ticket, losing by only a narrow margin. Participation in the Artists United Against Apartheid project followed, leading directly into Midnight Oil's increased interest in the battles of Australia's indigenous population and a tour, dubbed ~Black Fella White Fella,~ with the Warumpi Band.</p>The plight of Indigenous Australians fueled much of 1987's Diesel and Dust, the Oils' breakthrough record; sparked by the hit single ~Beds Are Burning,~ the album reached the U.S. Top 20 and made the band a household name. After bassist Dwayne ~Bones~ Hillman (ex-Swingers) replaced Gifford, Midnight Oil returned with 1990's Blue Sky Mining, which they followed with a concert outside of the Exxon corporation's Manhattan offices in protest of the company's handling of the Alaskan oil spill. (A film of the performance titled Black Rain Falls was later released, with profits going to Greenpeace.) The album Earth and Sun and Moon appeared in 1993, followed three years later by Breathe. Midnight Oil next resurfaced in 1998 with Redneck Wonderland. The Real Thing, only available in Australia, followed in 2001. It was a solid collection of new songs and live tracks from Midnight Oil's magnificent run at the Metro Theatre in Sydney. Capricornia, issued on Liquid 8 in spring 2002, marked the band's 14th album of its career. In December, Peter Garrett announced his split from the band after 25 years. Garrett, who left Midnight Oil on good terms, decided to pursue politics full-time. In 2004, Garrett ran for the House of Representatives on the Labor ticket. He won the Kingsford Smith seat in New South Wales and was appointed as Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Reconciliation and the Arts in 2005. In 2007, Garrett was appointed as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts by Prime Minister-elect Kevin Rudd, and he continued to serve in various capacities until 2013, when he chose to conclude his political career. While Peter Garrett served in the Australian government, the other members of Midnight Oil pursued various musical projects. The most prominent of these was Ghostwriters, a band featuring drummer Rob Hirst and guitarist Martin Rotsey. In 2009, Midnight Oil reunited with Garrett for three concerts, culminating in a charity show for Sound Relief. In 2016, a few years after Garrett retired from politics, Midnight Oil announced via their website that they were exploring a possible live and studio reunion in 2017. <p>&mdash;<strong>Jason Ankeny</strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>Midnight Oil frontman Peter Garrett has long been active in elective politics in Australia, and like any good politician, he knows that sometimes the most important thing is to get your message out to the masses, even it means speaking with a bit less force than might be your custom. While the hard edges and challenging angles of 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and Red Sails in the Sunset made Midnight Oil bona fide superstars in Australia, they were little more than a rumor in most of the rest of the world, and for their sixth album, Diesel and Dust, Midnight Oil made some changes in their approach. On Diesel and Dust, there's less in the way of bruising hard rock like ~Best of Both Worlds,~ nothing as eccentric as ~Outside World,~ and very little as esoterically regional as ~Jimmy Sharman's Boxers,~ while the production favors the tuneful side of the band's songwriting (which, truth to tell, was always there) and buffs away some of the group's harsher edges. As a result, Diesel and Dust isn't an album for hardcore Oils fans, but as a bid for a larger audience, it was both shrewd and well executed -- it was the group's first real worldwide success, going platinum in America and spawning a massive hit single, ~Beds Are Burning.~</p><p>While the album lacks the kick-in-the-head impact of their earlier work, Diesel and Dust also makes clear that the bandmembers could apply their intelligence and passion to less aggressive material and still come up with forceful, compelling music, as on the haunting ~The Dead Heart~ and the poppy but emphatic ~Dreamworld.~ And as always, there was no compromise in the band's forceful political stance -- most of the album's songs deal openly with the issues of Aboriginal rights (hardly an issue pertinent only to Australians), and one of Midnight Oil's greatest victories may well be writing a song explicitly demanding reparations for indigenous peoples, and seeing it top the charts around the world. And the closer, ~Sometimes,~ may be the finest and most moving anthem the band ever wrote (~Sometimes you're beaten to the core/Sometimes you're taken to the wall/But you don't give in~). Diesel and Dust is that rarity, a bid for the larger audience that's also an artistic success and a triumph for leftist politics -- even the Clash never managed that hat trick this well.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>"

The Australian band had finally broken through with their previous record, Diesel and Dust, but chart accomplishments didn't temper the group. Blue Sky Mining found lead singer Peter Garrett and the boys singing about familiar themes with their usual passion. The songs aren't quite on par with those from Diesel and Dust, but there's still enough here to make it a worthy follow-up. The lead track ~Blue Sky Mine~ deals with the oppression of the lower working class within the context of a mining company. The immediately catchy cut managed to find mid-chart success. Other notable tracks are the driving ~Forgotten Years,~ which also managed a bit of airplay, and the menacing ~Mountains of Burma.~ The band stumble only once, on the clumsy love song ~Shakers and Movers.~</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Tom Demalon</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>With Midnight Oil's live album (Scream in Blue) and their first ~greatest-hits~ collection (20,000 Watt R.S.L.), it might seem strange to learn of the band releasing yet another concert album of past favorites. However, there are a few important distinctions. First, The Real Thing has four new songs straight from the studio. Second, all these live songs are from the band's more subtle acoustic performances. And third, it is one of the most definitive collections the band has ever recorded. ~The Dead Heart~ sounds utterly magnificent, injecting restrained aboriginal majesty into one of the band's most over-played songs. However, ~In the Valley~ (taken from the band's MTV Unplugged show) is the most telling: Completely subverted into a piano-led solo instead of the original's searing peaks, Peter Garrett vocalizes the loss of the recent death of a loved one with such vulnerability it is nothing less than astonishing. So with this in mind, are the new studio tracks even worthwhile or just distractions? Well, both ~Say Your Prayers~ and ~The Last of the Diggers~ retain the renewed vitriol of albums like Redneck Wonderland, yet more with the natural tones of Earth and Sun and Moon this time around. One may feel that The Real Thing as a whole might lack the sheer onslaught of a more varied, ~plugged~ Midnight Oil, but even an embittered listener would have to admit that the band is first and foremost a live group. Because to showcase such strengths in this enormously rewarding collection of acoustic live selections is a welcome open door for a casual listener as well as a blowing kiss to longtime, loyal fans.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Dean Carlson</strong></p>"

They're still as righteously indignant as ever over the plight of the common man, although perhaps not quite as direct or focused. There's plenty of fire in the belly, though, on driving cuts like ~Golden Age~ and the tempered optimism of ~World That I See,~ while they exhibit their trademark resilience on ~Tone Poem.~ From its lovely, stripped-down intro, ~Under the Overpass~ (about the homeless) builds to a powerful climax, providing one of the album's highlights, and they work up a good head of steam on the forceful ~Say Your Prayers~ (which, musically, is reminiscent of U2's ~Zoo Station~).

		"lastname": "Mitchell",
		"name": "Joni Mitchell",
		"biography": "<P>When the dust settles, Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century. Uncompromising and iconoclastic, Mitchell confounded expectations at every turn; restlessly innovative, her music evolved from deeply personal folk stylings into pop, jazz, avant-garde, and even world music, presaging the multicultural experimentation of the 1980s and 1990s by over a decade. Fiercely independent, her work steadfastly resisted the whims of both mainstream audiences and the male-dominated recording industry -- while Mitchell's records never sold in the same numbers enjoyed by contemporaries like Carole King, Janis Joplin, or Aretha Franklin, none experimented so recklessly with their artistic identities or so bravely explored territory outside of the accepted confines of pop music, resulting in a creative legacy which paved the way for performers ranging from Patti Smith and Chrissie Hynde to Madonna and Courtney Love.</P><P>Born Roberta Joan Anderson in Fort McLeod, Alberta, Canada, on November 7, 1943, she was stricken with polio at the age of nine; while recovering in a children's hospital, she began her performing career by singing to the other patients. After later teaching herself to play guitar with the aid of a Pete Seeger instruction book, she went off to art college, and became a fixture on the folk-music scene around Alberta. After relocating to Toronto, she married folksinger Chuck Mitchell in 1965, and began performing under the name Joni Mitchell.</P><P>A year later the couple moved to Detroit, MI, but separated soon after; Joni remained in the Motor City, however, and won significant press acclaim for her burgeoning songwriting skills and smoky, distinctive vocals, leading to a string of high-profile performances in New York City. There she became a cause célèbre among the media and other performers; after she signed to Reprise in 1967, David Crosby offered to produce her debut record, a self-titled acoustic effort that appeared the following year. Her songs also found great success with other singers: in 1968, Judy Collins scored a major hit with the Mitchell-penned ~Both Sides Now,~ while Fairport Convention covered ~Eastern Rain~ and Tom Rush recorded ~The Circle Game.~</P><P>Thanks to all of the outside exposure, Mitchell began to earn a strong cult following; her 1969 sophomore effort, Clouds, reached the Top 40, while 1970's Ladies of the Canyon sold even better on the strength of the single ~Big Yellow Taxi.~ It also included her anthemic composition ~Woodstock,~ a major hit for Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. Still, the commercial and critical approval awarded her landmark 1971 record Blue was unprecedented: a luminous, starkly confessional set written primarily during a European vacation, the album firmly established Mitchell as one of pop music's most remarkable and insightful talents.</P><P>Predictably, she turned away from Blue's incandescent folk with 1972's For the Roses, the first of the many major stylistic turns she would take over the course of her daring career. Backed by rock-jazz performer Tom Scott, Mitchell's music began moving into more pop-oriented territory, a change typified by the single ~You Turn Me On (I'm a Radio),~ her first significant hit. The follow-up, 1974's classic Court and Spark, was her most commercially successful outing: a sparkling, jazz-accented set, it reached the number two spot on the U.S. album charts and launched three hit singles -- ~Help Me,~ ~Free Man in Paris,~ and ~Raised on Robbery.~</P><P>After the 1974 live collection Miles of Aisles, Mitchell emerged in 1975 with The Hissing of Summer Lawns, a bold, almost avant-garde record that housed her increasingly complex songs in experimental, jazz-inspired settings; ~The Jungle Line~ introduced the rhythms of African Burundi drums, placing her far ahead of the pop world's mid-'80s fascination with world music. 1976's Hejira, recorded with Weather Report bassist Jaco Pastorius, smoothed out the music's more difficult edges while employing minimalist techniques; Mitchell later performed the album's first single, ~Coyote,~ at the Band's Last Waltz concert that Thanksgiving.</P><P>Her next effort, 1977's two-record set Don Juan's Reckless Daughter, was another ambitious move, a collection of long, largely improvisational pieces recorded with jazz players Larry Carlton and Wayne Shorter, Chaka Khan, and a battery of Latin percussionists. Shortly after the record's release, Mitchell was contacted by the legendary jazz bassist Charles Mingus, who invited her to work with him on a musical interpretation of T.S. Eliot's Four Quartets. Mingus, who was suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, sketched out a series of melodies to which Mitchell added lyrics; however, Mingus died on January 5, 1979, before the record was completed. After Mitchell finished their collaboration on her own, she recorded the songs under the title Mingus, which was released the summer after the jazz titan's passing.</P><P>Following her second live collection, 1980's Shadows and Light, Mitchell returned to pop territory for 1982's Wild Things Run Fast; the first single, a cover of the Elvis Presley hit ~(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care,~ became her first chart single in eight years. Shortly after the album's release, she married bassist/sound engineer Larry Klein, who became a frequent collaborator on much of her subsequent material, including 1985's synth-driven Dog Eat Dog, co-produced by Thomas Dolby. Mitchell's move into electronics continued with 1988's Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm, featuring guests Peter Gabriel, Willie Nelson, Tom Petty, and Billy Idol.</P><P>Mitchell returned to her roots with 1991's Night Ride Home, a spare, stripped-down collection spotlighting little more than her voice and acoustic guitar. Prior to recording 1994's Turbulent Indigo, she and Klein separated, although he still co-produced the record, which was her most acclaimed work in years. In 1996, she compiled a pair of anthologies, Hits and Misses, which collected her chart successes as well as underappreciated favorites. A new studio album, Taming the Tiger, followed in 1998. Both Sides Now, a collection of standards, followed in early 2000.</P><P>Two years later, Mitchell resurfaced with the double-disc release Travelogue. She said this was her last album ever, for she announced in October 2002 that she had grown tired of the industry.</P><P>She told W magazine that she intended to retire. She also claimed she would never sign another corporate label deal and in Rolling Stone blasted the recording industry for being ~a cesspool.~ By the time Travelogue appeared a month later, Mitchell had simmered down and her plans to call it quits had been axed.</P><P>— <B>Jason Ankeny</B> </P>",

				"review": "<p>In the months prior to the passing of legendary jazz bassist Charles Mingus, Joni Mitchell had been personally summoned by the bop pioneer to collaborate on a musical version of T.S. Eliot's Four Quartets. The project would entail Mitchell to condense the text for Mingus to score instrumentally. He planned on utilizing a full orchestra, as well as the more traditional guitar and bass. They would accompany Mitchell's vocals and the narration of selected portions of the text. After a few weeks of consideration, Mitchell's reaction was that ~[she]'d rather condense the bible.~ Mingus then bestowed Mitchell with six melodies -- ~Joni I~ through ~Joni VI~ -- penned specifically for her. Mitchell spent a few weeks with Mingus -- who was totally immobilized from amyotropic lateral sclerosis (aka Lou Gehrig's Disease) -- during the spring of 1978. Their partnership advanced the half-dozen tunes. More importantly, it shook Mitchell from a three-month long writer's block/drought -- yielding two of her best late-'70s compositions: ~God Must Be a Boogie Man~ and the revisitation and completion of a track she'd been wood-shedding, now titled ~The Wolf That Lives in Lindsey.~ Incidentally, the former piece was inspired by the opening chapters of Mingus' autobiography, Beneath the Underdog. Initial recordings during Mitchell's stay with Mingus in New York City produced several interesting experimental sessions with the likes of Stanley Clarke (bass), Jan Hammer (keyboards), John McLaughlin (guitar), Gerry Mulligan (baritone sax), and Tony Williams (drums). A few of these recordings -- while rumored to have been lost, destroyed, or made otherwise unavailable -- were leaked into the trading community in the late '90s. Arguably, Mitchell could not have chosen any finer musicians than the sextet she ultimately incorporated into this work. The luminaries include Herbie Hancock (electric piano), Wayne Shorter (soprano sax), Jaco Pastorious (bass/horn arrangements), Peter Erskine (drums), Don Alias (congas), and Emil Richards (percussion). Sprinkled amongst these soulfully jazzy pieces are five ~raps,~ or aural snapshots of the time Mitchell and Mingus spent together. Sadly, Charles Mingus passed before he was able to listen to this timeless and ageless paean to his remarkable contributions to bop and free jazz.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Shadows and Light is Joni Mitchell's second live album, and it serves as a good retrospective of her jazzy period from 1975-1979. As expected, she assembles a group of all-star musicians including Pat Metheny (guitar), Jaco Pastorius (bass), Lyle Mays (keyboards), and Michael Brecker (saxophone) who give these compositions more energy than on the studio recordings. The musicians are given room to jam, and they sound terrific on uptempo songs such as ~Coyote~ and ~In France They Kiss on Main Street.~ If there is a general theme of these songs, it's about growing older and maturing after the failed idealism of the late '60s (the album opens with audio clips from the movie Rebel Without a Cause). Although this album is pleasing, the live arrangements are not different enough from the studio versions to warrant higher marks. In fact, Mitchell has always been an album artist who recorded studio albums that had a sound and feel all their own. While Shadows and Light provides a nice summary of her experimental period for casual fans, interested listeners should start with Hejira or The Hissing of Summer Lawns.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Vik Iyengar</strong></p>"

In the brief opener, ~Sunny Sunday,~ a woman tries to shoot out a streetlight with a pistol and misses every night, a metaphor for the individual's futile struggle against civilization, and Mitchell repeats much the same message in songs like ~Sex Kills,~ a generalized criticism of everything from lawyers to the hole in the ozone layer; ~Turbulent Indigo,~ which describes the inability of people to understand artists; ~Last Chance Lost,~ which treats romantic disappointment; and ~Not to Blame,~ about spousal abuse. The low-key music and restrained vocals stand in contrast to the lyrics -- over and over, Mitchell's imagery refers to guns and violence. Turbulent Indigo provides a disturbing view of modern life made all the more compelling by its calm presentation.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong</p>>"

		"lastname": "Monk",
		"name": "Thelonius Monk",
		"biography": "<p>The most important jazz musicians are the ones who are successful in creating their own original world of music with its own rules, logic, and surprises. Thelonious Monk, who was criticized by observers who failed to listen to his music on its own terms, suffered through a decade of neglect before he was suddenly acclaimed as a genius; his music had not changed one bit in the interim. In fact, one of the more remarkable aspects of Monk's music was that it was fully formed by 1947 and he saw no need to alter his playing or compositional style in the slightest during the next 25 years.</p><p>Thelonious Monk grew up in New York, started playing piano when he was around five, and had his first job touring as an accompanist to an evangelist. He was inspired by the Harlem stride pianists (James P. Johnson was a neighbor) and vestiges of that idiom can be heard in his later unaccompanied solos. However, when he was playing in the house band of Minton's Playhouse during 1940-1943, Monk was searching for his own individual style. Private recordings from the period find him sometimes resembling Teddy Wilson but starting to use more advanced rhythms and harmonies. He worked with Lucky Millinder a bit in 1942 and was with the Cootie Williams Orchestra briefly in 1944 (Williams recorded Monk's ~Epistrophy~ in 1942 and in 1944 was the first to record ~'Round Midnight~), but it was when he became Coleman Hawkins' regular pianist that Monk was initially noticed. He cut a few titles with Hawkins (his recording debut) and, although some of Hawkins' fans complained about the eccentric pianist, the veteran tenor could sense the pianist's greatness.</p><p>The 1945-1954 period was very difficult for Thelonious Monk. Because he left a lot of space in his rhythmic solos and had an unusual technique, many people thought that he was an inferior pianist. His compositions were so advanced that the lazier bebop players (although not Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker) assumed that he was crazy. And Thelonious Monk's name, appearance (he liked funny hats), and personality (an occasionally uncommunicative introvert) helped to brand him as some kind of nut. Fortunately, Alfred Lion of Blue Note believed in him and recorded Monk extensively during 1947-1948 and 1951-1952. He also recorded for Prestige during 1952-1954, had a solo set for Vogue in 1954 during a visit to Paris, and appeared on a Verve date with Bird and Diz. But work was very sporadic during this era and Monk had to struggle to make ends meet.</p><p>His fortunes slowly began to improve. In 1955, he signed with Riverside and producer Orrin Keepnews persuaded him to record an album of Duke Ellington tunes and one of standards so his music would appear to be more accessible to the average jazz fan. In 1956 came the classic <i>Brilliant Corners</i> album, but it was the following year when the situation permanently changed. Monk was booked into the Five Spot for a long engagement and he used a quartet that featured tenor saxophonist John Coltrane. Finally, the critics and then the jazz public recognized Thelonious Monk's greatness during this important gig. The fact that he was unique was a disadvantage a few years earlier when all modern jazz pianists were expected to sound like Bud Powell (who was ironically a close friend), but by 1957 the jazz public was looking for a new approach. Suddenly, Monk was a celebrity and his status would not change for the remainder of his career. In 1958, his quartet featured the tenor of Johnny Griffin (who was even more compatible than Coltrane), in 1959 he appeared with an orchestra at Town Hall (with arrangements by Hall Overton), in 1962 he signed with Columbia and two years later was on the cover of Time. A second orchestra concert in 1963 was even better than the first and Monk toured constantly throughout the 1960s with his quartet which featured the reliable tenor of Charlie Rouse. He played with the Giants of Jazz during 1971-1972, but then in 1973 suddenly retired. Monk was suffering from mental illness and, other than a few special appearances during the mid-'70s, he lived the rest of his life in seclusion. After his death it seemed as if everyone was doing Thelonious Monk tributes. There were so many versions of ~'Round Midnight~ that it was practically a pop hit! But despite the posthumous acclaim and attempts by pianists ranging from Marcus Roberts to Tommy Flanagan to recreate his style, there was no replacement for the original.</p><p>Some of Thelonious Monk's songs became standards early on, most notably ~'Round Midnight,~ ~Straight No Chaser,~ ~52nd Street Theme,~ and ~Blue Monk.~ Many of his other compositions have by now been figured out by other jazz musicians and are occasionally performed including ~Ruby My Dear,~ ~Well You Needn't,~ ~Off Minor,~ ~In Walked Bud,~ ~Misterioso,~ ~Epistrophy,~ ~I Mean You,~ ~Four in One,~ ~Criss Cross,~ ~Ask Me Now,~ ~Little Rootie Tootie,~ ~Monk's Dream,~ ~Bemsha Swing,~ ~Think of One,~ ~Friday the 13th,~ ~Hackensack,~ ~Nutty,~ ~Brilliant Corners,~ ~Crepuscule With Nellie~ (written for his strong and supportive wife), ~Evidence,~ and ~Rhythm-a-Ning,~ Virtually all of Monk's recordings (for Blue Note, Prestige, Vogue, Riverside, Columbia, and Black Lion) have been reissued and among his sidemen through the years were Idrees Sulieman, Art Blakey, Milt Jackson, Lou Donaldson, Lucky Thompson, Max Roach, Julius Watkins, Sonny Rollins, Clark Terry, Gerry Mulligan, John Coltrane, Wilbur Ware, Shadow Wilson, Johnny Griffin, Donald Byrd, Phil Woods, Thad Jones, and Charlie Rouse. His son Thelonious Monk, Jr. (T.S. Monk) has helped keep the hard bop tradition alive with his quintet and has headed the Thelonious Monk Institute, whose yearly competitions succeed in publicizing talented young players.</p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b>",

In addition to embracing the bright moments from Monk's early- to mid-'60s studio and live releases, compilation producer Orrin Keepnews -- Thelonious' original recording producer during his formidable tenure on the Riverside label -- has included several restored performances and a few previously unissued pieces as well. <i>The Columbia Years: 1962-1968</i> is subdivided into ~studio~ and ~live~ performances with each musical configuration represented. These include Monk as a soloist, in a trio, a quartet, and in a big-band context. These varied settings further augment Thelonious Monk as not only an instinctual presence on the keyboard, but as a craftsman of timeless melody, harmony, and rhythmic counterpoint. ~Think of One,~ ~Blue Monk,~ and a solo ~Don't Blame Me~ are among the newly mined treasures exclusive to <i>The Columbia Years: 1962-1968</i>. As one might presume, there are no icon-shattering discoveries among the restorations or debut releases. In their stead is a resurrection of the brilliant sound lost on previous cassette and poorly mastered CD releases. Particularly notable are the live tracks with their tangible electric vibe. ~Straight, No Chaser~ -- taken from the September 1964 Monterey Jazz Festival -- draws the listener into its confidence with satisfying crispness and warmth. Likewise, ~Evidence~ and ~Epistrophy~ -- taken from the soundtrack of the award-winning documentary film Straight, No Chaser -- no longer sound out of phase. In fact, the contrary would be more accurate. The conclusion of Thelonious Monk's brilliant recording career is lovingly captured on this box set. His inventive wisdom and candid spirit shine through every note.</p>&mdash; <b>Lindsay Planer</b>"

		"name": "Gary Moore",
		"biography": "<p>One of rock's most underrated guitarists (both from a technical and compositional point of view), Gary Moore remains relatively unknown in the U.S., while his solo work has brought him substantial acclaim and commercial success in most other parts of the world -- especially in Europe. Born on April 4, 1952, in Belfast, Ireland, Moore became interested in guitar during the '60s, upon discovering such blues-rock masters as Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and perhaps his biggest influence of all, Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green. After relocating to Dublin later in the decade, Moore joined a local rock group called Skid Row, which featured a young singer by the name of Phil Lynott, who would soon after leave the group to double up on bass and form Thin Lizzy. Skid Row persevered, however, eventually opening a show for Moore's heroes, Peter Green and Fleetwood Mac, and making such an impression on the veteran group that Green personally requested their manager help secure Skid Row a recording contract with CBS (in addition, Green sold Moore one of his most-used guitars, a maple 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard, which would become Moore's primary instrument).</p><p>Skid Row would go on to issue several singles and albums (including 1970's Skid and 1971's 34 Hours), and although the group mounted a few tours of Europe and the U.S., it failed to obtain breakthrough commercial success, leading to Moore's exit from the group in 1972. Moore then formed his own outfit, the Gary Moore Band (along with members drummer Pearse Kelly and bassist John Curtis), for which the guitarist also served as vocalist. But after the trio's debut album, 1973's Grinding Stone, sunk without a trace, Moore hooked up once more with ex-bandmate Lynott in Thin Lizzy. Moore's initial tenure in Lizzy proved to be short-lived, however, as his fiery playing was featured on only a handful of tracks. Moore then set his sights on studio work (appearing on Eddie Howell's 1975 release, Gramaphone Record), before joining up with a prog rock/fusion outfit, Colosseum II. But once more, Moore's tenure in his latest outfit was fleeting; he appeared on only three recordings (1976's Strange New Flesh, plus a pair in 1977, Electric Savage and War Dance), as Moore accepted an invitation by his old buddy Lynott to fill in for a Thin Lizzy U.S. tour, playing arenas opening for Queen.</p><p>Moore proved to be quite busy in 1978, as the guitarist appeared on three other artists' recordings -- Andrew Lloyd Webber's Variations, Rod Argent's Moving Home, and Gary Boyle's Electric Glide. The same year, Moore issued his second solo release (almost five years after his solo debut), Back on the Streets, which spawned a surprise Top Ten U.K. hit in May of 1979, the bluesy ballad ~Parisienne Walkways,~ and featured vocal contributions by Lynott. Moore joined forces with his Lizzy mates once more in 1979, appearing on arguably the finest studio album of their career, Black Rose, which proved to be a huge hit in the U.K. (for a fine example of Moore's exceptional guitar skills, check out the album's epic title track). But predictably, Moore ultimately exited the group once more (this time right in the middle of a U.S. tour), as a rift had developed between Moore and Lynott. Undeterred, Moore lent some guitar work to drummer Cozy Powell's solo release, Over the Top, in addition to forming a new outfit, G Force, which would only remain together for a lone self-titled release in 1980.</p><p>During the early '80s, Moore united with former ELP guitarist/bassist/singer Greg Lake, appearing on a pair of Lake solo releases (1981's self-titled release and 1983's Manoeuvres), in addition to guesting on another Cozy Powell solo release, Octopuss. But it was also during the '80s that Moore finally got serious with his solo career -- issuing such heavy metal-based works as 1982's Corridors of Power, 1983's Victims of the Future, 1984's Dirty Fingers and the in-concert set We Want Moore!, 1985's Run for Cover, 1987's Wild Frontier, plus 1989's After the War -- establishing a large following in Europe, despite remaining virtually unknown stateside. The decade wasn't all rosy for Moore, however -- although he was able to patch up his friendship with Phil Lynott (appearing with Lizzy for several tracks on Life/Live, and teaming with Lynott for a pair of tracks in 1985, ~Military Man~ and ~Out in the Fields,~ the latter a U.K. hit), years of hard living finally caught up with Lynott, leading to his passing in January of 1986. Moore would subsequently dedicate ~Wild Frontier~ to Lynott, and honored Thin Lizzy's former frontman on the track ~Blood of Emeralds~ (from After the War).</p><p>Fed up with the pressure to pen hit singles and tired of his metallic musical direction, Moore returned to his blues roots for 1990's Still Got the Blues, the most renowned and best-selling release of his career, as the album featured such special guests as Albert Collins, Albert King, and George Harrison. Moore continued in his newly rediscovered blues style on such subsequent releases as 1992's After Hours and 1993's Blues Alive, before forming the short-lived supergroup BBM along with Cream's former rhythm section -- bassist Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger Baker -- which lasted for a single album, 1994's Around the Next Dream. Up next for Moore was a tribute album for Peter Green, 1995's Blues for Greeny, which saw him put his own personal stamp on 11 tracks either penned or performed at some point by Green. Moore experimented with different musical styles on his next two solo releases, 1997's Dark Days in Paradise and 1999's A Different Beat, before embracing the blues once more on his first release of the 21st century, 2001's Back to the Blues.</p><p>Over the years, Gary Moore has been the subject of countless compilations, the best of the bunch being 1998's metal-oriented Collection and 2002's blues-based Best of the Blues, as well as Out in the Fields: The Very Best of Gary Moore, which was split 50/50 between his metal and blues excursions. Teaming with Skunk Anansie bassist Cass Lewis and Primal Fear drummer Darrin Mooney, Moore started work on much harder and alternative-influenced rock in the spring of 2002 and released the results as Scars. The powerful Live at Monsters of Rock from 2003 proudly declared ~no overdubs used~ while 2004's raw Power of the Blues featured nothing but the blues.</p>&mdash; <b>Greg Prato</b>",

				"review": "<p>After a brief return to his hard rock roots in 2002's Scars, guitarist Gary Moore comes back to the blues where his heart seems to be. But really, Moore's forte is his knack of combining the meaty licks and rugged tone from his gutsy rock to energize the electric blues music he has embraced since 1990's Still Got the Blues. To that end, Scars' drummer Darrin Mooney returns and Bob Daisley, veteran of such thundering outfits as Ozzy Osbourne's band, Uriah Heep and Rainbow, joins on bass. Hence this album's title is appropriate, since the power trio format pounds out this music with clenched-fist authority. Moore is an exceptionally tasty musician but even when the amps are turned up to eleven, as they are for most of this disc, there is feeling in his fiery licks. The originals that dominate are little more than rewritten established blues riffs and his songs are predominantly vehicles for his explosive, wah-wah-heavy attacks. Covers of Willie Dixon's ~Evil~ and ~I Can't Quit You Baby~ don't take the tunes anywhere they haven't been before (the latter copies Led Zeppelin's version almost down to the note) but Moore wrings enough guts out of them to make his renderings well-worth hearing, if not essential. A crawling take on Percy Mayfield's ~Memory Pain~ drags the standard on to Moore's playing field, but maintains the original's sense of sorrow. The guitarist's understated imprint is also evident on ballads like ~That's Why I Play the Blues~ where his low-key vocals and lighter touch are surprisingly poignant. He seems to be having a ball throughout, singing and playing with the loose authority that only 35 years as a professional musician allows. Moore is especially convincing and enthusiastic on the jazzy, walking bass propelled ~Can't Find My Baby,~ a nice change-up from the album's predominantly charging tone. The creeping menace of the closing ~Torn Inside~ also shows how Moore uses subtle dynamics and a less-is-more tactic borrowed from his mentor Peter Green, to ramp up the drama. There's nothing here Moore hasn't done previously, but it's another stellar entry into his bulging catalog and a great place for hard rock fans to jump aboard the blues train.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Hal Horowitz</strong></p>"

And Moore positively burns throughout Blues for Greeny, tearing off licks with ferocious intensity.

				"review": "<p>Six years after his successful tribute to Peter Green, Gary Moore follows with another solid electric blues-rock effort that falls squarely in line with his similarly themed albums Still Got the Blues, After Hours, and Blues Alive. Although he adds brass on a rollicking version of B.B. King's ~You Upset Me Baby,~ Moore predominantly sticks to the basics here, pounding out energetic and full-bodied blues-rock and leading a stripped-down trio with a journeyman's enthusiasm and his trademark thick, sustained guitar solos slashing through the proceedings. The majority of the tracks are originals, although even the best of them sound suspiciously like rewritten blues standards. ~Cold Black Night~ is little more than a speeded-up ~Messin' With the Kid,~ and ~Picture of the Moon~ sounds awfully similar to Moore's own ~Still Got the Blues.~ And whether the world needs yet another version of ~Stormy Monday~ or ~I Ain't Got You~ is debatable. But Moore pulls off even the most clichéd material with his phenomenal prowess; supple, identifiable vocals; and a guitar tone that effortlessly shifts from a Santana/Peter Green-styled hovering intensity to a slashing Stevie Ray Vaughan attack. While Moore isn't redefining the genre or even his own approach to it, he's adding his stamp to blues-rock with Back to the Blues. Consistently rugged, moving, and heartfelt, the album is a reminder that even without reinventing an established musical style, an artist can effectively work within its boundaries to produce a satisfying, if not quite fresh, interpretation relying solely on talent and passion.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Hal Horowitz</strong></p>"

Old New Ballads Blues is exactly what the title says it is, a mix of old blues (covers of songs by Elmore James, Willie Dixon, and Otis Rush), new blues (five Moore originals), ballads (half the album) and, well, blues (by one definition or another, everything here passes for blues). The real surprise is that the strongest songs are the original Moore-penned ballads, as Moore gives powerful and atmospheric performances (both vocally and as a guitarist) on ~Gonna Rain Today,~ ~No Reason to Cry,~ and a solid horn-augmented remake of one of his best songs, ~Midnight Blues,~ from what is easily his best album, 1990s million-selling Still Got the Blues. The James and Dixon covers (~Done Something Wrong~ and ~You Know My Love~ respectively) seem disappointingly by-the-numbers, while the Rush song, ~All Your Love,~ fares a bit better, but Moore's own compositions shine brightest here, giving him plenty of room to weep on the old Les Paul, which is a very good thing, since vocals have never been Moore's strongest suit and his lyrics are often on the slight side. All of that vanishes when his guitar takes over a song, and on the instrumental ~Cut It Out,~ Moore's muscular guitar tone says as much or more about life inside the blues as any of the vocal numbers.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Steve Leggett</strong></p>"

		"name": "Van Morrison",
		"biography": "<div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/vm-astral-weeks.jpg~ alt=~Astral Weeks~/><p>Equal parts blue-eyed soul shouter and wild-eyed poet-sorcerer, Van Morrison is among popular music's true innovators, a restless seeker whose incantatory vocals and alchemical fusion of R&B, jazz, blues, and Celtic folk produced what is regarded as perhaps the most spiritually transcendent body of work in the rock & roll canon. Having penned iconic songs such as ~Gloria,~ ~Brown-Eyed Girl,~ and ~Moondance,~ Morrison has, from the very beginning -- as frontman for Irish blues rockers Them during the early 1960s to a solo career that has lasted more than 50 years -- been subject only to the whims of his own muse. His solo recordings, beginning with the mystical, jazzy folk of Astral Weeks in 1968, cover extraordinary stylistic ground, yet retain a consistency of vision and purity of execution unmatched among his contemporaries. His swinging meld of jazz, pop, folk, blues, and Celtic soul fueled the albums of his Warner Bros. period from the late '60s (Moondance) to the early '80s (Common One). From the late '80s through the end of the century with Mercury, he connected the spiritual power of his musical vision to a re-engagement with his Belfast roots on Irish Heartbeat (accompanied by the Chieftains) and to the blues wails and gospel whispers of his youth on Too Long in Exile, Healing Game, and Back on Top. During the 21st century, his recordings underscored his indelible singing style that bypasses the confines of language to articulate emotional truths far beyond the scope of literal meaning, whether recording pop (Magic Time), country (Pay the Devil), Celtic R&B (Keep Me Singing), or fingerpopping jazz (You're Driving Me Crazy, with Joey DeFrancesco).</p><p>George Ivan Morrison was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on August 31, 1945; his mother was a singer, while his father ardently collected classic American jazz and blues recordings. At 15, he quit school to join the local R&B band the Monarchs, touring military bases throughout Europe before returning home to form his own group, Them. Boasting a fiery, gritty sound heavily influenced by Morrison heroes like Howlin' Wolf, Brownie McGhee, Sonny Boy Williamson, and Little Walter, Them quickly earned a devout local following, and in late 1964 recorded their debut single, ~Don't Start Crying Now.~ The follow-up, an electrifying reading of Big Joe Williams' ~Baby Please Don't Go,~ cracked the U.K. Top Ten in early 1965. Though not a major hit upon its original release, Them's Morrison-penned ~Gloria~ endures among the true classics of the rock pantheon, covered by everyone from the Doors to Patti Smith. Lineup changes plagued the band throughout its lifespan, however, and at the insistence of producer Bert Berns, session musicians increasingly assumed the lion's share of recording duties. A frustrated Morrison finally left Them following a 1966 tour of the U.S., quitting the music business and returning to Belfast.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/vm-blowin.jpg~ alt=~Blowin' Your Mind!~/><p>After Berns relocated to New York City to form Bang Records, he convinced Morrison to travel stateside and record as a solo artist; the sessions produced arguably his most familiar hit, the jubilant ~Brown-Eyed Girl~ (originally titled ~Brown-Skinned Girl~), a Top Ten smash in the summer of 1967. By contrast, however, the resulting album, Blowin' Your Mind, was a bleak, bluesy effort highlighted by the harrowing ~T.B. Sheets.~ The sessions were originally intended to produce only material for singles, so when Berns released the LP against Morrison's wishes, he again retreated home to Ireland while the album tanked on the charts. Berns suffered a fatal heart attack in late 1967, which freed Morrison of his contractual obligations and energized him to start working on new material.</p><p>His first album for new label Warner Bros., 1968's Astral Weeks, remains not only Morrison's masterpiece, but one of the greatest records ever made. A haunting, deeply personal collection of impressionistic folk-styled epics recorded by an all-star jazz backing unit including bassist Richard Davis and drummer Connie Kay, its poetic complexity earned critical raves but made only a minimal commercial impact. The follow-up, 1970's Moondance, was every bit as brilliant; buoyant and optimistic where Astral Weeks had been dark and anguished, it cracked the Top 40, generating the perennials ~Caravan~ and ~Into the Mystic.~</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/vm-his-band.jpg~ alt=~His Band and the Street Choir~/><p>The first half of the '70s was the most fertile creative period of Morrison's career. From Moondance onward, his records reflected an increasingly celebratory and profoundly mystical outlook spurred on in large part by his marriage to wife Janet Planet and the couple's relocation to California. After His Band and the Street Choir yielded his biggest chart hit, ~Domino,~ Morrison released 1971's Tupelo Honey, a lovely, pastoral meditation on wedded bliss highlighted by the single ~Wild Night.~ In the wake of the following year's stirring Saint Dominic's Preview, he formed the Caledonia Soul Orchestra, featured both on the studio effort Hard Nose the Highway and on the excellent live set It's Too Late to Stop Now. However, in 1973, he not only dissolved the group but also divorced Planet and moved back to Belfast. The stunning 1974 LP Veedon Fleece chronicled Morrison's emotional turmoil; he then remained silent for three years, reportedly working on a number of aborted projects but releasing nothing until 1977's aptly titled A Period of Transition.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/vm-wavelength.jpg~ alt=~Wavelength~/><p>Plagued for some time by chronic stage fright, Morrison mounted his first tour in close to five years in support of 1978's Wavelength; his performances became more and more erratic, however, and during a 1979 date at New York's Palladium, he even stalked off-stage in mid-set and did not return. Into the Music, released later that year, evoked a more conventionally spiritual perspective than before, a pattern continued on successive outings for years to come. Albums like 1983's Inarticulate Speech of the Heart, 1985's A Sense of Wonder, and 1986's No Guru, No Method, No Teacher are all largely cut from the same cloth, employing serenely beautiful musical backdrops to explore themes of faith and healing. For 1988's Irish Heartbeat, however, Morrison teamed with another of his homeland's musical institutions, the famed Chieftains, for a collection of traditional folk songs.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/vm-avalon-sunset.jpg~ alt=~Avalon Sunset~/><p>Meanwhile, Avalon Sunset heralded a commercial rebirth of sorts in 1989. While ~Whenever God Shines His Light,~ a duet with Cliff Richard, became Morrison's first U.K. Top 20 hit in over two decades, the gorgeous ~Have I Told You Lately That I Love You~ emerged as something of a contemporary standard, with a Rod Stewart cover cracking the U.S. Top Five in 1993. Further proof of Morrison's renewed popularity arrived with the 1990 release of Mercury's best-of package; far and away the best-selling album of his career, it introduced the singer to a new generation of fans. A new studio record, Enlightenment, appeared that same year, followed in 1991 by the ambitious double set Hymns to the Silence, widely hailed as his most impressive outing in years.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/vm-days-like-this.jpg~ alt=~Days Like This~/><p>Following the uniformity of his '80s work, the remainder of the decade proved impressively eclectic: 1993's Too Long in Exile returned Morrison to his musical roots with covers of blues and R&B classics, while on 1995's Days Like This he teamed with daughter Shana for a duet on ~You Don't Know Me.~ For the Verve label, he cut 1996's How Long Has This Been Going On, a traditional jazz record co-credited to longtime pianist Georgie Fame, and for the follow-up, Tell Me Something: The Songs of Mose Allison, he worked with guest of honor Allison himself. Morrison continued balancing the past and the future in the years to come, alternating between new studio albums (1997's The Healing Game, 1999's Back on Top) and collections of rare and live material (1998's The Philosopher's Stone and 2000's The Skiffle Sessions and You Win Again).</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/vm-down-the-road.jpg~ alt=~Down the Road~/><p>It wasn't until 2002 that an album of new material surfaced, but in May, his long-anticipated Down the Road was released. Three years later, Morrison issued Magic Time. Pay the Devil, a country-tinged set, appeared in 2006 on Lost Highway Records. That same year, Morrison released his first commercial DVD, Live at Montreux 1980 and 1974, drawn from two separate appearances at the Montreux Jazz Festival. In 2008, Morrison released Keep It Simple, his first album of all-original material since 1999's Back on Top. In November of that same year, Morrison performed the entire Astral Weeks album live at two shows at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, which resulted in 2009's Astral Weeks: Live at the Hollywood Bowl album and Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl: The Concert Film. His 34th studio album, Born to Sing: No Plan B, recorded in Belfast, appeared in the fall of 2012. In 2015, Morrison made his debut for RCA Records with Duets: Re-Working the Catalogue, which found him sharing the mike on 16 songs with artists such as Michael Bublé, Steve Winwood, Mick Hucknall, and Joss Stone. After signing a deal with Sony Legacy to reissue much of his back catalog, the label issued It's Too Late to Stop Now...Vols. II, III, IV and DVD in June 2016. It consisted of unreleased music from the tour that produced the classic 1973 live album. Later that month, Morrison announced the release of an album of new studio set material. Released in September, Keep Me Singing offered 12 originals as well a cover version of Don Robey's ~Share Your Love with Me.~ A year later, in September 2017, Morrison returned with his 37th album, Roll with the Punches, which saw him mixing new originals with renditions of blues and soul classics that inspired him, from Sam Cooke and Bo Diddley to Little Walter and more. Guitarist Jeff Beck was a prominent guest. It peaked at number five on the Top 200 and number four in the U.K. He followed it less than three months later in December with Versatile, which was recorded in a handful of hotels in County Down. It featured Morrison delivering his own homage to jazz and iconic pop standards including George and Ira Gershwin's ~A Foggy Day~ and ~They Can't Take That Away from Me,~ Cole Porter's ~I Get a Kick Out of You~ (one of two advance singles along with ~Makin' Whoopee~), ~Let's Get Lost,~ ~I Left My Heart in San Francisco,~ and ~Unchained Melody,~ popularized by the Righteous Brothers. The covers are interspersed with six originals and it topped the jazz album charts and the album remained in the Top Ten for five months. Morrison hit the road with a vengeance. He performed completely sold-out tours across Europe and North America. In April 2018, Morrison issued his 39th album (and fourth in a year-and-a-half) in collaboration with Hammond B-3 and trumpet ace Joey De Francesco and his quartet (drummer Michael Ode, guitarist Dan Wilson, and tenor sax man Troy Roberts). Recorded over just a few days in San Francisco, the set includes jazz and blues standards and reworked jazz versions of a number of songs from Morrison's catalog including ~Travellin' Light,~ ~Every Day I Have the Blues,~ ~Miss Otis Regrets,~ and ~The Things I Used to Do.~ These are juxtaposed with completely revisioned tracks from Morrison's catalog including ~All Saints Day,~ ~The Way Young Lovers Do,~ ~Have I Told You Lately,~ and ~Celtic Swing.~ A week after its release, the album entered the jazz charts in the top spot and remained in the Top Ten for nearly 22 weeks while the group toured the globe. In December, Morrison released his 40th album, The Prophet Speaks. Comprised of six new originals and covers of blues and soul classics from John Lee Hooker, Eddie ~Cleanhead~ Vinson, Sam Cooke, Solomon Burke, and Willie Dixon, the set was once again recorded with De Francesco's quartet. The following year, Morrison's reissue campaign continued with a triple-disc deluxe version of 1997's The Healing Game. That fall, Morrison released Three Chords and the Truth, a self-produced 14-track offering that included a duet with Bill Medley, the surviving half of '60s white-soul legends the Righteous Brothers, and included jazz guitarist Jay Berliner (the soloist on Astral Weeks). The set also included the song ~If We Wait for Mountains,~ a collaboration with legendary Irish lyricist (and fellow O.B.E. honoree) Don Black.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Jason Ankeny</strong></p>",

For all that renown, Astral Weeks is anything but an archetypal rock & roll album: in fact, it isn't a rock & roll album at all. Employing a mixture of folk, blues, jazz, and classical music, Van Morrison spins out a series of extended ruminations on his Belfast upbringing, including the remarkable character ~Madame George~ and the climactic epiphany experienced on ~Cyprus Avenue.~ Accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, Morrison sings in his elastic, bluesy voice, accompanied by a jazz rhythm section (Jay Berliner, guitar, Richard Davis, bass, Connie Kay, drums), plus reeds (John Payne) and vibes (Warren Smith, Jr.), with a string quartet overdubbed. An emotional outpouring cast in delicate musical structures, Astral Weeks has a unique musical power. Unlike any record before or since, it nevertheless encompasses the passion and tenderness that have always mixed in the best postwar popular music, easily justifying the critics' raves.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Payin' Dues was the first album to combine the previously released recordings Morrison made for Bang Records at the start of his solo career (some of which were issued initially on the album Blowin' Your Mind! in 1967, including the Top Ten hit ~Brown Eyed Girl~) with a bizarre collection of off-the-cuff musical performances Morrison made, strumming an acoustic guitar and seemingly singing whatever came into his head, apparently in order to fulfill the terms of his Bang contract. Early on in this one-of-a-kind improvisation, credited as a 35-plus-minute ~Jamming Session~ on the album cover, but actually broken down into individual tracks on the second disc, Morrison seems to be trying at least half-heartedly to come up with songs, but by the 14th fragment he has started singing about how he's waiting for his royalty check. After that, things get really strange. Twenty-two tracks in, he is giving his own potted history of his career on Bang, derisively referring to his album, with its psychedelic cover, as ~Blowin' Your Nose,~ then ~Nosin' Your Blow.~ It has to be heard to be believed. The first disc contains some valuable early Morrison material, including versions of ~Beside You~ and ~Madame George,~ later to turn up on the 1968 masterpiece Astral Weeks. But the ~Jamming Session~ is a hoot.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

With Mark Isham's lonely muted trumpet up front, listeners are in the jazz world immediately with ~Haunts of Ancient Peace,~ merging perfectly with Morrison's idiosyncratic vocal style. A low-pressure soul-jazz organ riff lays down the base of the most easily assimilated track, ~Satisfied,~ as Morrison's lyric indicates that he has reached a state of internal peace. ~Wild Honey~ has R&B horn riffs over Philly-style strings, while ~Spirit~ mostly pursues a self-fulfillment path similar to that of ~Satisfied.~ Ultimately, the record stands or falls upon two remarkable, gigantic 15-minute pieces, ~Summertime in England~ and ~When Heart Is Open.~ The propulsive opening of ~Summertime~ drops names of Morrison's favorite poets and authors; the track teeters upon indulgence but you are drawn in by Morrison's obsessions with lines and phrases like ~common one~ and ~let your red robe go,~ his voice becoming a twin brother of arranger Pee Wee Ellis' riffing sax. Lonely horns over the hilltops open ~When Heart Is Open,~ and it begins to resemble a sequel to Miles Davis' treatment of ~In a Silent Way,~ setting a peaceful, mesmerizing mood that carries you through its enormous length to the end of the record. No wonder the rock critics of the time didn't get it; this is music outside the pop mainstream, and even Morrison's own earlier musical territory.

Its latest offering revisits two classic Van Morrison concerts culled from the famous jazz festival of the same name, resulting in a deluxe double disc with extensive liner notes. Believe it or not, Morrison has never released an official concert DVD until now, previously only appearing in various VHS incarnations or television specials. While this conversion of sets from 1974 and 1980 may have been long overdue, the collection is well worth the wait (especially in a day in age when this particular performer is charging higher ticket prices and playing less material).</p><p>The 1980 performance is actually the best of the pair, if only for its expanded set list and treatment of Morrison's more notable cuts. Along with a sterling backing band laced in soul, R&B, jazz and pop, he nestles into muscular versions of ~Wavelength~ and ~Kingdom Hall,~ demonstrating lead guitar licks and rich vocal presentation. ~Moondance~ is particularly magical, carrying on with ample band improv that thankfully never becomes overly extravagant, while ~Wild Night~ is a smoky rave up that puts to shame John Mellencamp's mediocre comeback cover. The concert concludes with ~Angelou,~ a slow jazz jam that mounts with remarkable passion and beauty, simmering out the exceptional evening on a tender note.</p><p>Dipping back even further in time is the 1974 disc, a much shorter offering with only nine songs, but one that's still vital, showcasing an even younger, more spirited Morrison. The digital restoration and new remixes are especially evident on this piece of vintage footage, which also encompasses several of the singer/songwriter's earlier chestnuts, such as the high pitched powerhouse ~Twilight Zone,~ the horn heavy ~Heathrow Shuffle~ and the husky handed ~Naked In the Jungle.~ While more casual fans will miss ~Brown Eyed Girl~ and the recurring live romp ~Gloria,~ there's still plenty to savor in this impressive package. It will also take faithful followers back to the days when Morrison was a little more spontaneous and lively as a showman (long before the days of diva-like behavior or uneven album output), cementing his place as a pioneering blue-eyed soul force.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Andy Argyrakis</strong></p>"

Still, this winds up being a stronger articulation of what Morrison was attempting to do on Common One — much like how Wavelength got A Period of Transition right. That doesn't mean that this is a particularly easy album to warm to, since Morrison seems to be consciously creating an insular world here, only of interest to those willing to delve deeply into his own world, letting his elliptical melodies charm instead of frustrate, to let the leisurely pace seduce rather than lull. Once you do that, the record reveals such charming moments as ~She Gives Me Religion,~ ~Beautiful Vision,~ and ~Cleaning Windows,~ a skipping light R&amp;B tune that became one of his latter-day standards. Too much of Beautiful Vision is the product of a willfully idiosyncratic yet oddly measured vision to make it essential for anyone other than diehards, but moments such as that make it worth a listen.</P><P>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B></P>"

The arrangement and the artist's engaged singing leads to a brilliant result, and these Irish classics are made very accessible without being transformed into pop songs. Of the ten tracks included, eight are Irish trads. The title track and ~Celtic Ray~ are written by Morrison, and also appear on Beautiful Vision and Inarticulate Speech of the Heart, but since they are written in a pseudo traditional style, the folksy treatment given them by the Chieftains makes these versions sound as if they were the originals.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lars Lovén</strong></p>"

(His fans concurred; the album was his highest-charting effort in more than 20 years and earned a gold record.) He then took an uncharacteristically long three years to make a new original album, though he produced two side projects, the live Skiffle Sessions: Live in Belfast 1998 and You Win Again, a duet record with Linda Gail Lewis, in between. Down the Road is not bitter, but it does look to the past continually and with longing. Musically, it mixes R&B and jazz with bits of country (especially on ~What Makes the Irish Heart Beat~) and folk, all conjured from the singer's 1950s youth. Lyrically, it deliberately makes use of blues clichés and catch phrases to tell its tales of struggle, recollection, and regret. The album cover depicts the front of a record store, Music and Memorabilia, with a window full of LP covers by blues, R&B, jazz, and old rock & roll artists, and the music inside corresponds to that picture, in spirit if not always in style. A key song, and a curious one, is ~Whatever Happened to PJ Proby?,~ in which Morrison identifies himself with trendy British pop singers of the early '60s, including Scott Walker and Screaming Lord Sutch. It's hard to imagine that he really thinks he belongs in their company, but he seems both sincere and pained as he concludes, ~And whatever happened to me?~ If such humility is sincere, it may help explain why Morrison has rejected the trappings of fame all these years, and it makes him all the more endearing.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

While there are some left-field choices, among them his collaboration with the Chieftains on ~Irish Heartbeat,~ as well as ~Bright Side of the Road~ (from 1997's Fever Pitch) and ~Someone Like You,~ a song from Morrison's Poetic Champions Compose album that was used in 1995's French Kiss, the collection also doubles as a passable Morrison greatest hits. ~Brown Eyed Girl~ finds its way in via Born on the Fourth of July, ~Have I Told You Lately?~ qualifies for its appearance in One Fine Day, and ~Wild Night~ makes it thanks to Thelma & Louise.

Thus, classic Morrison tracks such as ~Domino,~ ~Into the Mystic,~ ~Moondance~ (this version is previously unreleased), and ~Caravan,~ while technically representing certain films, are also cheats.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jeff Tamarkin</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Van Morrison stopped having hits long before the release of the second volume of The Best of Van Morrison in 1993, so it's not practical to assume that its double-disc successor -- delivered a whopping 14 years later, compared to the three separating the first two volumes -- has songs that are familiar to a general audience. Nor should it be assumed that this is a collection of great songs that he's written in that decade-and-a-half, since this is chock-full of covers, including revivals of songs he recorded throughout his career. Furthermore, a full 14 songs -- the length of the first disc of this comp -- are credited as collaborations, and include some previously unreleased cuts that can be counted among a handful of rarities here. It's idiosyncratic, which perhaps could be expected from any comp assembled by the artist himself, but it's also accurate, and it helps makes sense of a rather odd stretch of album-making in a way that's necessary. Taken one at a time, Van's excursions into jazz, country, even skiffle seemed odd, but condensed into this 31-track set, it not only makes sense, it makes an argument that Van has been more true -- if not necessarily vital -- than many of his peers in his latter days. Instead of churning out songs that he's not inspired to write, he's relying on standards to find himself, and finding more inspiration in singing with others than flying solo. As individual records, some of these albums were bewildering, some were quite wonderful, but excerpted and sculpted into something resembling a testimonial, if not a narrative, it's easier to understand what Morrison was up to during a span where he never delivered one album as acclaimed or vital as Dylan or Young (or even McCartney or the Stones), but this goes a long way to proving that hardly means he stopped making good music. If anything, listening to his music in this fashion makes a strong argument for the value of this decade-and-a-half of recording better than any individual Van album from this time, so it's as worthy a listen for those fans who have followed him loyally over these 15 years as it is for those who bowed out around the time of the last The Best of Van Morrison.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

The interesting thing is that of these 21 cuts, only about half of them will be recognizable to the casual Van Morrison fan, as they come from his Bang sides and the far more popular Warner Brothers singles of the early '70s. As it should be, although there is one glaring omission: ~Tupelo Honey~ is absent from the song list. The rest may not have been greatest hits in America, but they do represent a fine -- if arguable -- selection of the material from the late '70s, '80s, and '90s. ~Dweller on the Threshold~ is here (though it sounds like an alternate take!) There is a bona fide alternate take of ~The Healing Game~ that sounds more like a well-executed demo and has plenty of Celtic soul. ~Someone Like You~ is here, as is ~Wavelength,~ and some tunes that deserved far better than they got: ~Tore Down à la Rimbaud,~ ~Real Real Gone,~ ~Bright Side of the Road,~ ~Days Like This,~ and ~Stranded.~ The early tunes are immediately recognizable, from ~Brown Eyed Girl,~ ~Gloria,~ ~Here Comes the Night,~ ~Domino,~ ~Moondance,~ ~Wild Night,~ and ~Jackie Wilson Said (I'm In Heaven).~ In sum, as far as the many repackaged greatest hits, this is one of the better ones as it is cross-licensed and contains a true evolutionary portrait of the artist on a journey that certainly winds and turns back on itself even as it moves forward. This is a good one with fine sound. [Polydor's 2007 Canadian edition added 16 tracks across its two-CD set.]</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>When an artist decides to perform a classic album in concert, the possibilities for disaster are myriad. Van Morrison's Astral Weeks had never been performed as a cycle before these performances at the Hollywood Bowl. With only one full band rehearsal, Van responded by bringing this mythic material to life with a rock showman's sense of audacity, a poet's vulnerability, a jazzman's sense of timing, and the mastery of a singer who knows where to find the hidden magic in his material. Morrison took the original track order and shuffled it to make it flow better live. He extended most tunes, turning some into mini-suites while tightening others. His well-seasoned lower register voice turned the wonder of a boy in 1968 into the spiritual receptivity and wisdom of a man who has weathered 40 more seasons of discontent and heartbreak.</p><p>The title track opens the set with that familiar up and down acoustic bassline andJay Berliner's nylon string guitar playing blues and jazz runs as Van keeps the first rhythm guitar chair down.(Berliner was lead guitarist on the original Astral Weeks sessions.) It's a tiny bit faster, but the flow is impeccable as skeletal strings come pouring through in the gaps. There is a beautiful sense of space as Tony Fitzgibbon's violin and viola solos come through in the middle and Richie Buckley's flute hovers from the margins. Morrison lets his players shine; he rises to improve with them, feeling his lyrics anew. He adds more gospel flavor to the tune, which is rooted there anyway with ~I Believe I've Transcended.~ And you believe him. The live mix clicks and crackles; it's raw, full, and immediate, without overdubs.</p><p>The track order changes after ~Beside You.~ It lilts and wanders with beautiful vibe work and Berliner's guitar. The first real surprise is ~Slim Slow Slider,~ the closing cut on the original set is the third one here. The deep sorrow, helplessness, and dread in the tune is captured through melancholy memory, balanced by a sense of the previous, not weighted so much with trouble. But Morrison's present tense protagonist is engulfed in pain and confesses the weight is more than he can bear in the effortless segue called ~I Start Breakin' Down.~ The drama is so arresting the listener can forget to breathe. The blues are heavy, the droning hypnotic Celtic ones that is, and they are never static. ~Sweet Thing,~ and ~The Way Young Lovers Do,~ are placed in succession here; they lock the listener in a breezy yet tight swinging groove. The strings caress Morrison's lyric without sweetness; the guitars create a bridge to deliver a strutting ~Cypress Avenue,~ which is appended seamlessly with the killer bluesy soul of ~You Come Walkin' Down.~ ~Ballerina,~ slows it down again and Morrison delivers his best vocal performance of the evening, though ~Madame George,~ which closes out the Astral Weeks material, is a close second; these cuts are simply an amazing one-two knockout. The band and the singer gel perfectly. There are two amazing encores: a dynamite, even shockingly spiritual autobiographical read of ~Listen to the Lion~ from 1972's Saint Dominic's Preview with saxophones, guitars, and strings all pushing against his vocal that moans and wails and roars before breaking through. The night ends with a sultry, scatting read of the title cut from 1980's Common One.</p><p>Astral Weeks: Live at the Hollywood Bowl is not Astral Weeks, but it's brilliant and emotionally intense; it's honest and spiritually revealing. Morrison not only inhabits these songs 40 years later, but he fully understands them; making for a extremely engaging and necessary document from an artist who still has plenty of fire in his belly.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

Bored by the sleepy life their hometown of Teignmouth, Devon provided, the three friends began playing music together. They started the first incarnation of their band when they were all 13, changing the name of the group from Gothic Plague to Fixed Penalty to Rocket Baby Dolls as time passed. By 1997 the band settled on the name Muse and released their self-titled debut EP on Dangerous Records, followed by the Muscle Museum EP in 1998. The group's emotive, Radiohead-like sound and live dates drew critical acclaim and industry buzz, and after a trip to New York's CMJ festival, Muse signed a deal with Maverick Records. Singles like ~Cave~ and ~Uno~ preceded their debut full-length album Showbiz, which was released toward the end of 1999. Two years later, Muse issued The <i>Origin of Symmetry</i> and had a major hit with ~Hyper Music.~ In 2002, fans were treated to the double-disc live set <i>Hullabaloo</i>. Muse's fourth album, <i>Absolution</i>, got the usual royal treatment upon its late-2003 release. Stateside fans finally got a taste of <i>Absolution</i> when it was released on Warner Bros. the following March.

Frontman Matt Bellamy and company stick to the same disturbed, and sometimes disturbing, formula that's worked in the past: the emotional intensity and style of Radiohead, a rock thunder descended from Black Sabbath, and the baroque drama of Queen. Longtime producer John Leckie sits this one out, and in steps indie uber-engineer Rich Costey. With Costey manning the desk, the music feels more polished and slick, but less epic and raw. Longtime fans won't miss a beat though, because Bellamy delivers the same Thom Yorke vocal impersonation for which he's known, and continues the same anthemic posturing he's lifted from Freddie Mercury. With song titles and subject matter fueled by fear of the apocalypse, and worries about infidelities and random murders, the subject matter is as gloriously pretentious and lovably unlovable as ever. Newcomers to the band should expect killer guitars reminiscent of jackhammers and chainsaws, bloodcurdling choruses, and, of course, tender passages of falsetto. A recurring motif of racing samplers suggests nothing less than a rock opera version of the score to Koyaanisqatsi, and then there are the occasional spooky moments where funky rhythms mingle with heavy metal guitars, suggesting a progressive Italian zombie flick soundtrack. There's little point in selecting highlights, because other than some slow moments that feel tacked on, there's not much variation in theme or mood. Many listeners will probably prefer to tackle the album in small doses, and only the most headstrong won't require a breather. Muse continue to make unrelenting hardcore art rock; Absolution is a tad cheesy, a bit too grandiose in its ambitions, bursting at the seams with too many ideas, and thus exactly what any Muse fan craves.</p>&mdash; <b>Tim DiGravina</b>"

They never sold many records in their own time, until near the end of their history as a band, but they were among the 1960s groups that had some of the greatest influence on the music of the early '70s. In the beginning, they were just supposed to provide backup, à la Booker T. &amp; the MG's, for American-born soul singer P.P. Arnold, an ex-member of the Ikettes who producer/manager/music mogul Andrew Oldham believed he could make into the next Tina Turner. Keyboard player Keith Emerson had previously played in Gary Farr &amp; the T-Bones, and the new group's rhythm section was filled by T-Bones alumni Lee Jackson on bass and Ian Hague on drums, while former Attack guitarist Davy O'List filled the fourth spot. They got together in May of 1967 and proved so powerful an ensemble on-stage, backing Arnold, that they soon earned billing on their own at the National Jazz and Blues Festival that summer, and by that fall had a recording contract of their own with Oldham's Immediate Records. Hague, however, proved a weak link in their lineup, in part owing to his devotion to the use of various controlled substances, and by the time they were ready to formally begin recording, he was replaced by O'List's onetime Attack bandmate Brian Davison. They were an amazingly freewheeling outfit, in keeping with the times. Although Jackson handled most of the singing, O'List also took a lead vocal on occasion, and even Emerson would end up on the microphone. </P><P>They played a strange mix of psychedelic blues, heavily laced with cadenza-like solos on the piano or organ, and dressed up in ornate, flashy guitar, reminiscent of Jimi Hendrix -- amid the pop flourishes and heavy piano and guitar riffs, one could hear influences of classical, soul, and jazz. Their debut album was ready for release early in 1968 but was delayed getting into stores until much later in the year, at which point they had released a single to support it -- their chosen track was a driving, flashy, instantly memorable instrumental rendition of the song ~America~ from West Side Story that got them lots of airplay and bade fair to get them on the U.K. charts, until objections to a very tasteless picture-sleeve design, coupled with the complaint of co-author Leonard Bernstein that he'd never given the group permission to revamp his piece -- which led to their inability to get the single issued in America -- took the wind out of their sails. Their year's worth of work had begun to build the group, and especially the extrovert personality of Emerson, a following in England. The organist player would jam knives into his keyboards, set fire to various objects on-stage (including, at least once, at Royal Albert Hall, the American flag, creating a potential diplomatic incident for the government), and simulate sex with his instrument -- by 1968, he was known as the Jimi Hendrix of the keyboard. </P><P>But amid the controversy over the single, the quartet's debut album, The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack -- which actually sounded very different from the single, and already very dated, died a withering death on record shop shelves during the summer of 1968. In truth, the debut LP was probably held up too long and released too late anyway, its cheery psychedelia being a little old-fashioned by the summer of 1968. There was a distinctly unusual undercurrent to the music, however, beneath the trippy pop tunes and spaced-out lyrics, that could have saved the record. The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack sounded different from virtually anything else in music at the time -- spook-house organ solos and slashing guitar attacks that ran together and clashed, and heavily veiled quotations from Dave Brubeck, among other sources; ~Rondo~ was nothing less than a large-scale psychedelic rock adaptation of ~Blue Rondo a la Turk.~ The band soldiered on, performing constantly and preparing to record a second album, when their second personnel problem reared its head, in the growing instability of guitarist Davy O'List; to add to the problems caused by his erratic behavior, it also became clear as the work on the second album progressed that O'List and Emerson were each trying to take center stage in their sound and music -- the first album had several tracks that featured their dueling, but it wasn't clear that their future lay in that direction. He left the group in the early fall of 1968, and wasn't replaced -- instead, the Nice became a trio of keyboards, bass (with a guitar added occasionally as needed, by Jackson or a guest support player), and drums. Their sound tightened and also evolved in a new direction -- although their second album, Ars Longa Vita Brevis, featured several striking songs and some clever lyrics, the center piece was the title suite, a rock/classical amalgam for band and orchestra that took up the whole second side -- that piece, which freely quoted from the Bach Brandenburg concertos, and a band rendition of the intermezzo from the Karelia Suite by composer Jean Sibelius, seemed to dominate the record and point the way to their future. Released in November of 1968, just four months after their debut album, Ars Longa Vita Brevis garnered sterling reviews -- praise that most acts only dream of receiving -- but it died a death in stores, without a single to help people grab hold of the album. By this time, the bandmembers were beginning to wonder if they were star-crossed. </P><P>They had a huge concert following in England and a growing reputation in continental Europe, with America just waiting for their next visit, but they'd sold very few records. Additionally, the group and their manager, Tony Stratton-Smith, were wary of the financial underpinnings of their label; Immediate Records always seemed to have someone demanding payment for some long overdue invoice or other, and lots of people hanging around trying to spend the company's money. Additionally, while a lot of recording always seemed to be going on, there wasn't a lot of chart action for the label -- with the exception of the Small Faces, whose sales made them Immediate's resident cash cow, few of the acts around them, good as some of them were (and many would say the Nice were the best of them), were earning money with their records, for themselves or the label.Still, they went ahead with plans for a third LP, which initially was to have been a live album recorded at the Fillmore East during their spring 1969 tour of the United States. The Nice had dazzled audiences along that tour (even managing to make an appearance with the Los Angeles Philharmonic), especially at those Fillmore shows, not just with Emerson's flashy stage presence but their ability to deconstruct songs by Bob Dylan and Tim Hardin and rebuild them completely in the group's image, yet leave enough that was familiar so that people could follow; and their accompanying ability to deconstruct familiar classical pieces in the same manner, and to meld rock, pop, jazz, and even soundtrack material coherently, and keep a crowd riveted by their work. In the end, the group's third album, variously titled Nice or Everything as Nice as Mother Makes It (or, later, Nice #3), was a mix of live and studio performances that showcased the group working from strength to strength, and evolving even on the record itself. Gone were the psychedelic flourishes of the first two albums -- instead, they were intense and concentrated in their focus on jazz and classical elements, a lean music machine that surged and pounded away at their material, yet who were subtle enough to work in delightful little embellishments, and playful and clever as well. The record peaked at number three on the British charts, and suddenly the Nice were ranked among the top bands in the country.It was just then that Immediate finally declared bankruptcy, owing a massive amount of royalties to the Nice (and a lot of other bands, including the Small Faces). </P><P>Having a major hit record and no money to show for it, the group was forced to maintain a ferocious touring schedule to keep itself solvent -- Nice had been the LP they'd been looking for, but it had come to nothing, in terms of moving the group to the next level, where they could tour less and write and record more.The band might have gotten past this debacle. Tony Stratton-Smith, in his wisdom, had held onto the live tapes from the Fillmore East that hadn't gone onto the third album, as well as the live recording of the group's most ambitious orchestral work yet, ~The Five Bridges Suite,~ and enough shorter studio sides that were close enough to being finished that there were at least two whole LPs that could be released -- that body of music represented not only breathing room and revenue, but also some of the Nice's best work. ~The Five Bridges Suite,~ despite some flaws in its recording, would only enhance their image, and once people heard Emerson's performance on the live version of ~Hang On to a Dream,~ his reputation from touring would be documented. As it was, the group had already provided the inspiration for one very important Dutch band, Ekseption, formed by Rick Van Der Linden out of admiration for the Nice -- what Stratton-Smith had in his possession would allow the Nice themselves to benefit from their work.It was not to be, mostly because Emerson had other plans. He'd always felt that the group's weak link was its vocals. Jackson was a limited singer and Emerson scarcely one at all (that's him singing lead on ~Happy Freuds~ from their second album) -- Emerson had even approached Duncan Browne, Immediate's resident singer/songwriter, who had worked with the band, about joining as a singer, but before that could happen one way or the other, he'd crossed paths with another, newer band called King Crimson and had been impressed by their lead vocalist/bassist, Greg Lake. Lake had grown increasingly unhappy as a member of the group since early 1969, and felt creatively constrained by guitar/co-founder Robert Fripp. Following the group's American tour in late 1969, he contacted Emerson and agreed to join up with him -- thus, Emerson was already set to leave the band by the end of that winter, though the decision wasn't announced publicly until the spring. Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer debuted that summer and went onto the kind of press coverage and record sales that the Nice never got anywhere near. Meanwhile, Stratton-Smith released the album Five Bridges on his own, newly founded Charisma Records&nbsp;label, and it sold well enough to justify a follow-up, Elegy, which showed audiences just how much the music community had lost when the Nice split up. </P><P>Ironically, in order to market those records more effectively in America, where the Nice had never enjoyed more than a cult following, U.S. licensee Mercury Records was compelled to repackage them into a double-LP set called Keith Emerson With the Nice, using an ELP-era photo of Emerson at his keyboard on-stage on its jacket. Emerson objected to the release of these albums, on artistic grounds, but a lawsuit failed to keep them off the market. In 1973, Stratton-Smith issued as third LP, known variously as Autumn to Spring or Autumn 1967 - Spring 1968, consisting of alternate takes and mixes of material from the group's first two LPs. In the decades since, thanks to Emerson's fame as a member of ELP and the Immediate bankruptcy, which placed its library in the hands of a succession of receivers who knew or cared little about music -- and the intentions of well-meaning producers who did care about the music -- the music on the Nice's three Immediate LPs turned up in various forms on vinyl, beginning with a fine series of albums from the Canadian Daffodil label and declining from there, and later on CD, some of the early examples of the latter horrendous sounding. In the 1990s, starting with Sony Music's reissue of their material, the quality of the group's masters has consistently been upgraded and enhanced, so that the current reissues, since the late '90s, are the best representation the group has ever had on record. Jackson and Davison went on to various projects that never succeeded, and in 1973 tried to get a second bite of the apple by forming Refugee with keyboard player Patrick Moraz, but there was little interest in their sound or records. By the end of the 1970s, with a change in public taste, even ELP had overstayed their welcome, amid their bombast and pretentiousness, and came to a halt. In 1999, as a one-off event on a personal occasion, Emerson, Jackson, and Davison played together for the first time in 29 years, at a party. Their work from decades earlier continues to dazzle new listeners in the 21st century, with each new reissue.</P>—<B> Bruce Eder</B>",

				"review": "<p>Five Bridges is a delectable representation of early-'70s progressive rock. It's make-up contains all of the elements needed to complete a solid prog album: a heavy intermingling of synthesizer and electric guitar, strong punctuation of both bass and drums, a central concept, and the fusing of rock and classical music, which in this case employs the Sinfonia of London. The eight tracks, centered around Newcastle's urban structure and life in a blue collar society, are as colorful as they are intricate. ~Intermezzo~ from Sibelius' ~Karelia Suite~ and Tchaikovsky's ~Pathetique~ are marvelous examples of classical and rock commingling, with the spotlight focused on Keith Emerson's keyboard virtuosity. The second movement from ~Fantasia~ is a sparkling model of improvisational use containing various rock &amp; roll rhythms and time structures, while the third track entitled ~High Level Fugue 4th Bridge~ was inspired by Guida's ~Prelude and Fugue~ and incorporates assorted jazz techniques and boogie-woogie styles into a classical recipe. ~Country Pie/Brandenburg Concerto, No. 6~ unites Dylan with Bach for a most extraordinary illustration of instrumental creativity. Each example of genre merging is pristine and fluid, making the actual overlapping of multiple styles completely transparent. Five Bridges may rank just a tad below The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack or Ars Longa Vita Brevis on the patience scale, but it does demonstrate how Emerson's work with ELP came into fruition. The reissued CD offers five bonus tracks, including the famed ~America~ and ~The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack,~ taken from the Autumn 1967 - Spring 1968 album. The track titled ~Diary From an Empty Day~ is an archival addition.</p>— <b>Mike DaGagne</b>"

				"review": "<p>There have been so many reissues and recompilations of the music that the Nice did for Immediate Records that it's difficult even for people who worked on those reissues to tell some of them apart without a scorecard. However, this set stands out, not only for its comprehensive nature but also for its sound quality, which is exceptional. The vexing aspect of working with the Nice's Immediate catalog was the lack of first-generation master tapes -- the record company's holdings were scattered to the four winds when it went bankrupt at the dawn of the 1970s, and the closest that anyone got on the early CDs was Sony in the early '90s, with the clean original production masters from the Columbia-distributed Immediate catalog. Castle Communications, however, has finally found what sounds like the real thing, and it makes a world of difference: no background noise, minimal tape hiss, each instrument loud and upfront, and all of the playing sharply delineated even in the busiest passages of the group's most complex works. What's more, the stereo separation is now sharp enough to enhance the music in a serious way -- the divided string section in the ~Brandenburger~ section of ~Ars Longa Vita Brevis,~ for example, adds to the appeal of the band's playing in ways that were difficult to discern on earlier CD releases, as well as on most of the LP issues.</p><p>And the live cuts from the Fillmore East from the third album are now transcendent -- every note is right in your lap, from Brian Davison's rapid-fire drumming to Keith Emerson's dizzying keyboard flourishes, and the balance between Emerson's organ and Lee Jackson's bass on ~She Belongs to Me~ is finally set at a proper level on a CD, for the first time. Just as important as the research that went into locating the first-generation tapes is the producers' success in finding the group's complete alternate takes; every odd outtake that ever surfaced in the band's history is present on disc three of this set, along with a quartet of previously unreleased live tracks recorded in concert during 1968 and 1969, among them ~America,~ the fourth movement of Tchaikovsky's Pathetique symphony, and the Troika from Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kijé suite (which was later adapted by Emerson, Lake & Palmer into ~I Believe in Father Christmas~). This three-CD set comes in three separate narrow jewel cases in a slipcase with a full set of notes, and is bargain-priced at under $30.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

		"firstname": "Michael",

		"name": "Michael Nyman",
		"biography": "<P>Celebrated for his modular, repetitive style, minimalist composer Michael Nyman was among experimental music's most high-profile proponents, best known in connection with his film scores for director Peter Greenaway. Born in London on March 23, 1944, he studied at the Royal Academy of Music and King's College, London, under communist composer Alan Bush and Thurston Dart, a musicologist specializing in the English Baroque. Under Dart's tutelage, Nyman was introduced to 16th- and 17th-century English rounds and canons, their repetitive, contrapuntal lines highly influencing his own later work; Dart also encouraged him to travel to Romania in the interest of seeking out the country's native folk music traditions. Upon graduating during the mid-'60s, Nyman found himself disconnected from both the pop music of the times and the school of modern composition heralded by Stockhausen; as a result, from 1964 to 1976, he worked not as a composer but as a music critic, writing for publications including The Listener, New Statesman, and The Spectator. In a review of British composer Cornelius Cardew, he first introduced the word ~minimalism~ as a means of musical description.</P><P>During this same period, Nyman did continue performing, appearing with artists ranging from the Scratch Orchestra and Portsmouth Sinfonia to Steve Reich and the Flying Lizards. In 1974, he wrote the influential book Experimental Music -- Cage and Beyond, an exploration of the influence of John Cage on a generation of composers and performers. Perhaps its most profound impact was on Nyman himself, who through writing the book seemed to discover his own muse; in 1976 he accepted an invitation from Harrison Birtwistle, Director of Music at the National Theatre, to arrange a number of 18th-century Venetian popular songs for a production of Goldoni's Il Campiello. Nyman's arrangements consisted of medieval instruments -- rebecs, sackbuts and shawms, bass drums, soprano saxophones, and the like -- designed for maximum loudness to produce a distinctive instrumental color; when the production ended, he began composing original music merely to keep the same group of musicians together. Originally an acoustic unit, when rechristened the Michael Nyman Band in the early '80s, amplification became essential to their aesthetic.</P><P>Nyman's first major success came in 1982 with the score to the Greenaway film The Draughtsman's Contract; his subsequent collaborations with Greenaway on pictures including 1988's Drowning By Numbers, 1989's The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, and 1991's Prospero's Books remain among his most high-profile works, their notoriety coming at the risk of overshadowing his forays into opera, chamber music, vocal music, and dance scores. The signatures of Nyman's work include not only his use of propulsive repetition, but also a palette of idiosyncratic instrumental touches -- thumping keyboards, ~rude~ bass clarinets, and baritone saxophones, and extreme high and low octave doublings. Mozart was a central influence in much of his work, including 1976's In Re Don Giovanni and 1983's I'll Stake My Cremona to a Jew's Trump; Schumann, meanwhile, was the major inspiration behind the acclaimed 1986 chamber opera The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, while Bartok shades 1988's String Quartet No. 2, commissioned for the Indian dancer and choreographer Shobana Jeyasingh.</P><P>In 1990, Nyman composed Six Celan Songs, a work based on the poems of Paul Celan, for the German cabaret singer Ute Lemper, with whom he first worked on the score for Prospero's Books. His most emotional compositions to date, they served as the clear impetus for his score to Jane Campion's 1992 film The Piano, easily Nyman's best-known work; like so many of his compositions, he obsessively reworked the music to The Piano time and time again, the haunting melodies reappearing arranged for standard piano concerto, for two pianos, for chamber ensemble, for soprano saxophone and strings (Lost and Found), and for soprano and string quartet (The Piano Sings). While 1992's The Upside-Down Violin reflected Nyman's continuing fascination with traditional ethnic musics, 1993's MGV, or Musique a Grande Vitesse, returned to the propulsive sounds of the Michael Nyman Band. Other major works include 1992's Time Will Pronounce, 1993's Yamamoto Perpetuo (a composition for unaccompanied violin written for Alexander Balanescu), 1994's solo harpsichord work Tango for Tim, and 1995's String Quartet No. 4. Among Nyman's film scores: 1995's Carrington and 1997's Gattaca.</P><P>— <B>Jason Ankeny</B></P>",

Remastered in digital surround sound and shot -- appropriately -- in moody black and white at L.A.'s Coconut Grove, the concert features haunting performances of ~Only the Lonely,~ ~Running Scared,~ and ~Blue Bayou~ from Orbison, who is supported by stars such as k.d. lang, Bonnie Raitt, Elvis Costello, J.D. Souther, Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne, Tom Waits, and Jennifer Warnes. Backed by Elvis' touring band from the late '60s and '70s, this all-star lineup shines on Orbison classics ranging from rockers like ~Ooby Dooby,~ ~Oh, Pretty Woman,~ and ~Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)~ to yearning ballads like ~In Dreams,~ ~Crying,~ and ~It's Over.~ Though some DVD extras like a biography or discography would have been nice, Roy Orbison: Black &amp; White Night will delight Orbison fans with its well-chosen setlist, refined production values, and strong performances.</p><p>—  <b>Heather Phares</b></p>"

		"name": "Christopher Parkening",
		"biography": "<p>Christopher Parkening is one of the world's leading classical guitarists, with a particular interest in continuing the legacy of Andrés Segovia.</p><p>Parkening was inspired to play guitar by his cousin Jack Marshall, the former staff guitarist at MGM Studios. Marshall had two recommendations: learn classical technique in order to establish firm technical skills, and study the recordings of Segovia. Hearing Segovia's recordings convinced Parkening to continue within the classical tradition. Parkening began his studies with Pépe Romero, and at the age of fifteen entered Segovia's master class at the University of California, Berkeley. He also studied musical interpretation with cellist Gregor Piatigorsky. His college education was at the University of Southern California. Since the school had no guitar faculty, Parkening studied cello, first with Gabor Rajto, then with Piatigorsky. At the end of his sophomore year the Music Department asked him to start teaching guitar, thus beginning the guitar studies program at USC. At the same time he began playing professionally, launching a rising career that would cause Segovia to proclaim that ~Christopher Parkening is a great artist -- he is one of the most brilliant guitarists in the world.~</p><p>While harboring a disdain for traveling, Parkening played over ninety concerts a year with the primary purpose of early retirement in order to pursue his ~real~ passion: fly-fishing. In addition to his touring and teaching, he authored two volumes of The Christopher Parkening Guitar Method, as well as transcriptions of works by composers such as Debussy, Ravel, Bach, and Dowland. In accordance with his plan, in 1977 he bought a ranch in Montana and announced his retirement. Aside from a small amount of teaching at the University of Montana, he had nothing to do with music; he even quit regular practicing. After four years he found himself restless and unfulfilled. On a visit to California, a neighbor invited him to Grace Community Church where Rev. John MacArthur's sermon led Parkening to an intensive self-examination. Parkening realized that his discontent was due to the selfishness of his original goal, and the subsequent aimlessness of his life. He found the Biblical verse Corinthians 10:31: ~Whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God~ and recalled J.S. Bach's statement that ~The aim and final reason of all music is none but the glory of God.~</p><p>With Christianity as his inspiration he returned to playing, but now with the purpose of glorifying God. He sold his Montana ranch, despite warnings that it would be difficult to re-establish his career. Parkening has since performed around the world, including Carnegie Hall and the White House. His television appearances include the Grammy Awards, The Tonight Show, The Today Show, Good Morning America, and 20/20. He has recorded over twenty albums, and earned two Grammy nominations in the category of Best Classical Recording. He continues to appear with all the major orchestras of the United States while maintaining an active recital career. Voted ~Best Classical Guitarist~ in a nationwide readers’ poll of Guitar Player Magazine for many years, he was placed in their ~Gallery of Greats~ along with Andrés Segovia, John Williams, and Julian Bream. Parkening has received commendations honoring his dedication and artistry including an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Montana State University and the Outstanding Alumnus Award from the University of Southern California. Parkening was also given the acclaimed American Academy of Achievement Award for his excellence in music. He has also won the International Gold Cup Tarpon Tournament (the ~Wimbledon~ of fly-fishing).</p>&mdash; <b>Joseph Stevenson</b>",

		"biography": "<p><img src=~/images/gp01.jpg~ width=~201~ height=~201~ alt=~Howlin Wind~/>Howling Wind Stereotyped early in his career as the quintessential angry young man, Graham Parker was one of the most successful singer/songwriters to emerge from England's pub rock scene in the early '70s. Drawing heavily from Van Morrison and the Rolling Stones, Parker developed a sinewy fusion of driving rock & roll and confessional folk-rock, highlighted by his indignant passion, biting sarcasm, and bristling anger. At the outset of his career, his albums crackled with pub rock energy, snide witticisms, and gentle insights, earning him a devoted following of fans and critics, who lavished praise on his debut, Howlin' Wind. Despite all the positive word of mouth, Parker never managed to become a star, and he was soon overshadowed by the emergence of Elvis Costello, a singer/songwriter who shared similar roots. After delivering Squeezing Out Sparks in 1979, Parker attempted to make a few crossover albums before settling into a cult following in the late '80s and continuing to garner critical acclaim.</p><p>After spending much of his early adulthood working odd jobs, ranging from breeding mice and guinea pigs to working at a gas station, Parker began seriously pursuing a musical career in 1975. Until that time, he had played in a number of obscure pub rock groups, including a cover band that had spent time playing in Morocco and Gibraltar. But it wasn't until 1975 that he began shopping his demos. That year, Dave Robinson, one of the co-founders of the new independent label Stiff, heard one of Parker's demo tapes and encouraged the songwriter, helping him assemble a backing band called the Rumour. Robinson rounded up several stars of the pub rock scene -- guitarist Brinsley Schwarz and keyboardist Bob Andrews, both formerly of leading pub rockers Brinsley Schwarz, former Ducks Deluxe guitarist Martin Belmont, former Bontemps Roulez drummer Steve Goulding, and bassist Andrew Bodnar -- to form the Rumour, and the band was soon supporting Parker on the dying pub rock scene. With the assistance of DJ Charlie Gillett, the group landed a record contract with Mercury by the end of 1975.</p><p><img src=~/images/gp02.jpg~ width=~201~ height=~201~ alt=~Heat Treatment~/>Graham Parker & the Rumour headed into the studio to cut their debut album with producer Nick Lowe, who gave the resulting record, Howlin' Wind, an appealingly ragged edge. Howlin' Wind was greeted with enthusiastic reviews upon its summer release, as was the similar Heat Treatment, which followed in the fall. Despite the positive press, Parker was growing frustrated with Mercury, believing that the company was not properly promoting and distributing his records. His third album, Stick to Me, had to be re-recorded quickly after the original tapes were discovered to be defective prior to its scheduled release. As a result, Stick to Me received mixed reviews upon its fall 1977 release, which derailed Parker's momentum slightly. Furthermore, Elvis Costello, a fellow pub rock survivor who possessed not only a more pop-oriented style of songwriting, but also a more dangerous persona, soon eclipsed Parker in popularity. Frustrated by his career hitting a standstill, Parker released the live-double album The Parkerilla in the summer of 1978 in order to get out of his contract. Following a short but intense bidding war, he quickly signed to Arista Records, where he released ~Mercury Poisoning~ -- a blistering attack on his former record label and the B-side of a promotional single -- as his first record for the label.</p><p><img src=~/images/gp03.jpg~ width=~201~ height=~201~ alt=~The Up Escalator~/>Squeezing Out Sparks, Parker's first album for Arista, put a halt to that decline. Sporting a slicker, new wave-oriented production -- it was the first of his records not to have any involvement from Nick Lowe -- the album was greeted with terrific reviews and, on the strengths of radio hits like ~Local Girls,~ it became his most successful album, reaching number 40 on the American charts and selling over 200,000 copies. Parker was poised for a major breakthrough, but that didn't happen. He followed Squeezing Out Sparks in 1980 with the Jimmy Iovine-produced The Up Escalator, which was considerably slicker than its predecessor. The Up Escalator didn't sell, and Parker decided to ditch the Rumour, who had already begun a solo career. For 1982's Another Grey Area, he hired producer Jack Douglas and a team of session musicians, resulting in a radio-ready production that received mixed reviews, yet managed to peak at number 51. The Real Macaw, which followed in 1983, suffered a similar fate. For 1985's Steady Nerves, Parker moved to Elektra Records and formed a backing band called the Shot with guitarist Brinsley Schwarz, who helped him deliver his most radio-ready collection. This time, the pop move paid off. ~Wake Up (Next to You)~ became his only Top 40 hit, and the album stayed on the charts for nearly as long as Squeezing Out Sparks.</p><p><img src=~/images/gp04.jpg~ width=~201~ height=~201~ alt=~The Mona Lisa's Sister~/>Despite his moderate commercial success with Steady Nerves, the album wasn't widely praised, and he also ran into trouble with Elektra, leaving the label after just one record. He briefly moved to Atlantic, which dropped him without releasing a single record. Consequently, Parker wasn't able to deliver another album until 1988, when he signed with RCA and released The Mona Lisa's Sister in the spring. Hailed as a comeback by several critics upon its release, the album generated a college radio hit with ~Get Started (Start a Fire)~ and spent 19 weeks on the charts. Instead of being the beginning of a comeback, the album turned out to be a last gasp: it was the last time Parker was able to crack the Top 100. Live! Alone in America (1989) received positive reviews but was ignored, and 1990's mild worldbeat experiment Human Soul received mixed reviews and peaked at number 165 on the charts. Parker's final album for RCA -- and his last album to chart -- was the stripped-down Struck by Lightning (1991), and while it was critically praised, it didn't find an audience outside of his cult. The following year, he switched to Capitol and released Burning Questions, which was ignored.</p><p><img src=~/images/gp05.jpg~ width=~201~ height=~201~ alt=~Passion Is No Ordinary Word~/>The Graham Parker Anthology 1976-1991 Following the release of 1993's double-disc anthology Passion Is No Ordinary Word, Parker made the leap to independent labels -- he had spent time at all but one of the major labels (Columbia/Sony) with little success. In 1994, he released the Christmas Cracker EP on Dakota Arts, and then he signed with Razor & Tie, where he released 12 Haunted Episodes in the spring. Like The Mona Lisa's Sister and Struck by Lightning before it, 12 Haunted Episodes was hailed as a comeback, and it sold in respectable numbers for an indie release. Parker followed it with two albums in 1996, Live from New York, NY and Acid Bubblegum, which appeared within two months of each other late in the summer. Early in 1997, he released yet another live album, the double-disc The Last Rock N Roll Tour, which was recorded with the power pop quartet the Figgs. Parker continued to issue a steady stream of archive and live releases into the mid-2000s, and moved into singer/songwriter mode for the albums Deepcut to Nowhere and Your Country, the latter a roots rock-influenced affair released by the Chicago-based Bloodshot Records. The Figgs were back for 2005's Songs of No Consequence, an album that Parker declared ~rocks like safari park chimp~ in pre-release publicity. Unreleased material, rare edits, and remixes were featured on Official Art Vandelay Tapes, Vol. 2, which appeared two weeks after Songs of No Consequence. Don't Tell Columbus arrived in March 2007 and the clever Imaginary Television appeared in 2010, along with the DVD Live at the FTC.</p><p><img src=~/images/gp06.jpg~ width=~201~ height=~201~ alt=~Three Chords Good~/>Parker unexpectedly reunited his original backing band the Rumour in 2011, in part due to the intervention of longtime fan and filmmaker Judd Apatow, who made the group a plot point in his film This Is Forty. After appearing in the movie, the group recorded an album of new material, Three Chords Good, which arrived in November 2012, around the same time Apatow's movie was released. A concert shot for the film also received a stand-alone release on DVD and Blu-Ray under the title This Is Live. Parker and the Rumour took advantage of their new place in the spotlight by touring America and the UK in support of Three Chords Good, and in May 2015 they returned with another new LP, Mystery Glue, recorded during a six-day sprint at London's RAK Studios.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>",

Sounding like the bastard offspring of Mick Jagger and Van Morrison, Parker sneers his way through a set of stunningly literate pub rockers. Instead of blindly sticking to the traditions of rock & roll, Parker invigorates them with cynicism and anger, turning his songs into distinctively original works. ~Back to Schooldays~ may be reconstituted rockabilly, ~White Honey~ may recall Morrison's white R&B bounce, and ~Howlin' Wind~ is a cross of Van's more mystical moments and the Band, but the songs themselves are original and terrific. Similarly, producer Nick Lowe gives the album a tough, spare feeling, which makes Parker and the Rumour sound like one of the best bar bands you've ever heard. Howlin' Wind remains a thoroughly invigorating fusion of rock tradition, singer/songwriter skill, and punk spirit, making it one of the classic debuts of all time.</p><p><b>&mdash; Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b></p>"

Since many of the same musicians played on both G.P. (released in January of 1973) and Grievous Angel (which appeared in stores almost exactly a year later), the two albums flow together quite well as a single set. And while no bonus tracks were added, the booklet features well-written essays on Parsons from John M. Delgatto and Marley Brant, the complete liner notes from both albums, and lyrics for all the songs on the disc (which weren't included in the original vinyl issues). While the material and performances on G.P. are a shade stronger than on Grievous Angel, both albums have more than their share of pearly moments, and this disc is a treat from start to finish; James Burton's guitar leads are chicken-pickin' at its smartest and most tasteful, Al Perkins' pedal steel is the definitive sound of country & western heartache, fiddler Byron Berline effortlessly reveals how he became one of Nashville's leading session musicians, and Parsons' duets with the young Emmylou Harris are nothing less than sublime. And would anyone who loves either country or rock really want to be without a CD that includes songs like ~A Song for You,~ ~The New Soft Shoe,~ ~Big Mouth Blues,~ ~$1,000 Wedding,~ or ~In My Hour of Darkness~? While the definitive Gram Parsons collection has yet to be compiled, G.P./Grievous Angel gives you everything you really need from his solo career, and these 20 performances are among the most influential and satisfying music the genre of country-rock would ever produce.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Mark Deming</strong</p>"

		"biography": "<p>If the Delta country blues has a convenient source point, it would probably be Charley Patton, its first great star. His hoarse, impassioned singing style, fluid guitar playing and unrelenting beat made him the original king of the Delta blues. Much more than your average itinerant musician, Patton was an acknowledged celebrity and a seminal influence on musicians throughout the Delta. Rather than bumming his way from town to town, Patton would be called up to play at plantation dances, juke joints and the like. He'd pack them in like sardines everywhere he went, and the emotional sway he held over his audiences caused him to be tossed off of more than one plantation by the ownership, simply because workers would leave crops unattended to listen to him play any time he picked up a guitar. He epitomized the image of a '20s ~sport~ blues singer; rakish, raffish, easy to provoke, capable of downing massive quantities of food and liquor, a woman on each arm with a flashy, expensive looking guitar fitted with a strap and kept in a traveling case by his side, only to be opened up when there was money or good times involved. His records -- especially his first and biggest hit, ~Pony Blues~ -- could be heard on phonographs throughout the South. Although he was certainly not the first Delta bluesman to record, he quickly became one of the genre's most popular. By late-'20s Mississippi plantation standards, Charley Patton was a star, a genuine celebrity.</p><p>Although Patton was roughly five foot, five inches tall and only weighed a spartan 135 pounds, his gravelly, high-energy singing style (even on ballads and gospel tunes it sounded this way) made him sound like a man twice his weight and half again his size. <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B340~>Sleepy John Estes</a> claimed he was the loudest blues singer he ever heard and it was rumored that his voice was loud enough to carry outdoors at a dance up to 500 yards away without amplification. His vaudeville-style vocal asides -- which on record give the effect of two people talking to each other -- along with the sound of his whiskey- and cigarette-scarred voice would become major elements of the vocal style of one of his students, a young <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B60993~>Howlin' Wolf</a>. His guitar playing was no less impressive, fueled with a propulsive beat and a keen rhythmic sense that would later plant seeds in the boogie style of <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B371~>John Lee Hooker</a>. Patton is generally regarded as one of the original architects of putting blues into a strong, syncopated rhythm and the strident tone he achieves on record was achieved by tuning his guitar a step to a step and a half above standard pitch instead of using a capo. His compositional skills on the instrument are illustrated by his penchant for finding and utilizing several different themes as background accompaniment in a single song. His slide work -- either played in his lap like a Hawaiian guitar and fretted with a pocket knife or in the more conventional manner with a brass pipe for a bottleneck -- was no less inspiring, finishing vocal phrases for him and influencing contemporaries like <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B88049~>Son House</a> and up and coming youngsters like <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B91178~>Robert Johnson</a>. He also popped his bass strings (a technique he developed some 40 years before funk bass players started doing the same thing), beat his guitar like a drum and stomped his feet to reinforce certain beats or to create counter rhythms, all of which can be heard on various recordings. Rhythm and excitement were the bywords of his style.</p><p>The second, and equally important, part of Patton's legacy handed down to succeeding blues generations was his propensity for entertaining. One of the reasons for Charley Patton's enormous popularity in the South stems from him being a consummate barrelhouse entertainer. Most of the now-common guitar gymnastics modern audiences have come to associate with the likes of a <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B85934~>Jimi Hendrix</a>, in fact, originated with Patton. His ability to ~entertain the peoples~ and rock the house with a hell-raising ferociousness left an indelible impression on audiences and fellow bluesmen alike. His music embraced everything from blues, ballads, ragtime to gospel. And so keen were Patton's abilities in setting mood and ambience, that he could bring a barrelhouse frolic to a complete stop by launching into an impromptu performance of nothing but religious-themed selections and still manage to hold his audience spellbound. Because he possessed the heart of a bluesman with the mindset of a vaudeville performer, hearing Patton for the first time can be a bit overwhelming; it's a lot to take in as the music and performances can careen from emotionally intense to buffoonishly comic, sometimes within a single selection. It is all strongly rooted in '20s Black dance music and even on the religious tunes in his repertoire, Patton fuels it all with a strong rhythmic pulse.</p><p>He first recorded in 1929 for the Paramount label and within a year's time, he was not only the largest-selling blues artist but -- in a whirlwind of recording activity -- also the music's most prolific. Patton was also responsible for hooking up fellow players <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B60169~>Willie Brown</a> and <a href=~http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B88049~>Son House</a> with their first chances to record. It is probably best to issue a blanket audio disclaimer of some kind when listening to Patton's total recorded legacy, some 60 odd tracks total, his final session done only a couple of months before his death in 1934. We will never know what Patton's Paramount masters really sounded like. When the company went out of business, the metal masters were sold off as scrap, some of it used to line chicken coops! All that's left are the original 78s -- rumored to have been made out of inferior pressing material commonly used to make bowling balls (!) -- and all of them are scratched and heavily played, making all attempts at sound retrieval by current noise-reduction processing a tall order indeed. That said, it is still music well worth seeking out and not just for its place in history. Patton's music gives us the first flowering of the Delta blues form, before it became homogenized with turnarounds and 12-bar restrictions, and few humans went at it so agressively.</p><p> <b>Cub Koda, All Music Guide</b></p>",

				"review": "<P>The story of Delta blues starts with Charley Patton's slashing slide style, hoarse and gruff vocals, and unerring ability to personalize even the most mundane blues lyric. Patton's 78s have been collected in several fine packages, including the JSP box called Complete Recordings, Catfish's three-disc budget box called Definitive Charley Patton, and the last word in all this, the impressive (and expensive) seven-disc Screamin' and Hollerin' the Blues from Revenant Records. This single-disc selection from Proper works as an inexpensive single-disc introduction to Patton, and it contains his best-known songs like ~Pony Blues,~ the two-part ~High Water Everywhere,~ ~Down the Dirt Road Blues,~ ~High Sheriff Blues,~ and ~Revenue Man Blues.~ Since Patton's rhythms and overall approach can be repetitive at times, casual listeners wondering what all the fuss is about might be better served with a single disc like this one that hones things down a bit, but Patton's work is both the Big Bang and the epicenter of country blues, so going a little deeper and springing for one of the box sets is well worth the time and expense.</P><p>&mdash; <b>Steve Leggett</b></p>"

And as it is only slightly less thorough -- the Document discs include extra takes on ~Elder Green Blues,~ ~Hammer Blues,~ and ~Some of these Days I'll Be Gone~ -- this compilation seems the likely choice for anyone with an interest in pre-war Delta blues. Both affordable and handsomely packaged, the three-disc box includes extensive liner notes written by blues historians Keith Briggs and Alex Van Der Tuuk, with reminiscences by Patton crony Son House.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Travis Drageset</strong></p><hr/><p>The late 1800’s/early 1900’s, the term “redneck” had drastically different connotation than that which it carries today. Initially it was a verbal short hand to describe the Irish and Scottish immigrant farmers down south. After a day in the fields their necks burnt a lobster red. Like all who joined the great melting pot with dreams and hopes of something better, they brought their songs to sing with them. Folk melodies, murder ballads, played with a lot of the instruments which would be used for the early country music. This mixed with the sung laments of plantation slaves birthed the blues.</p><p>The earliest blues was a complex amalgam of these three seemingly divergent sources, country, folk and plain song brought over by the slaves. In the far future practitioners may have more chops, but the construction and influences would never again be as open minded, nor as organically mixed.</p><p>The embodiment of this first great wave of bluesmen was Charlie Patton. The exact date of his birth is often debated. Given sometimes as April 1887 or 1891. He himself was never sure, the later date being supplied by his parents for a 1900 census poll. He could not read or write except his name which he always slowly spelled out loud C-h-a-r-l-i-e. Ironically throughout his oeuvre it is spelled Charley.</p><p>Charlie was descended of mixed blood which included white, Native American and African American. The oddly pejorative term “good hair” (Caucasian-like) was often used to describe him when not talking about his music.</p><p>His family was religious and disapproved of his music and his casual teachers. The music was referred to as “Devil’s music” and his romance with it often earned him beatings from his father. Eventually, for whatever reason his father eased up, even buying Charlie a guitar. It was shortly after this he hit the road never again to return home for any real length of time.</p><p>Charlie’s main recorded output was the blues, but this was far more a financial decision on the part of the record company than a personal artistic choice on Charlie’s part. It was the same commercial consideration which largely kept Charlie’s less blues like pieces from ever seeing wax.</p><p>He did not seem to mind. Often to give an audience their money’s worth, when performing Charlie would toss and catch his guitar, play the underside percussively, drum like or when the mood struck him, behind his head. Considering what was resonating from him, all far from necessary.</p><p>Although he never liked to complain, like many artists of his day (and sadly, in ensuing decades) Charlie was taken advantage of by record companies. He and other artists would have to commute to Northern cities to record or in makeshift studios set up in barns or flop houses.</p><p>These early blues men were pursued by record companies not out respect for their artistic merits but in hope of creating an African American record buying (phonographs too) public. With few exceptions this was driving vision behind these small companies.</p><p>Pony Blues was successful, Charlie’s biggest seller (Paramount Records). In keeping with the times only the smallest trickle of money went to him. From his point of view, while never becoming rich, he was kept in sandwiches, whiskey and smokes. Always happy enough to not have to do manual labor as often.</p><p>Pea Vine Blues used a new gimmick thought up by the record company. The record was released with a contest. The singer was listed as “The Masked Marvel” its cover depicting an illustration which looked like Charlie donning a Lone Ranger styled mask. Contestants were asked to guess his identity. The winner received a Paramount Record of their choice. The contest entry forms accompanied the record all 10,000 sold out. Staggering when you consider that this was well before the age of mass media or quick communication. Paramount Records hedged their bets by also doing up 7000 promo posters and ads in The Chicago Defender, the premier paper for the other side of segregated America.</p><p>The initial pressing quickly sold out creating the market for a second pressing, a then rarity for such a specialized market.</p><p>Interestingly enough, Charlie had recorded (briefly) some religious hymns under the pseudonym J.J Hadley. Either name was an accepted answer for the contest.</p><p>Charlie was of average height and slight build (135lbs) but some of his material was musical boasts concerning his prowess and potency. (Charlie as a proto rapper?). Mostly though, he and other blues forefathers would recite topical verse over often simple but hypnotic beats. Charlie is believed to be the first one to use the now standard twelve bar blues pattern.</p><p>Initially, before the lexicon of blues standards was born, the tales in Charlie and his peers songs were intricate, image rich American Gothic. Flannery O’Connor meets the juke joint.</p><p>In Charlie’s lyrics, depending upon your point of view, God or the devil was ever present, not as an incarnation, but as natural calamities. Floods, the taste of one’s mortality, even boweevils. Despite the commercial considerations of what Charlie recorded, there was always more than just some woman having done him wrong. Deeper themes whose narrative complexity still retain their power in this modern age when Charlie’s way of life has long since vanished.</p><p>Another key appeal of Charlie’s work was his vocals. The lyrics were often obscured. The cadence of his voice being used as a second instrument. There is something about the sound of those simple, yet hypnotic beats mixing with that voice. It reaches deep down into you, a primal twitch. I like to listen to this in the dark. You should listen to this in the dark, listen anywhere desolation and appetite can be poetry.</p><p>It was said that Charlie had, had eight wives. At the very least he had eight roommates. With a hair trigger temper he had fought with all of them.</p><p>When not in jail, sick or recording, this American troubadour was out living the life he would represent in his art. Reporting on what he saw and interjecting his own opinions. One of the strongest tracks off of CD #2 is “High Water Everywhere”. This was based off of the 1927 Mississippi flood and its after effects as he witnessed them. It is from the episodic growl as much as the cabaret theater world of Brecht/Weil that Tom Waits would build his initial musical foundation  off of.</p><p>Long time brother in arms Willie Brown spent years observing and playing with Charlie. From the practical application of this apprenticeship Willie became a great blues man in his own right. It was from Willie in the 1920’s a teenage Robert Johnson attempted to learn.</p><p>With the onslaught of the depression, many small record labels folded, times were tough all around and Charlie made due the best he could. By the mid 1930’s, Charlie, in his mid forties began to feel the effects of his lifestyle. A fight one night ended with Charlie having his throat slit and living to sing about it. Bad woman, good cocaine and strong whiskey with an endless supply of cigarettes to mark the time in between each.</p><p>1934 saw the depression finally beginning to bottom out. People no longer needed to be tunnel-visioned on how to eat, where to find work. It would be several more years until it was done with completely. The theory that affordable distractions will always make money in times of trouble has been proven again and again.</p><p>W.R Calaway of The American Record Corporation wanted to record Charlie. For what would be Charlie’s last sessions he tracked the artist and his wife Bertha Lee who would share vocal duties, down to a Mississippi jail where they were both serving time for having had one of their knock down drag outs at a house party. W.R Calaway made bail and brought the pair to New York.</p><p>New York was having one of its bad winters. Charlie was already frail and sick. Both in lyrical content and in his haunted performance Charlie seems to have felt the ebb and flow of his mortality.</p><p>One of Charlie’s last recorded songs was 34 Blues, 34 being slang for “go away”. Three months after his final sessions while living on a plantation with another woman Charlie died of a heart condition brought on by an attack of rheumatic fever. As he lay dying, in delirium, it was to the reciting of one of the religious hymns he recorded as J.J Hadley he occupied his last days until death finally took him.</p><p>The sound on these three CDs is good, it has been cleaned up, but not sanitized to the point of loosing its soul in studio artificiality. At times there is the ambient presence of a 78’s hiss. It works, it belongs. The effect is akin to listening to some of the great prewar Edith Piaf recordings which contain the same hiss. It furthers the effect of being spoken to from another time, without ever distracting or lessening the art. So well does it work, it almost seems as if these two artists, so different, both incorporate the hiss and technological limitations into their deliveries and technique.</p><p>The songs are all presented in chronological order which I always think is a nice touch. Aside from the aforementioned “High Water Everywhere” another personal favorite (CD #2) is “Mean Black Moan” which features a trance inducing guitar pattern, with the singing violin sounding almost like an upper register clarinet all occurring while the tale is told.</p><p>Henry Sims on violin is perfect. He had a touch which managed to be both raw and subtle. He would go on to work with later day blues man Muddy Waters. It offers a glimpse of what might have been if Charlie had had opportunity for more instrumentation or at least further sympathetic accompaniment.</p><p>The packaging is nice. The three CDs are packaged in hard cardboard sleeves to look like old  78’s which are housed in a good looking little box with an eighteen page informative booklet.</p><p>This compares nicely with “The Best of Charlie Patton” (1 CD Yazoo). Yazoo was one of foremost revivalist of early American music chroniclers. This is one CD and not really that much less than this three CD set.</p><p>The crown jewel for any serious collector is “Screamin’ and Hollerin’ the Blues:The Worlds of Charley Patton” (7 CDs Revenant Records) This is literally functional art. Designed to look like a large 78’s record box, it includes lots of reading material including the long out of print thesis on Charlie by John Fahey, stickers interviews and other Charlie related literature. An investment to be sure, but worth it.</p><p>It was not until 1980 Charlie was actually induced into The Blues Foundation’s hall of fame. In 1990 singer John Fogerty paid for a proper funerary monument to be erected. Other Mississippi blues men are talked about and sited more often. Charlie’s stuff, because of its deeply personal delivery would be far harder to emulate. This is the king. From the roots of this musical tree would flow far reaching and diverse branches.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Maxwell Chandler</strong></p>"

He resurfaced in 1973 with the more versatile and democratic Better Days. Their self-titled debut displays Better Days' strengths, which include three strong singers (Butterfield, Geoff Muldaur, and Ronnie Barron) and a more pastoral sensibility that's reflective of the setting of the recording--Woodstock, New York. When Butterfield's old band tackled ~Walkin' Blues~ on their groundbreaking sophomore release, East-West, they attacked it with Chicago-style aggression; Better Days' version of the same song is more relaxed and easy-flowing. It says a lot about Butterfield's shifting perspective that one of the nine-song collection's highlights is a tender ballad, ~Done a Lot of Wrong Things.~</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Steven Stolder</strong></p>",

The band's mix of various styles of blues, from rural (Robert Johnson), to cosmopolitan (Percy Mayfield), along with hints of New Orleans R&B, boogie woogie, and early rock and country, was tremendously out of step with the pop trends of its time.</p><p>These days, of course, there are many bands doing more or less the same thing (although rarely as well), but the fact that these guys couldn't have cared less about appearing trendy is one of the reasons why BETTER DAYS sounds timeless. Another reason, of course, is world class musicianship; Muldaur, Paul Butterfield, and stupendously stylish guitarist Amos Garrett in particular come across as both relaxed and passionate. Despite their essentially formalistic approach to music making, they never sound academic or sterile. BETTER DAYS is one of the great lost albums of the '70s.</p>"

		"lastname": "Pearl Jam",
		"name": "Pearl Jam",
		"biography": "<p>Pearl Jam rose from the ashes of Mother Love Bone to become the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s. After vocalist Andrew Wood overdosed on heroin in 1990, guitarist Stone Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament assembled a new band, bringing in Mike McCready on lead guitar and recording a demo with Soundgarden's Matt Cameron on drums. Thanks to future Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons, the demo found its way to a 25-year-old San Diego surfer named Eddie Vedder, who overdubbed vocals and original lyrics and was subsequently invited to join the band (then christened Mookie Blaylock after the NBA player). Dave Krusen was hired as the full-time drummer shortly thereafter, completing the original lineup. Renaming themselves Pearl Jam, the band recorded their debut album, <i>Ten</i>, in the beginning of 1991, although it wasn't released until August; in the meantime, the majority of the band appeared on the Andrew Wood tribute project Temple of the Dog. <i>Ten</i> didn't begin selling in significant numbers until early 1992, after Nirvana made mainstream rock radio receptive to alternative rock acts. Soon, Pearl Jam outsold Nirvana, which wasn't surprising -- Pearl Jam fused the riff-heavy stadium rock of the '70s with the grit and anger of '80s post-punk, without ever neglecting hooks and choruses; ~Jeremy,~ ~Evenflow,~ and ~Alive~ fit perfectly onto album rock radio stations looking for new blood.</p><p>Krusen left the band shortly after the release of <i>Ten</i>; he was replaced by Dave Abbruzzese. Pearl Jam's audience continued to grow during 1992, thanks to a series of radio and MTV hits, as well as successful appearances on the second Lollapalooza tour and the <i>Singles</i> soundtrack (Stone Gossard also embarked on a side project called Brad, which released the album <i>Shame</i> in early 1993). Despite their status as rock & roll superstars, the band refused to succumb to the accepted conventions of the music industry. The group refused to release any videos or singles from their second album, 1993's <i>Vs</i>. Nevertheless, it was another multi-platinum success, debuting at number one and selling nearly a million copies in its first week of release. On their spring 1994 American tour, the band decided not to play the conventional stadiums, choosing to play smaller arenas, including several shows on college campuses. Pearl Jam cancelled their 1994 summer tour, claiming they could not keep ticket prices below 20 dollars because Ticketmaster was pressuring promoters to charge a higher price. The band took Ticketmaster to the Justice Department for unfair business practices; while fighting Ticketmaster, they recorded a new album during the spring and summer of 1994. After the record was completed, the group fired Dave Abbruzzese, replacing him with former Red Hot Chili Peppers and Eleven drummer Jack Irons.</p><p><i>Vitalogy</i>, the band's third album, appeared at the end of 1994. For the first two weeks, the album was only available as a limited vinyl release, but the record charted in the Top 60. Once <i>Vitalogy</i> was available on CD and cassette, the album shot to the top of the charts and quickly went multi-platinum. Pearl Jam continued to battle Ticketmaster in 1995, but the Justice Department eventually ruled in favor of the ticket agency. In early 1995, the band recorded an album with Neil Young. Meanwhile, Vedder toured with his wife Beth's experimental band Hovercraft in the spring of 1994 as Stone Gossard founded an independent record company; Mad Season, Mike McCready's side project with Layne Staley of Alice in Chains, released their first album, <i>Above</i>, in the spring of 1995. Comprised entirely of Neil Young songs, <i>Mirror Ball</i> appeared in the summer under Young's name; although the individual members of the band were credited, the name Pearl Jam did not appear on the cover due to legal complications. Pearl Jam released a single culled from the sessions, titled <i>Merkinball</i> and featuring the songs ~I Got Id~ and ~Long Road,~ in the fall of 1995.</p><p>In late summer of 1996, Pearl Jam released their fourth album, <i>No Code</i>. Although the album was greeted with fairly positive reviews and debuted at number one, its weird amalgam of rock, worldbeat, and experimentalism dissatisfied a large portion of their fan base, and it quickly fell down the charts. The record's performance was also hurt by Pearl Jam's inability to launch a full-scale tour, due both to their battle with Ticketmaster and a reluctance to spend months on the road. The band spent most of 1997 out of the spotlight, working on new material; Gossard also released a second album with his side project Brad, titled <i>Interiors</i>. By the end of the year, Pearl Jam had completed a new, harder-rocking record entitled <i>Yield</i>. The album was greeted with enthusiastic reviews upon its February 1998 release, but its commercial fortunes weren't quite as clear cut. While their sizable cult embraced the album, sending it to number two its first week of release, <i>Yield</i> quickly slipped down the charts. Pearl Jam supported the record with a full-scale arena tour in the summer of 1998, issuing the concert LP <i>Live on Two Legs</i> at the end of the year; Jack Irons did not participate due to poor health, and was replaced by ex-Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. In 1999, Pearl Jam scored an unlikely pop radio smash with their cover of the J. Frank Wilson oldie ~Last Kiss,~ originally released as the seventh in a series of fan club-only singles that had also featured several incongruous covers in the past. Demand from fans and radio programmers resulted in the nationwide release of ~Last Kiss,~ and it eventually became the band's highest-charting pop hit to date, peaking at number two and going gold. The group returned in 2000 with the Tchad Blake-produced <i>Binaural</i>. In order to circumvent bootleggers, their subsequent European and American tours were recorded in full and released in an unprecedented series of double-CD sets, each of the 72 volumes featuring a complete concert.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b> ",

				"review": "<p>A strange phenomenon with anthemic hard rock bands is that when they begin to mature and branch out into new musical genres, they nearly always choose to embrace both the music and spirituality of the East and India, and Pearl Jam is no exception. Throughout No Code, Eddie Vedder expounds on his moral and spiritual dilemmas; where on previous albums his rage was virtually all-consuming, it is clear on No Code that he has embraced an unspecified religion as a way to ease his troubles. Fortunately, that has coincided with an expansion of the group's musical palette. From the subtle, winding opener, ~Sometimes,~ and the near-prayer of the single, ~Who You Are,~ the band reaches into new territory, working with droning, mantra-like riffs and vocals, layered exotic percussion, and a newfound subtlety. Of course, they haven't left behind hard rock, but like any Pearl Jam record, the heart of No Code doesn't lie in the harder songs, it lies in the slower numbers and the ballads, which give Vedder the best platform for his soul-searching: ~Present Tense,~ ~Off He Goes,~ ~In My Tree,~ and ~Around the Bend~ equal the group's earlier masterpieces. While a bit too incoherent, No Code is Pearl Jam's richest and most rewarding album to date as well as their most human. They might be maturing in a fairly conventional method, but they still find new ways to state old truths.</p><p><b>&mdash; Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b></p>"

				"review": "<p>Joe Strummer once claimed that the Clash had stardom in their hands, then they dropped it on the floor and broke it. Pearl Jam took the opposite tact: they purposely left stardom behind. Nirvana may have ushered in the age of grunge and alternative rock, but Pearl Jam were the biggest band in the land during the first half of the '90s, dominating radio airwaves, MTV, and college dorms alike. Most bands would have embraced such widespread acclaim, but the quintet bristled at this vein, and started to restlessly explore new musical territory, a move that eventually whittled their fan base down to just the hardcore by the beginning of the next decade. That hardcore following was still large, and the band could still have the occasional surprising crossover hit, like the 1999 cover of J. Frank Wilson's teen tragedy classic ~Last Kiss~ that went to number two on the Billboard charts, but they were no longer the biggest band in the land.</p><p>Spanning two discs, <i>Rearviewmirror</i> (Greatest Hits 1991-2003) chronicles that journey and it does an expert job not only of capturing the moment when Pearl Jam were monstrously popular, but proving that they still turned out good music even when they were fading from the spotlight. Unlike most career-spanning, multi-disc retrospectives, <i>Rearviewmirror</i> does not emphasize latter-day albums in order to achieve a sense of balance that's inherently phony. Of the 33 tracks, only 12 date from the post-<i>Vitalogy</i> era, which means that the bulk of the collection concentrates on their early-'90s heyday, and nearly every radio hit and concert staple is here, outside of the Victoria Williams cover ~Crazy Mary~ and ~Tremor Christ.~ While their presence would have been nice, they're not terribly missed, partially because such non-LP cuts like ~State of Love and Trust,~ ~I Got ID,~ ~Last Kiss,~ and ~Man of the Hour~ are collected here, but mainly because the compilation plays so well.</p><p>The songs are divided into the ~Up Side~ and ~Down Side,~ meaning the first disc has all the rockers and the second disc has all the ballads. At first, this seems like a questionable strategy, since it's usually preferable to have all the hits follow in chronological order, but what makes this work is that the songs on each disc are presented in chronological order, and they sustain their mood quite well (this is partially helped by Brendan O'Brien's new mixes of ~Once,~ ~Alive,~ and ~Black,~ which retain the feeling of the original songs but remove much of the dated glossy sheen in the production). Distilled to their hits and anthems, all of Pearl Jam's best qualities shine through and they sound bigger, better, and frankly more coherent than they do on their full-length albums. And that's why <i>Rearviewmirror</i> is a cut above most '90s hits collections: it not only gives casual fans all the hits, but it captures why the band mattered, while providing a better listen than their proper LPs in the process.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<p>Nearly 15 years after Ten, Pearl Jam finally returned to the strengths of their debut with 2006's Pearl Jam, a sharply focused set of impassioned hard rock. Gone are the arty detours (some call them affectations) that alternately cluttered and enhanced their albums from 1993's sophomore effort, Vs., all the way to 2002's Riot Act, and what's left behind is nothing but the basics: muscular, mildly meandering rock & roll, enlivened by Eddie Vedder's bracing sincerity. Pearl Jam has never sounded as hard or direct as they do here — even on Ten there was an elasticity to the music, due in large part to Jeff Ament's winding fretless bass, that kept the record from sounding like a direct hit to the gut, which Pearl Jam certainly does. Nowhere does it sound more forceful than it does in its first half, when the tightly controlled rockers ~Life Wasted,~ ~World Wide Suicide,~ ~Comatose,~ ~Severed Hand,~ and ~Marker in the Sand~ pile up on top of each other, giving the record a genuine feeling of urgency. That insistent quality and sense of purpose doesn't let up even as they slide into the quite beautiful, lightly psychedelic acoustic pop of ~Parachutes,~ which is when the album begins to open up slightly. If the second half of the record does have a greater variety of tempos than the first, it's still heavy on rockers, ranging from the ironic easy swagger of ~Unemployable~ to the furious ~Big Wave,~ which helps set the stage for the twin closers of ~Come Back~ and ~Inside Job.~ The former is a slow-burning cousin to ~Black~ that finds Pearl Jam seamlessly incorporating soul into their sound, while the latter is a deliberately escalating epic that gracefully closes the album on a hopeful note — and coming after an album filled with righteous anger and frustration, it is indeed welcome. But Pearl Jam's anger on this eponymous album is not only largely invigorating, it is the opposite of the tortured introspection of their first records. Here, Vedder turns his attention to the world at large, and while he certainly rages against the state of W's union in 2006, he's hardly myopic or strident; he's alternately evocative and specific, giving this album a resonance that has been lacking in most protest rock of the 2000s. But what makes Pearl Jam such an effective record is that it can be easily enjoyed as sheer music without ever digging into Vedder's lyrics. Song for song, this is their best set since Vitalogy, and the band has never sounded so purposeful on record as they do here, nor have they ever delivered a record as consistent as this. And the thing that makes the record work exceptionally well is that Pearl Jam has embraced everything they do well, whether it's their classicist hard rock or heart-on-sleeve humanitarianism. In doing so, they seem kind of old fashioned, reaffirming that they are now thoroughly outside of the mainstream — spending well over a decade galloping away from any trace of popularity will inevitably make you an outsider — but on their own terms, Pearl Jam hasn't sounded as alive or engaging as they do here since at least Vitalogy, if not longer.</p><P>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b></P>"

				"review": "<p>Pearl Jam made peace with their hard rock past on their eponymous eighth album, but its 2009 sequel, Backspacer, is where the group really gets back to basics, bringing in old cohort Brendan O'Brien to produce for the first time since 1998's Yield. To a certain extent, the band has reached the point in its career where every move, every cranked amp, every short tough song is heralded as a return to form -- call it the Stones syndrome -- and so it is with Backspacer, whose meaty riffs have no less vigor than those of Pearl Jam; they're just channeled into a brighter, cheerier package. Despite this lighter spirit, Pearl Jam remain the antithesis of lighthearted good-time rock & roll -- they're convinced rock & roll is a calling, not a diversion -- but there's a tonal shift from the clenched anger that's marked their music of the new millennium, a transition from the global toward the personal. Ironically, by looking within the music opens up, as the group isn't fighting against the dying light but embracing how this most classicist of alt-rock bands is an anachronism in 2009. Of course, Pearl Jam were an anachronism even back in 1992, worshiping the Who instead of the Stooges, but this odd out-of-phase devotion to the ideals of post-hippie, pre-punk rock is better suited to bandmembers in their forties than in their twenties; fashion has passed them by several times over, leaving Pearl Jam just to be who they are, comfortable in their weathering skin. Pearl Jam battled their success for so long, intent on whittling their audience down to the devout, that it often felt like a chore to keep pace with the band because no matter the merit of the records, they always felt like heavy lifting, but that's no longer the case: here, as on the self-titled 2006 album, it sounds as if they enjoy being in a band, intoxicated by the noise they make. This means, all things considered, Backspacer is a party record for Pearl Jam -- a party that might consist of nothing but philosophical debates till the wee hours, but a party nonetheless -- and if 18 years is a long, long wait for a band to finally throw a party, it's also true that, prior to Backspacer, Pearl Jam wouldn't or couldn't have made music this unfettered, unapologetically assured, casual, and, yes, fun.

				"review": "<DIV align=left><B>THE GOLDBERG VARIATIONS AND MURRAY PERAHIA<BR></B><BR>Bach described the Goldberg Variations, his seemingly innocent tune followed by thirty variations, merely as a keyboard ~practice-piece,~ composed for his talented protégé Johann Gottlieb Goldberg to play on the harpsichord. But this scholarly exercise demands the kind of virtuoso skills to strike fear in the heart of any keyboard performer. Dexterity, speed, lightness of touch, dazzling independent fingerwork and, ultimately, deeply felt musicianship are essential ingredients of a reading. In addition, the passion and drama in Bach's music must be readily tangible.<BR><BR>The Goldberg Variations remained for many years a greatly admired but often avoided masterpiece. Over-respectful scholarship and careful musicianship had made it into one of those Great Works that few players were anxious to perform in public and only dedicated listeners really wanted to hear. Then, in 1955, an interpretation by the then-virtually-unknown pianist Glenn Gould forced musicians and listeners, fans and critics alike, to reassess Bach's monumental achievement. And now, nearly half a century later, Murray Perahia, unquestionably one of the greatest pianists of his generation, gives his own reading of this cornerstone work.<BR><BR>As the producer of some of Murray Perahia's early recordings, more than twenty years ago, it is hard to describe how heartwarming it is to hear the joy, pathos, audacity, drama, triumph, thoughtful reflection, and breathtaking virtuosity he brings to his deeply musical interpretation of this great work, helping to remind us why music is the most moving of all the arts.<BR><BR><B>Paul Myers</B> <BR><BR><B><BR>SOME THOUGHTS ON THE GOLDBERG VARIATIONS</B></DIV><BR>Playing the wonderfully varied, colorful and emotionally differentiated pieces that make up the Goldberg Variations is one of the most challenging experiences a pianist can face. Through all the joys or disappointments, the enthusiasms or frustrations that one goes through in learning the music, an overriding question always presents itself: How does so much invention, so much fantasy and imagination come from such a simple-seeming 32-bar aria based on a ~Fundamental Bass~? After all, what is this Fundamental Bass, as Bach called it, but a series of chords, and not very complicated ones at that? Part of this question can never be answered because in a way it would be like defining genius, and what's more, a particular genius, Bach. Part of it, though, every pianist must answer for himself or herself, and this is my attempt to explain some of the things that were important to me.<BR><BR>First, I think, one must take a closer look at the chords of the ~Fundamental Bass~ because the inspiration for the entire piece is found in the accumulation and release of tension by the harmonies of these very chords. And certainly harmony was of crucial importance to Bach. In 1737, after Johann Adolph Scheibe had written a criticism of Bach's vocal music, claiming the compositions were deprived of their ~natural element by a turgid and confused style,~ Bach circulated a reply written by his friend Johann Abraham Birnbaum, defending the complexity of many voices when they serve to bolster or clarify the harmony. As Birnbaum wrote: ~Music consists of harmony, and harmony becomes far more complete if all the voices collaborate to form it.~ Seen from this point of view, these chords are the result of all the voices participating in and unfolding their tensions.<BR><BR>Below is a reduction showing the harmonic plan of the entire Aria (figure 1).<BR><BR><CENTER><IMG height=135 alt=~figure 1~ src=~http://www.sonyclassical.com/music/89243/gfx/notes-1.gif~ width=475 border=0></CENTER><BR><BR>Though, quite naturally, the bass line leads and directs the general movement of the Aria, the top voice, or soprano, as the most exposed member, is an important contributor and not just incidental. The movement of the bass from G to D is answered by the soprano, traversing a fifth from d to g, a process delayed for a considerable time by its going to its own neighboring or auxiliary tone e2. The tension caused by these different forces creates the harmonies that we hear.<BR><BR>The structural chords of the Fundamental Bass are delineated in greater detail below (figure 2), with the numbers under the bass notes suggesting the movement of the other voices.<BR><BR><CENTER><IMG height=299 alt=~figure 2~ src=~http://www.sonyclassical.com/music/89243/gfx/notes-2.gif~ width=515 border=0></CENTER><BR><BR>As can be seen, the first 8 bars only define the tonic key (G Major), but in the next eight bars the music explores what seems to be the key of the dominant (D Major). After the double bar, the tension is driven a step further (quite literally, a step above D to E Minor). Here three voices take the place of the usual four, and the effect is more sorrowful than anything experienced thus far in the Aria. Finally, and most touching of all, in the last eight bars, the harmony returns to the tonic.<BR><BR><IMG height=57 alt=~figure 3~ hspace=12 src=~http://www.sonyclassical.com/music/89243/gfx/notes-3.gif~ width=151 align=right vspace=4 border=0>Through the activity of the top voice in measures 25 to 27 (figure 3), we can see how the melody moves from e2 down to d2 and on to c2. At that point, measure 23, the motion is speeded up (everything is in semi-quavers to the very end), and the melody rises ever upward, delaying yet again its need to descend to g1 and transfiguring its return to the tonic. In a kind of extra-musical analysis, it is as if the melody were reaching for heaven before coming to rest on earth.<BR><BR>One reason I have dealt at length with the Aria is because it serves as the structural blueprint for the entire Goldberg Variations. Not only does the foregoing plan hold true for each of the Variations, despite their complex counterpoint and intricate canons, but the movement of the Aria is reflected in the progression of all the 32 pieces that make up the Goldberg Variations -- from the Aria through its 30 variations to its restatement.<BR><BR>Much has been made in the past of the importance of the number 3 in the Variations (for instance, a canon occurs every three variations). While that is true, I feel that the number 8 is more significant in terms of the dramatic contents. Thus, the division of the Aria into 8-bar sections with an overall caesura at the double-bar (after measure sixteen) is reflected in the structure of the whole piece. Counting the Aria as number one, the first break occurs after the eighth piece played, Variation 7, which is marked ~tempo di giga~ (Bach's own designation in the Handexemplar), a dance that always ends suites. The equivalent medial break in the Aria at measure 16 is mirrored in the Variations by a medial break after Variation 15, the sixteenth piece played. Indeed, Variation 16 signals a new beginning with a French Ouverture and accompanying fughetta.<BR><BR>When we reach Variation 24, a calming, pastoral canon at the octave, it is as if the piece were entering its final phase. After all, we should not be expecting more canons since intervals after the octave will be the same (i.e., the ninth equals the second, the tenth equals the third, and so on). Still, Bach surprises us with more canonic pieces -- the canon at the ninth and the Quodlibet -- but they will be part of the larger drama that ensues. Variation 24 along with Variation 25 are like the 25th and 26th measures of the Aria, the turning point. Indeed, with Variation 25, the temperature changes completely. The semitoned intensity of this darkly chromatic piece, the minor key, the desperate and anguished mood-- all these help to create what seems to be a programmatic depiction of the Crucifixion or, at the very least, of the deathly atmosphere it evokes.<BR><BR>After this and until the Quodlibet, all the pieces seem to have a headlong drive, much like the motion in semiquavers we noticed at the equivalent point in the Aria. The programmatic analysis here would be of the Resurrection: Variation 26, ascends like a soul in flight; Variation 27, an unaccompanied canon on the ninth, caught up in this same movement, is like two voices talking animatedly, perhaps even in mocking tones; Variation 28, with its very high register and shimmering trills is all transcendence; Variation 29 brings these trills back down to earth and to glory.<BR><BR>Finally, in Variation 30, the Quodlibet, with its earthy folk songs and animated rustic feel, comes the climax, and the accumulated motion of these last variations is at last released. The Quodlibet is a climax in many ways, in that while not a strict canon itself, it sums up the idea of canonic imitation in the most compositionally virtuosic manner. The Variations come to their final resolution with the restatement of the Aria. These noble, radiant lines bring the music to rest. Indeed its simplicity belies the complexity in this most moving of musical apotheoses.<BR><BR><B>Murray Perahia</B>"

Waters spins this off into a treatise on the futility of war, concentrating on the Falkland Islands, setting his blistering condemnations and scathing anger to impossibly subdued music that demands full attention. This is more like a novel than a record, requiring total concentration since shifts in dynamics, orchestration, and instrumentation are used as effect. This means that while this has the texture of classic Pink Floyd, somewhere between the brooding sections of The Wall and the monolithic menace of Animals, there are no songs or hooks to make these radio favorites. The even bent of the arrangements, where the music is used as texture, not music, means that The Final Cut purposely alienates all but the dedicated listener. Several of those listeners maintain that this is among Pink Floyd's finest efforts, and it certainly is an achievement of some kind — there's not only no other Floyd album quite like it, it has no close comparisons to anybody else's work (apart from Waters' own The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, yet that had a stronger musical core). That doesn't make this easier to embrace, of course, and it's damn near impenetrable in many respects, but with its anger, emphasis on lyrics, and sonic textures, it's clear that it's the album that Waters intended it to be. And it's equally clear that Pink Floyd couldn't have continued in this direction — Waters had no interest in a group setting anymore, as this record, which is hardly a Floyd album in many respects, illustrates. Distinctive, to be sure, but not easy to love and, depending on your view, not even that easy to admire. [The Final Cut was reissued in a remastered edition in 2004. This edition added ~When the Tigers Broke Free~ — originally heard in the soundtrack to The Wall, but its moody, war-obsessed soundscape is better suited for The Final Cut — as the fourth track, inserted between ~One of the Few~ and ~The Hero's Return,~ where it fits nicely into the album's narrative.]</P><P>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B></P>"

		"firstname": "Elvis",
		"lastname": "Presley",
		"name": "Elvis Presley",
		"biography": "<P>Elvis Presley may be the single most important figure in American 20th century popular music. Not necessarily the best, and certainly not the most consistent. But no one could argue with the fact that he was the musician most responsible for popularizing rock &amp; roll on an international level. Viewed in cold sales figures, his impact was phenomenal. Dozens upon dozens of international smashes from the mid-'50s to the mid-'70s, as well as the steady sales of his catalog and reissues since his death in 1977, may make him the single highest-selling performer in history.</P><P>More important from a music lover's perspective, however, are his remarkable artistic achievements. Presley was not the very first white man to sing rhythm &amp; blues; Bill Haley predated him in that regard, and there may have been others as well. Elvis was certainly the first, however, to assertively fuse country and blues music into the style known as rockabilly. While rockabilly arrangements were the foundations of his first (and possibly best) recordings, Presley could not have become a mainstream superstar without a much more varied palette that also incorporated pop, gospel, and even some bits of bluegrass and operatic schmaltz here and there. His 1950s recordings established the basic language of rock &amp; roll; his explosive and sexual stage presence set standards for the music's visual image; his vocals were incredibly powerful and versatile.</P><P>Unfortunately, to much of the public, Elvis is more icon than artist. Innumerable bad Hollywood movies, increasingly caricatured records and mannerisms, and a personal life that became steadily more sheltered from real-world concerns (and steadily more bizarre) gave his story a somewhat mythic status. By the time of his death, he'd become more a symbol of gross Americana than of cultural innovation. The continued speculation about his incredible career has sustained interest in his life, and supported a large tourist/entertainment industry, that may last indefinitely, even if the fascination is fueled more by his celebrity than his music.</P><P>Born to a poor Mississippi family in the heart of Depression, Elvis had moved to Memphis by his teens, where he absorbed the vibrant melting pot of Southern popular music in the form of blues, country, bluegrass, and gospel. After graduating from high school, he became a truck driver, rarely if ever singing in public. Some 1953 and 1954 demos, recorded at the emerging Sun label in Memphis primarily for Elvis' own pleasure, helped stir interest on the part of Sun owner Sam Phillips. In mid-1954, Phillips, looking for a white singer with a black feel, teamed Presley with guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black. Almost by accident, apparently, the trio hit upon a version of an Arthur Crudup blues tune, ~That's All Right Mama,~ that became Elvis' first single.</P><P>Elvis' five Sun singles pioneered the blend of R&amp;B and C&amp;W that would characterize rockabilly music. For quite a few scholars, they remain not only Elvis' best singles, but the best rock &amp; roll ever recorded. Claiming that Elvis made blues acceptable for the white market is not the whole picture; the singles usually teamed blues covers with country and pop ones, all made into rock &amp; roll (at this point a term that barely existed) with the pulsing beat, slap-back echo, and Elvis' soaring, frenetic vocals. ~That's All Right Mama,~ ~Blue Moon of Kentucky,~ ~Good Rockin' Tonight,~ ~Baby Let's Play House,~ and ~Mystery Train~ remain core early rock classics.</P><P>The singles sold well in the Memphis area immediately, and by 1955 were starting to sell well to country audiences throughout the South. Presley, Moore, and Black hit the road with a stage show that grew ever wilder and more provocative, Elvis' swiveling hips causing enormous controversy. The move to all-out rock was hastened by the addition of drums. The last Sun single, ~I Forgot to Remember Forget~/~Mystery Train,~ hit number one on the national country charts in late 1955. Presley was obviously a performer with superstar potential, attracting the interest of bigger labels and Colonel Tom Parker, who became Elvis' manager. In need of capital to expand the Sun label, Sam Phillips sold Presley's contract to RCA in late 1955 for 35,000 dollars; a bargain, when viewed in hindsight, but an astronomical sum at the time.</P><P>This is the point where musical historians start to diverge in opinion. For many, the whole of his subsequent work for RCA -- encompassing over 20 years -- was a steady letdown, never recapturing the pure, primal energy that was harnessed so effectively on the handful of Sun singles. Elvis, however, was not a purist. What he wanted, more than anything, was to be successful. To do that, his material needed more of a pop feel; in any case, he'd never exactly been one to disparage the mainstream, naming Dean Martin as one of his chief heroes from the get-go. At RCA, his rockabilly was leavened with enough pop flavor to make all of the charts, not just the country ones.</P><P>At the beginning, at least, the results were hardly any tamer than the Sun sessions. ~Heartbreak Hotel,~ his first single, rose to number one and, aided by some national television appearances, helped make Elvis an instant superstar. ~I Want You, I Need You, I Love You~ was a number one follow-up; the double-sided monster ~Hound Dog~/~Don't Be Cruel~ was one of the biggest-selling singles the industry had ever experienced up to that point. Albums and EPs were also chart-toppers, not just in the U.S., but throughout the world. The 1956 RCA recordings, while a bit more sophisticated in production and a bit less rootsy in orientation than his previous work, were still often magnificent, rating among the best and most influential recordings of early rock &amp; roll.</P><P>Elvis' (and Colonel Parker's) aspirations were too big to be limited to records and live appearances. By late 1956, his first Hollywood movie, Love Me Tender, had been released; other screen vehicles would follow in the next few years, Jailhouse Rock being the best. The hits continued unabated, several of them (~Jailhouse Rock,~ ~All Shook Up,~ ~Too Much~) excellent, and often benefiting from the efforts of top early rock songwriter Otis Blackwell, as well as the emerging team of Jerry Leiber-Mike Stoller. The Jordanaires added both pop and gospel elements with their smooth backup vocals.</P><P>Yet worrisome signs were creeping in. The Dean Martin influence began rearing his head in smoky, sentimental ballads such as ~Loving You~; the vocal swoops became more exaggerated and stereotypical, although the overall quality of his output remained high. And although Moore and Black continued to back Elvis on his early RCA recordings, within a few years the musicians had gone their own ways.</P><P>Presley's recording and movie careers were interrupted by his induction into the Army in early 1958. There was enough material in the can to flood the charts throughout his two-year absence (during which he largely served in Germany). When he re-entered civilian life in 1960, his popularity, remarkably, was at just as high a level as when he left.</P><P>One couldn't, unfortunately, say the same for the quality of his music, which was not just becoming more sedate, but was starting to either repeat itself, or opt for operatic ballads that didn't have a whole lot to do with rock. Elvis' rebellious, wild image had been tamed to a large degree as well, as he and Parker began designing a career built around Hollywood films. Shortly after leaving the Army, in fact, Presley gave up live performing altogether for nearly a decade to concentrate on movie-making. The films, in turn, would serve as vehicles to both promote his records and to generate maximum revenue with minimal effort. For the rest of the '60s, Presley ground out two or three movies a year that, while mostly profitable, had little going for them in the way of story, acting, or social value.</P><P>While there were some quality efforts on Presley's early-'60s albums, his discography was soon dominated by forgettable soundtracks, mostly featuring material that was dispensable or downright ridiculous. In time he became largely disinterested in devoting much time to his craft in the studio. The soundtrack LPs themselves were sometimes filled out with outtakes that had been in the can for years (and these, sadly, were often the highlights of the albums). There were some good singles in the early '60s, like ~Return to Sender~; once in a while there was even a flash of superb, tough rock, like ~Little Sister~ or ~(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame.~ But by 1963 or so there was little to get excited about, although he continued to sell in large quantities.</P><P>The era spanning, roughly, 1962-1967 has generated a school of Elvis apologists, eager to wrestle any kernel of quality that emerged from his recordings during this period. They also point out that Presley was assigned poor material, and assert that Colonel Parker was largely responsible for Presley's emasculation. True to a point, but on the other hand it could be claimed, with some validity, that Presley himself was doing little to rouse himself from his artistic stupor, letting Parker destroy his artistic credibility without much apparent protest, and holing up in his large mansion with a retinue of yes-men that protected their benefactor from much day-to-day contact with a fast-changing world.</P><P>The Beatles, all big Elvis fans, displaced Presley as the biggest rock act in the world in 1964. What's more, they did so by writing their own material and playing their own instruments; something Elvis had never been capable of, or particularly aspired to. They, and the British and American groups the Beatles influenced, were not shy about expressing their opinions, experimenting musically, and taking the reins of their artistic direction into their own hands. The net effect was to make Elvis Presley, still churning out movies in Hollywood as psychedelia and soul music became the rage, seem irrelevant, even as he managed to squeeze out an obscure Dylan cover (~Tomorrow Is a Long Time~) on a 1966 soundtrack album.</P><P>By 1967 and 1968, there were slight stirrings of an artistic reawakening by Elvis. Singles like ~Guitar Man,~ ~Big Boss Man,~ and ~U.S. Male,~ though hardly classics, were at least genuine rock &amp; roll that sounded better than much of what he'd been turning out for years. A 1968 television special gave Presley the opportunity he needed to reinvent himself as an all-out leather-coated rocker, still capable of magnetizing an audience, and eager to revisit his blues and country roots.</P><P>The 1968 album Elvis in Memphis was the first LP in nearly a decade in which Presley seemed cognizant of current trends, as he updated his sounds with contemporary compositions and touches of soul to create some reasonably gutsy late-'60s pop/rock. This material, and 1969 hits like ~Suspicious Minds~ and ~In the Ghetto,~ returned him to the top of the charts. Arguably, it's been overrated by critics, who were so glad to have him singing rock again that they weren't about to carp about the slickness of some of the production, or the mediocrity of some of the songwriting.</P><P>But Elvis' voice did sound good, and he returned to live performing in 1969, breaking in with weeks of shows in Las Vegas. This was followed by national tours that proved him to still be an excellent live entertainer, even if the exercises often reeked of show-biz extravaganza. (Elvis never did play outside of North America and Hawaii, possibly because Colonel Parker, it was later revealed, was an illegal alien who could have faced serious problems if he traveled abroad.) Hollywood was history, but studio and live albums were generated at a rapid pace, usually selling reasonably well, although Presley never had a Top Ten hit after 1972's ~Burning Love.~</P><P>Presley's 1970s recordings, like most of his '60s work, are the focus of divergent critical opinion. Some declare them to be, when Elvis was on, the equal of anything he did, especially in terms of artistic diversity. It's true that the material was pretty eclectic, running from country to blues to all-out rock to gospel (Presley periodically recorded gospel-only releases, going all the way back to 1957). At the same time, his vocal mannerisms were often stilted, and the material -- though not nearly as awful as that '60s soundtrack filler -- sometimes substandard. Those who are not serious Elvis fans will usually find this late-period material to hold only a fraction of the interest of his '50s classics.</P><P>Elvis' final years have been the subject of a cottage industry of celebrity bios, tell-alls, and gossip screeds from those who knew him well, or (more likely) purported to know him well. Those activities are really beyond the scope of a mini-bio such as this, but it's enough to note that his behavior was becoming increasingly instable. His weight fluctuated wildly; his marriage broke up; he became dependent upon a variety of prescription drugs. Worst of all, he became isolated from the outside world except for professional purposes (he continued to tour until the end), rarely venturing outside of his Graceland mansion in Memphis. Colonel Parker's financial decisions on behalf of his client have also come in for much criticism.</P><P>On August 16, 1977, Presley was found dead in Graceland. The cause of death remains a subject of widespread speculation, although it seems likely that drugs played a part. An immediate cult (if cult is the way to describe millions of people) sprang up around his legacy, kept alive by the hundreds of thousands of visitors who make the pilgrimage to Graceland annually. Elvis memorabilia, much of it kitsch, is another industry in his own right. Dozens if not hundreds make a comfortable living by impersonating the King in live performance. And then there are all those Elvis sightings, reported in tabloids on a seemingly weekly basis.</P><P>Although Presley had recorded a mammoth quantity of both released and unreleased material for RCA, the label didn't show much interest in repackaging it with the respect due such a pioneer. Haphazard collections of outtakes and live performances were far rarer than budget reissues and countless repackagings of the big hits. In the CD age, RCA finally began to treat the catalog with some of the reverence it deserved, at long last assembling a box set containing nearly all of the 1950s recordings. Similar, although less exciting, box sets were documenting the 1960s, the 1970s, and his soundtrack recordings. And exploitative reissues of Elvis material continue to appear constantly, often baited with one or two rare outtakes or alternates to entice the completists (of which there are many). In death, as in life, Presley continues to be one of RCA's most consistent earners. Fortunately, with a little discretion, a good Elvis library can be built with little duplication, sticking largely to the most highly recommended selections.</P>— <B>Richie Unterberger</B>",

		"name": "John Prine",
		"biography": "<p>An acclaimed singer/songwriter whose literate work flirted with everything from acoustic folk to rockabilly to straight-ahead country, John Prine was born October 10, 1946, in Maywood, Illinois. Raised by parents firmly rooted in their rural Kentucky background, at age 14 Prine began learning to play the guitar from his older brother while taking inspiration from his grandfather, who had played with Merle Travis. After a two-year tenure in the U.S. Army, Prine became a fixture on the Chicago folk music scene in the late '60s, befriending another young performer named Steve Goodman.</p><p>Diamonds in the RoughPrine's compositions caught the ear of Kris Kristofferson, who was instrumental in helping him win a recording contract. In 1971, he went to Memphis to record his eponymously titled debut album; though not a commercial success, songs like ~Sam Stone,~ the harsh tale of a drug-addled Vietnam veteran, won critical approval. Neither 1972's Diamonds in the Rough nor 1973's Sweet Revenge fared any better on the charts, but Prine's work won great renown among his fellow performers; the Everly Brothers covered his song ~Paradise,~ while both Bette Midler and Joan Baez offered renditions of ~Hello in There.~</p><p>Common Sense For 1975's Common Sense, Prine turned to producer Steve Cropper, the highly influential house guitarist for the Stax label; while the album's sound shocked the folk community with its reliance on husky vocals and booming drums, it served notice that Prine was not an artist whose work could be pigeonholed, and was his only LP to reach the U.S. Top 100. Steve Goodman took over the reins for 1978's folky Bruised Orange, but on 1979's Pink Cadillac, Prine took another left turn and recorded an electric rockabilly workout produced at Sun Studios by the label's legendary founder Sam Phillips, and his son Knox.</p><p>Storm Windows Following 1980's Storm Windows, Prine was dropped by Asylum, and he responded by forming his own label, Oh Boy Records, with the help of longtime manager Al Bunetta. The label's first release was 1984's Aimless Love, and under his own imprint, Prine's music thrived, as 1986's country-flavored German Afternoons earned a Grammy nomination in the Contemporary Folk category. After 1988's John Prine Live, he released 1991's Grammy-winning The Missing Years; co-produced by Howie Epstein of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers, the album featured guest appearances from Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt, and Tom Petty and proved to be Prine's biggest commercial success to date, selling nearly 250,000 copies. After making his film debut in 1992's John Mellencamp-directed Falling from Grace, Prine returned in 1995 with Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings, also produced by Epstein, which earned him another Grammy nomination.</p><p>In Spite of Ourselves In 1998, while Prine was working on an album of male/female country duets, he was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, with the cancer forming on the right side of his neck. Prine underwent surgery and radiation treatment for the cancer, and in 1999 was well enough to complete the album, which was released as In Spite of Ourselves and featured contributions from Emmylou Harris, Lucinda Williams, Trisha Yearwood, Patty Loveless, Connie Smith, and more. In 2000, Prine re-recorded 15 of his best-known songs (partly to give his voice a workout following his treatment, but primarily so Oh Boy would own recordings of his earlier hits) for an album called Souvenirs, originally issued in Germany but later released in the United States. In 2005, he released Fair & Square, a collection of new songs, followed by a concert tour. Two years later, alongside singer and guitarist Mac Wiseman, Prine issued Standard Songs for Average People, a collection of the two musicians' interpretations of 14 folk and country classics. In Person & on Stage, a collection of performances from various concert tours, appeared in 2010.</p><p>For Better or Worse In 2016, Prine issued a follow-up to In Spite of Ourselves titled For Better, Or Worse, another set of duet performances of classic country tunes. This time around, Prine's vocal partners included Kacey Musgraves, Alison Krauss, Miranda Lambert, Susan Tedeschi, Lee Ann Womack, Kathy Mattea, and Prine's frequent collaborator Iris DeMent.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jason Ankeny</strong></p>",

It's not as uniformly brilliant as the debut, but it did steer his music in a new direction -- where that record is often hallmarked for its rich sensitivity, Sweet Revenge established cynicism as Prine's dominant voice once and for all. Although he could still crank out a great ballad when he felt like it, from now on his records largely followed a more conventional rock & roll muse, a choice that eventually gained him more mainstream attention. ~Please Don't Bury Me,~ ~Christmas in Prison,~ ~Blue Umbrella,~ and ~A Good Time~ are a few of the jewels on this one.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jim Smith</strong></p>"

One reviewer referred to the album as Prine's ~best-sounding record,~ but one could argue that the production removes a great deal of the singer/songwriter's rough charm. While earlier albums like Diamonds in the Rough (1972) had seemed almost non-produced, Bruised Orange (1978) found the perfect balance between gruff and professional. Storm Windows isn't a bad album, but the songs and ~studio musician~ production lack the bite of Bruised Orange. The five-minute title track digs deepest, with Prine offering lovely lines like ~And down the beach the sandman sleeps/Time don't fly it bounds and leaps.~ One has to wonder, however, if lyrics like ~The spirits were high, til' the well went dry~ are autobiographical. Both ~Storm Windows~ and ~Sleepy Eyed Boy~ hint at disillusionment, as though an older Prine is looking back at his younger self. In this way, Storm Windows seems more confessional than early efforts like Sweet Revenge (1973). Other catchy pieces like ~Shop Talk~ and ~Just Wanna Be With You~ rock harder, but they're more or less throwaways. While Storm Windows captures Prine on autopilot, fans will enjoy listening to his reflections at this transitional stage.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr.</strong></p>"

		"biography": "<p>R.E.M. mark the point when post-punk turned into alternative rock. When their first single, ~Radio Free Europe,~ was released in 1981, it sparked a back-to-the-garage movement in the American underground. While there were a number of hardcore and punk bands in the U.S. during the early '80s, R.E.M. brought guitar pop back into the underground lexicon. Combining ringing guitar hooks with mumbled, cryptic lyrics and a D.I.Y. aesthetic borrowed from post-punk, the band simultaneously sounded traditional and modern. Though there were no overt innovations in their music, R.E.M. had an identity and sense of purpose that transformed the American underground. Throughout the '80s, they worked relentlessly, releasing records every year and touring constantly, playing both theaters and backwoods dives. Along the way, they inspired countless bands, from the legions of jangle pop groups in the mid-'80s to scores of alternative pop groups in the '90s, who admired their slow climb to stardom. It did take R.E.M. several years to break into the top of the charts, but they had a cult following from the release of their debut EP, Chronic Town, in 1982. Chronic Town established the haunting folk and garage rock that became the band's signature sound, and over the next five years, they continued to expand their music with a series of critically acclaimed albums. By the late '80s, the group's fan base had grown large enough to guarantee strong sales, but the Top Ten success in 1987 of Document and ~The One I Love~ was unexpected, especially since R.E.M. had only altered their sound slightly. Following Document, R.E.M. slowly became one of the world's most popular bands. After an exhaustive international tour supporting 1988's <i>Green</i>, the band retired from touring for six years and retreated into the studio to produce their most popular records, <i>Out of Time</i> (1991) and <i>Automatic for the People</i> (1992). By the time they returned to performing with the <i>Monster</i> tour in 1995, the band had been acknowledged by critics and musicians as one of  the forefathers of the thriving alternative rock movement, and they were rewarded with the most lucrative tour of their career. Toward the late '90s, R.E.M. was an institution, as its influence was felt in new generations of bands. </p><p>Though R.E.M. formed in Athens, GA, in 1980, Mike Mills (born December 17, 1958) and Bill Berry (born July 31, 1958) were the only Southerners in the group. Both had attended high school together in Macon, playing in a number of bands during their teens. Michael Stipe (born January 4, 1960) was a military brat, moving throughout the country during his childhood. By his teens, he had discovered punk rock through Patti Smith, Television, and Wire, and began playing in cover bands in St. Louis. By 1978, he had begun studying art at the University of Georgia in Athens, where he began frequenting the Wuxtry record store. Peter Buck (born December 6, 1956), a native of California, was a clerk at Wuxtry. Buck had been a fanatical record collector, consuming everything from classic rock to punk and free jazz, and was just beginning to learn how to play guitar. Discovering they had similar tastes, Buck and Stipe began working together, eventually meeting Berry and Mills through a mutual friend. In April of 1980, the band formed to play a party for their friend, rehearsing a number of garage, psychedelic bubblegum, and punk covers in an converted Episcopalian church. At the time, the group was played under the name the Twisted Kites. By the summer, the band had settled on the name R.E.M. after flipping randomly through the dictionary, and had met Jefferson Holt, who became their manager after witnessing the group's first out-of-state concert in North Carolina.</p><p>Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the South, playing a variety of garage rock covers and folk-rock originals. At the time, the band was still learning how to play, as Buck began to develop his distinctive, arpeggiated jangle and Stipe ironed out his cryptic lyrics. During the summer of 1981, R.E.M. recorded their first single, ~Radio Free Europe,~ at Mitch Easter's Drive-In Studios. Released on the local indie label Hib-Tone, ~Radio Free Europe~ was pressed in a run of only 1,000 copies, but most of the those singles fell into the right hands. Due to strong word of mouth, the single became a hit on college radio and topped the Village Voice's year-end poll of Best Independent Singles. The single also earned the attention of larger independent labels, and by the beginning of 1982, the band had signed to I.R.S. Records, releasing the EP Chronic Town in the spring. Like the single, Chronic Town was well received, paving the way for the group's full-length debut album, 1983's <i>Murmur</i>.</p><p>With its subdued, haunting atmosphere and understated production, <i>Murmur</i> was noticeably different than Chronic Town and was welcomed with enthusiastic reviews upon its spring release; Rolling Stone named it the best album of 1983, beating out Michael Jackson's <i>Thriller</i> and the Police's <i>Synchronicity</i>. <i>Murmur</i> also expanded the group's cult significantly, breaking into the American Top 40. R.E.M. returned to a rougher-edged sound on 1984's <i>Reckoning</i>, which featured the college hit ~So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry).~ By the time the band hit the road to support Reckoning, they had become well known in the American underground for their constant touring, aversion to videos, support of college radio, Stipe's mumbled vocals and detatched stage presence, Buck's ringing guitar, and their purposely enigmatic artwork. Bands that imitated these very things ran rampant throughout the American underground, and R.E.M. threw their support toward these bands, having them open at shows and mentioning them in interviews. By 1985, the American underground was awash with R.E.M. sound-alikes and bands like Game Theory and the Rain Parade, which shared similar aesthetics and sounds.</p><p>Just as the signature R.E.M. sound dominated the underground, the band entered darker territory with its third album, 1985's <i>Fables of the Reconstruction</i>. Recorded in London with producer Joe Boyd (Richard Thompson, Fairport Convention, Nick Drake), <i>Fables of the Reconstruction</i> was made at a difficult period in R.E.M.'s history, as the band was fraught with tension produced by endless touring. The album reflected the group's dark moods, as well as its obsession with the rural South, and both of these fascinations popped up on the supporting tour. Stipe, whose on-stage behavior was always slightly strange, entered his most bizarre phase, as he put on weight, dyed his hair bleached blonde, and wore countless layers of clothing. None of the new quirks in R.E.M.'s persona prevented <i>Fables of the Reconstruction</i> from becoming their most successful album to date, selling nearly 300,000 copies in the U.S. R.E.M. decided to record their next album with Don Gehman, who had previously worked with John Mellencamp. Gehman had the band clean up its sound and Stipe enunciate his vocals, making <i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i> their most accessible record to date. Upon its late summer release in 1986, <i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i> was greeted with the positive reviews that had become customary with each new R.E.M. album, and it outstripped the sales of its predecessor. Several months after <i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i>, the group released the B-sides and rarities collection <i>Dead Letter Office</i> in the spring of 1987.</p><p>R.E.M. had laid the groundwork for mainstream success, but they had never explicitly courted widespread success. Nevertheless, their audience had grown quite large, and it wasn't that surprising that the group's fifth album, <i>Document</i>, became a hit shortly after its fall 1987 release. Produced by Scott Litt -- who would produce all of their records over the course of the next decade -- <i>Document</i> climbed into the U.S. Top Ten and went platinum on the strength of the single ~The One I Love,~ which also went into the Top Ten; it also became their biggest U.K. hit to date, reaching the British Top 40. The following year, the band left I.R.S. Records, signing with Warner Bros. for a reported six million dollars. The first album under the new contract was <i>Green</i>, which was released on election day 1988. Green continued the success of <i>Document</i>, going double platinum and generating the Top Ten single ~Stand.~ R.E.M. supported <i>Green</i> with an exhaustive international tour, in which they played their first stadium dates in the U.S. Though they had graduated to stadiums in America, the group continued to play clubs throughout Europe. </p><p>The <i>Green</i> tour proved to be draining for the group, and they took an extended rest upon its completion in 1989. During the break, each member pursued side projects, and <i>Hindu Love Gods</i>, an album Buck, Berry, and Mills recorded with Warren Zevon in 1986, was released. R.E.M. reconvened during 1990 to record their seventh album, <i>Out of Time</i>, which was released in the spring of 1991. Entering the U.S. and U.K. charts at number one, <i>Out of Time</i> was a lush pop and folk album, boasting a wider array of sounds than the group's previous efforts; its lead single, ~Losing My Religion,~ became the group's biggest single, reaching number four in the U.S. Since the band was exhausted from the <i>Green</i> tour, they chose to stay off the road. Nevertheless, <i>Out of Time</i> became their biggest album, selling over four million copies in the U.S. and spending two weeks at the top of the charts. R.E.M. released the dark, meditative <i>Automatic for the People</i> in the fall of 1992. Though the group had promised a rock album after the softer textures of <i>Out of Time</i>, <i>Automatic for the People</i> was slow, quiet, and reflective, with many songs being graced by string arrangements by Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. Like its predecessor, <i>Automatic for the People</i> was a quadruple platinum success, generating the Top 40 hit singles ~Drive,~ ~Man on the Moon,~ and ~Everybody Hurts.~</p><p>After piecing together two albums in the studio, R.E.M. decided to return to being a rock band with 1994's <i>Monster</i>. Though the record was conceived as a back-to-basics album, the recording of <i>Monster</i> was difficult and plagued with tension. Nevertheless, the album was a huge hit upon its fall release, entering the U.S. and U.K. charts at number one; furthermore, the album won praise from a number of old-school critics who had been reluctant to praise the band, since they didn't ~rock~ in conventional terms. Experiencing some of the strongest sales and reviews of their career, R.E.M. began their first tour since <i>Green</i> early in 1995. Two months into the tour, Bill Berry suffered a brain aneurysm while performing; he had surgery immediately and had fully recovered within a month. R.E.M. resumed their tour two months after Berry's aneurysm, but his illness was only the beginning of a series of problems that plagued the <i>Monster</i> tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal tumor in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to remove a hernia. Despite all the problems, the tour was an enormous financial success, and the group recorded the bulk of a new album. Before the record was released in the fall of 1996, R.E.M. parted ways with their long-time manager Jefferson Holt, allegedly due to sexual harassment charges levied against Holt; the group's lawyer, Bertis Downs, assumed managerial duties.</p><p><i>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</i> was released in September 1996, just before it was announced that the band had re-signed with Warner Bros., reportedly for a record-breaking sum of 80 million dollars. In light of such a huge figure, the commercial failure of <i>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</i> was ironic. Though it received strong reviews and debuted at number two in the U.S. and number one in the U.K., the album failed to generate a hit single, and it only went platinum where its three predecessors went quadruple platinum. By early 1997, the album had already begun its descent down the charts. However, the members of R.E.M. were already pursuing new projects, as Stipe worked with his film company, Single Cell Pictures, and Buck co-wrote songs with Mark Eitzel and worked with a free jazz group, Tuatara. </p><p>In October of 1997, R.E.M. shocked fans and the media with the announcement that Berry was amicably exiting the group to retire to life on his farm; the remaining members continued on as a three-piece, soon convening in Hawaii to begin preliminary work on their next LP. Replacing Berry with a drum machine, the sessions resulted in 1998's <i>Up</i>, widely touted as R.E.M.'s most experimental recording in years. </p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong> ",

				"review": "<p><i>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</i> functioned as the starting point for <i>Up</i>, R.E.M.'s first album without drummer Bill Berry and their first that truly repudiates the legacy of jangle pop. Up is dominated by keyboards, muted percussion, buried guitars, and moody melodies -- only ~Daysleeper~ finds the group in familiar sonic territory. What's striking about the album is that it doesn't sound like a dramatic departure; even without the ringing guitars, it sounds like R.E.M., albeit R.E.M. trying to be adventurous and hip. To a certain extent, that's a good thing, since it proves that the band has developed a signature sound more elastic than many would have predicted, and that they are skilled enough to successfully take risks with their sound. Above all else, <i>Up</i> is an accomplished and varied record, the work of smart record-makers. It is also the work of veteran musicians -- for the first time, R.E.M. sound like they're playing catch-up, trying to keep their hip status intact. Occasionally, they pull it all together, as on the ominous opener ~Airportman~ and the darkly seductive ~Suspicion,~ but they stretch their capacities to the breaking point nearly as often, as on the Pet Sounds pastiche ~At My Most Beautiful,~ which comes off as second-rate High Llamas. Most of <i>Up</i>, however, falls in between those two extremes, winding up as self-consciously moody, down-tempo songs that fail to make an impression because they either don't take enough chances or they fail to speak directly -- they are simply well-crafted tracks that are easy to admire, but hard to love. Ultimately, that is what distinguishes this new incarnation of R.E.M.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<p>R.E.M. began their Warner contract in 1988 as the biggest band to emerge from the college-radio-fueled American underground. Fifteen years later, they released <i>In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003</i>, the first overview of their long stint at Warner Records. During that decade and a half, R.E.M. had a turbulent journey. At the outset, their legend and influence as one of the key -- if not the key -- bands of the American underground was firmly in place, but their success kept growing, culminating in a breakthrough to international stardom in 1991 thanks to ~Losing My Religion~ and <i>Out of Time</i>. For a few years there, they were one of the biggest bands in the world, standing as role models and godfathers for the alt-rock explosion of the '90s; even as grunge ruled the U.S. and U.K., R.E.M. were having their biggest hits with the brooding <i>Automatic for the People</i> (1992) and the guitar-heavy return-to-rock <i>Monster</i> (1994). Then, midway through the decade, the road got a little bumpy. The <i>Monster</i> tour was plagued with problems, the most noteworthy being drummer Bill Berry's on-stage aneurysm in 1995. He left the band the next year, not long after the band parted ways with Jefferson Holt, their longtime manager who was immortalized in their 1984 song ~Little America.~ Singer Michael Stipe, guitarist Peter Buck, and Mike Mills struggled to find their footing as a trio as they tackled more ambitious projects that found an ever more selective audience. Truth be told, this transition started on the final Berry album, 1996's <i>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</i>, which found R.E.M. expanding their sonic template to acclaim from critics and hardcore fans, even if they started to see the audience they won over the previous decade start to shrink.</p> <p>All this means the Warner era for R.E.M. doesn't represent one particular phase of their career -- during their time at Warner, they went through two phases, with the first half being the culmination of their rise and the second being their awkward return to cult status. This divide is clear and fairly easy to pinpoint. In his track-by-track liner notes (neatly mirroring his notes for the 1987 rarities comp <i>Dead Letter Office</i>), Buck claims that dividing line is pre- and post-~Losing My Religion,~ which is true at least as far as stardom goes, but it could be argued that the classic period ended with Automatic, since that follow-up to Out of Time showed that R.E.M. could not only live with the fame, but flourish within it. Everything that followed Automatic came from a different narrative and derived from a different starting point, one that was removed from the jangle pop that lay at the heart of their first ten years as recording artists. Related, yes, but quite different -- more self-conscious, heavily produced, and deliberate, occasionally reaping great results but just as often sounding labored. It was a great contrast to early R.E.M., where the music seemed to flow naturally and easily. Though it has no early IRS material, In Time paints this contrast effectively, not only through the Green and Automatic material, but even through more recent material -- the new song ~Bad Day~ and the 2001 revamp of ~All the Right Friends~ (contrary to Buck's claim in the liners that the band did cut this for IRS; it even appeared as a bonus track to a European reissue of <i>Dead Letter Office</i>). Both are built on a swirling, jangling folk-rock guitar line, propulsive rhythms, intertwined vocal harmonies, and urgent vocals from Stipe. In other words, they sound like classic R.E.M., and they should -- they date from the '80s and bear co-writing credits with Berry. Unfortunately, they sound much fresher than the other new song, the overly fussy ~Animal,~ which is the problem with In Time in a nutshell: the two phases of R.E.M.'s career don't sit well together, but here, they're given close to equal space. R.E.M. the quartet does get more time than R.E.M. the trio, and the latter did produce some really nice tracks, which are chronicled here: ~The Great Beyond~ is a minor masterpiece, ~All the Way to Reno~ is the best of their faux-lounge phase, and ~Imitation of Life~ and ~Daysleeper~ are good classicist R.E.M. Still, the immaculate production of Pat McCarthy's work with Buck, Mills, and Stipe has a denser, heavier, more laborious feel than Scott Litt's work with Berry, Buck, Mills, and Stipe, and the two not only don't fit together, the oddity of the pairing points out that there are a number of missing singles -- a full 17, if international releases and radio-only hits are counted (and, given the nature of '90s rock, they do count). And these aren't minor songs, either; they're modern rock radio staples: ~Pop Song 89,~ ~Texarkana,~ ~Drive,~ ~Ignoreland,~ ~Bang and Blame,~ ~Strange Currencies,~ ~Crush With Eyeliner,~ ~Bittersweet Me,~ and ~Shiny Happy People,~ the latter of which is roundly hated by the band yet nevertheless should be on a hits compilation for the sake of completeness. Of course, not all the songs could fit on a mere 18-track compilation -- and if they went for a double-disc set, they'd be better off with a career-spanning set -- but the song selection leaves something to be desired, even if it does present a reasonably accurate portrait of R.E.M. the adult alternative pop band, and it certainly does point out the inconsistencies of the band's Warner work. So, in that sense, In Time is an effective collection, but it also remains a little disappointing since it not only could have been done better, but by its very nature, this compilation can't help but point out the creative cul-de-sac R.E.M. found themselves in at the end of their Warner career. It's not the fate that anyone would have predicted in 1988.</p><p>[In Time was also released as a double-disc limited edition, encased in a see-through plastic slipcase and containing a poster of the trio, plus an extended booklet containing Buck's track-by-track notes for the 15-track collection of B-sides, compilation tracks, rarities, and oddities. Longtime fans should not see this as <i>Dead Letter Office</i>, Vol. 2. For one thing, by <i>Monster</i>, R.E.M. had run out of interesting non-LP rarities and started releasing an endless series of live versions as B-sides. Before that, a lot of the B-sides were instrumentals, not full-fledged songs. Those full-fledged songs were saved for various-artists compilation albums, and of those, there are two brilliant songs -- ~Fretless~ and ~It's a Free World Baby,~ two <i>Out of Time</i> outtakes that Buck admits should have been on the album. Apart from that, there's only one more real non-LP song of note here, and that's the New Adventures outtake ~Revolution,~ which is of equal quality to the album. After these three songs, there are some good B-sides that nevertheless aren't much more than B-sides: the acoustic version of ~Pop Song 89,~ the rushed spoken word lark ~Chance (Dub),~ William S. Burroughs singing ~Star Me Kitten,~ a good alternate version of ~Leave,~ and worthy live versions of ~Turn You Inside-out~ and ~Country Feedback.~ Of course, it's hard not to notice that there are roughly 25 B-sides and compilation tracks that could have made the cut, and while none of them are consequential, longtime fans may wonder why such enjoyable instrumental throwaways like ~Memphis Train Blues~ were left behind, or why there's a seeming aversion to any of the good cover versions the band did during the '90s (including Syd Barrett's ~Dark Globe,~ Suzanne Vega's ~Tom's Diner,~ Iggy Pop's ~Funtime,~ and Richard Thompson's ~Wall of Death~). Cuts like these may be missed, but this bonus disc is still a worthy way to get most of the non-LP highlights R.E.M. released during the Warner years, particularly because ~Fretless~ and ~It's a Free World Baby~ are so good. Finally, initial pressings of In Time carried a misprint on their spines that billed the collection as the best of 1998-2003, which could be seen as a revealing Freudian slip, in a way.]</p> &mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

The anthemic guitar heroics present on Pablo Honey and even <i>The Bends</i> are nowhere to be heard here. Radiohead have stripped away many of the obvious elements of guitar rock, creating music that is subtle and textured yet still has the feeling of rock & roll. Even at its most adventurous -- such as the complex, multi-segmented ~Paranoid Android~ -- the band is tight, melodic, and muscular, and Thom Yorke's voice effortlessly shifts from a sweet falsetto to vicious snarls. It's a thoroughly astonishing demonstration of musical virtuosity and becomes even more impressive with repeated listens, which reveal subtleties like electronica rhythms, eerie keyboards, odd time signatures, and complex syncopations. Yet all of this would simply be showmanship if the songs weren't strong in themselves, and OK Computer is filled with moody masterpieces, from the shimmering ~Subterranean Homesick Alien~ and the sighing ~Karma Police~ to the gothic crawl of ~Exit Music (For a Film).~ <i>OK Computer</i> is the album that establishes Radiohead as one of the most inventive and rewarding guitar rock bands of the '90s.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

If anything, she's strengthened her formula here, making the divisions between the genres nearly indistinguishable. Take the title track, for instance. It opens with a bluesy acoustic guitar before kicking into a New Orleans brass band about halfway through -- and the great thing about it is that Raitt makes the switch sound natural, even inevitable, never forced. And that's just the tip of the iceberg here, since Give It Up is filled with great songs, delivered in familiar, yet always surprising, ways by Raitt and her skilled band. For those that want to pigeonhole her as a white blues singer, she delivers the lovely ~Nothing Seems to Matter,~ a gentle mid-tempo number that's as mellow as Linda Ronstadt and far more seductive. That's the key to Give It Up: Yes, Raitt can be earthy and sexy, but she balances it with an inviting sensuality that makes the record glow. It's all delivered in a fantastic set of originals and covers performed so naturally it's hard to tell them apart and roots music so thoroughly fused that it all sounds original, even when it's possible to spot the individual elements or influences. Raitt would go on to greater chart successes, but she not only had trouble topping this record, generations of singers, from Sheryl Crow to Shelby Lynne, have used this as a touchstone. One of the great Southern California records.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"biography": "<p>Willis Alan Ramsey, a singer-songwriter with deep Texas roots, released his first and only album, called Willis Alan Ramsey, in 1972 on Leon Russell''s Shelter Records label. The recording was a critical success that included ~Boy From Oklahoma~, a tribute to Woody Guthrie. Jimmy Buffett and Jerry Jeff Waker, among others, covered Ramsey''s songs, but the song that became best known was a knockoff Ramsey called ~Muskrat Candlelight~. Released by the pop group America, it was later recorded and retitled ~Muskrat Love~ by The Captain and Tennille and reached the Billboard Top 10, becoming one of the most popular songs of our time. Ramsey eventually left both Shelter Records and the United States, moving to Great Britain in the 1980''s to explore Celtic songwriting and instrumental traditions.</p><p>When he returned to the United States, he was reintroduced to Lyle Lovett, who had run the University of Texas coffeehouse where Ramsey played in the early 1970''s. He and Lovett wrote the song, ~North Dakota~, heard on Lovett''s 1992 album, Joshua Judges Ruth. A few years later, Shawn Colvin recorded ~Satin Sheets~ which helped stimulate interest in a new Ramsey recording. Lovett, who called Willis Alan Ramsey ~one of the greatest records of all time~, has since covered a newer Ramsey song, ~Sleepwalking~. With a new album still in the works, Ramsey has begun touring for the first time in seven years, performing this year at the Smithsonian''s Woody Guthrie Tribute in Washington DC, the Kerville Folk Festival, the annual Folk Alliance Convention in Cleveland, The Bluebird Cafe in Nashville and several shows around the Southwest.</p><p>His self titled debut recording has been re-released by Koch Records and is creating a whole new generation of fans around the world.</p>",

		"biography": "<p>Every few years it seems as if the jazz media goes out of its way to hype one young artist, over-praising him to such an extent that it is easy to tear him down when the next season arrives. In the early '90s, Joshua Redman briefly became a media darling, but in his case he largely deserved the attention. A talented bop-based tenorman, Redman (who will probably never be an innovator) is a throwback to the styles of Red Holloway and Gene Ammons, but also has an inquisitive spirit and can play intriguing music when inspired.</p><p>The son of the great tenor saxophonist Dewey Redman, Joshua graduated from Harvard and (after debating about whether to become a doctor) he seemed headed toward studying law at Yale. However, Redman came in first place at the 1991 Thelonious Monk competition, landed a recording contract with Warner Bros., and was soon on the cover of most jazz magazines. Pat Metheny was a guest on one of his albums (the Redman-Metheny interplay during their engagements was quite memorable) and, although Redman has had success constantly touring with his own group, it is a pity that his apprentice period as a sideman was so brief. In 1996, Joshua Redman recorded and briefly toured with Chick Corea's ~Tribute to Bud Powell~ sextet; the solo Timeless Tales (For Changing Times) followed in 1998, and in 2000 he returned with Beyond. Passage of Time appeared in early 2001, and was followed by a lengthy tour of the US. The next year, Elastic appeared in stores with an uncharacteristically humorous sight gag adorning the cover. That also reflected on the music, which was more adventurous and playful than in the past, owing a debt to his electronica and experimental rock influences. In 2005, Redman made the move to Nonesuch and released Momentum.</p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b>",

This European CD, probably a bootleg, shows just how exciting the band was live. On 70 minutes of music recorded in a San Francisco club, Redman often indulges in close interplay and exciting tradeoffs with Metheny; the two clearly inspired each other. The recording quality is decent, and the performances overall actually exceed Wish in passion and creativity. Highlights include ~Blues for Pat,~ an 18½-minute version of ~St. Thomas~ and ~Carla's Groove.~ All Joshua Redman and Pat Metheny fans will want this one.</p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b>"

Those descriptions can certainly be applied to Redman's music, which, while pulling at the boundaries of modern hard bop, is also fairly easy to grab on to. Joined by his regular bandmembers of the period (pianist Brad Mehldau, bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade), Redman performs a full set of originals which, although not derivative, do fit into the straight-ahead tradition. At this point in time, Redman was growing from album to album, having already started at a high level. A fine outing.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b></p>"

Redman has long evinced the influences of such similarly inclined legends as Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, and John Coltrane, and Back East is no exception — which isn't to say it's business as usual. Admittedly, while this is a straight-ahead acoustic jazz date, it is one ripe with creative energy that finds Redman's knack for deeply thoughtful improvisation and unexpected rhythmic interplay in full flower. Recorded prior to the passing of Redman's father, saxophonist Dewey Redman, in 2006, the album is dedicated in his father's memory and not only features the elder Redman alongside his son, but Redman even gives him a solo turn on the last cut. Interestingly, Back East finds Redman ruminating on alternate meanings of the title: as in the ~Back East~ of cities like New York and Boston or as in Eastern philosophies and religious beliefs. This leads Redman to myriad musical settings, including the funky swing of ~The Surrey with the Fringe on Top~ and the more raga-influenced and expansive post-bop of the original ~Zarafah.~ Joining Redman here is a cadre of top-notch rhythm players, including bassists Larry Grenadier, Reuben Rogers, and Christian McBride; drummers Ali Jackson, Brian Blade, and Eric Harland; and saxophonists Chris Cheek and Joe Lovano.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Matt Collar</b></p>"

				"review": "<p>River was a looser and rootsier affair than Terry Reid's first records, taken from a sprawl of sessions in London and California that generated enough material for several albums. The very looseness that gives the effort some charm is the same quality, however, that keeps it from being a major work. The songs mostly sound unfinished, as if they're friendly jams in which Reid and the musicians (including, most notably, David Lindley on half the album and percussionist Willie Bobo on the title track) are working out some song ideas or twisting around some riffs. It often brings to mind those parts of songs where the likes of Van Morrison, Tim Buckley, or Robert Plant sing-scat improvised-sounding vocal passages. The difference is that, for the most part, those singers used such sections to embellish solid songs. On River, the quasi-stream-of-consciousness vocal ramblings are the songs. The first four of the seven songs are very much in a funky, laid-back blues-rock groove, prominently featuring Lindley on steel, slide, and electric guitars. Reid, and the album itself, really begin to find more of an individual voice on ~River,~ where beguiling Latin-Brazilian elements are introduced in the guitar, melody, and rhythm. The final two cuts, ~Dream~ and ~Milestones,~ back Reid's vocals only with acoustic guitar, and have a romantic melancholy that likewise makes them highlights of this highly personal but uneven record.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p><hr/><p>Much is made of the failures of Terry Reid's career. The man who turned down the vocalist slot in Led Zeppelin (and recommended Robert Plant to Jimmy Page); the man who as a teenage prodigy had his early albums irreparably mangled by manager/producer Mickie Most; in short a man who many name-drop as the artist who fate dealt a bad hand. Yet, few people actually mention his triumphs. For, following a seemingly endless search for a sound and working methodology to suit his incredible voice, Reid did strike creative gold by the early 70s and River was to be his masterpiece.</p><p>High profile tours in the US throughout the late 60s supporting the likes of Cream and the Rolling Stones (Terry was at Altamont on that fateful night) honed his craft into something almost totally new at the time. On his journey he'd befriended legendary multi-instrumentalist David Lindley of psychedelic world music pioneers, Kaleidoscope (coincidentally one of Jimmy Page's favourite bands), whose slide work graces River. An incendiary live turn was captured on film during the 1971 Glastonbury festival and it showed how Terry's funky folk blues was evolving into a similar abstraction that Van Morrison had stumbled over with Astral Weeks.</p><p>It's this jazzy abstraction that makes River such a treasure. With Lindley in tow, Reid made his first attempt to capture his muse in London with Yes's engineer Eddie Offord, but too much 'looseness' made the results somewhat frustrating. Only the freeform acoustic tracks, ''Dream'' and ''Milestones'', survive from these sessions and, while the meandering scat style is hard to grasp at first, the whole ambience is insidious, just as the theme of the river and its journey pervades the whole album.</p><p>Moving to America and working with Atlantic Recordsüber-producer Tom Dowd, the album became a yin-yang experience, with its first side a bluesy electric trip through just three prolonged jams, and the second featuring the two aforementioned tracks plus two other acoustic beauties (''Live Life'' and the sublime ''River'').</p><p>Lindley's guitar work is as fluid as Reid's way with words. Phrases and lines become mere sounds in Terry's mouth. To call these tone poems 'rambling' is to misunderstand the deeply charged emotion and pioneering spirit that marked the turbulent recording process. The river theme is perfectly mirrored by song structures that flow, ebb and never, for one instant, remain static. Of course, the Reid jinx wasn't lifted by this wonderful album. One more classic (Seed Of Memory) was to follow in 1976 and then it seemed as if Terry and the world reconciled themselves to never being as huge as he undoubtedly deserved to be. His influence on subsequent artists was, however, significant. Just try listening to Robert Palmer's Sneaking Sally Through The Alley after this album! Reissued at last, now the world can finally catch up.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Chris Jones</strong></p>"

A founder of the seminal group Pentangle, Renbourn's music fuses British and Celtic folk with blues, jazz, British early music, classic guitar and Eastern styles.</p><p>Born and raised in Torquay, England, Renbourn began playing guitar as a teen. At first he was into skiffle, a style that became popular as the a folk music revival was beginning. An instructional book, How to Play Guitar by Rory McKuen, introduced Renbourn to the music of many American folk artists and he began to research them. In 1964, he began studying classical guitar at the George Abbot School in Guildford. Two years later he was playing folk music in Soho where he met many other musicians, including Paul Simon, Davey Graham and most importantly, Bert Jansch, a guitar player whom Renbourn greatly admired. Renbourn and Jansch were roommates for a while; during impromptu sessions they noticed how much in synch they were and how easy it was to play together. Both men had fledgling recording careers at the time. Renbourn performed on Jansch's second album and afterward they teamed up formally to record <i>Bert and John</i>.</p><p>In 1967 the two founded Pentangle and remained together through 1978. Renbourn, as with the other group members, continued to release such solo albums as <i>The Hermit</i> and <i>The Black Balloon</i>. He formed the John Renbourn Group in the '80s and began adding an East Indian percussion and jazz woodwinds to his music. Around the mid-'80s, he teamed up with guitarist Stefan Grossman and embarked upon a series of world tours. The two also recorded a few albums before Renbourn went on to found the ensemble Ship of Fools and play music with a stronger Celtic influence. He continues to tour alone and with other guitarists including Grossman, Larry Coryell and Isaac Guillory. He also occasionally reunites with Jansch and sometimes tours with Scottish storyteller Robin Williamson.</p>&mdash; <b>Sandra Brennan</b>",

		"biography": "<p>By the time the Rolling Stones began calling themselves the World's Greatest Rock & Roll Band in the late '60s, they had already staked out an impressive claim on the title. As the self-consciously dangerous alternative to the bouncy Merseybeat of the Beatles in the British Invasion, the Stones had pioneered the gritty, hard-driving blues-based rock & roll that came to define hard rock. With his preening machismo and latent maliciousness, Mick Jagger became the prototypical rock frontman, tempering his macho showmanship with a detached, campy irony while Keith Richards and Brian Jones wrote the blueprint for sinewy, interlocking rhythm guitars. Backed by the strong yet subtly swinging rhythm section of bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts, the Stones became the breakout band of the British blues scene, eclipsing such contemporaries as the Animals and Them. Over the course of their career, the Stones never really abandoned blues, but as soon as they reached popularity in the U.K., they began experimenting musically, incorporating the British pop of contemporaries like the Beatles, Kinks, and Who into their sound. After a brief dalliance with psychedelia, the Stones re-emerged in the late '60s as a jaded, blues-soaked hard rock quintet. The Stones always flirted with the seedy side of rock & roll, but as the hippie dream began to break apart, they exposed and reveled in the new rock culture. It wasn't without difficulty, of course. Shortly after he was fired from the group, Jones was found dead in a swimming pool, while at a 1969 free concert at Altamont, a concertgoer was brutally killed during the Stones' show. But the Stones never stopped going. For the next 30 years, they continued to record and perform, and while their records weren't always blockbusters, they were never less than the most visible band of their era -- certainly, none of their British peers continued to be as popular or productive as the Stones. And no band since has proven to have such a broad fan base or far-reaching popularity, and it is impossible to hear any of the groups that followed them without detecting some sort of influence, whether it was musical or aesthetic.</p><p>Throughout their career, Mick Jagger (vocals) and Keith Richards (guitar, vocals) remained at the core of the Rolling Stones. The pair initially met as children at Dartford Maypole County Primary School. They drifted apart over the next ten years, eventually making each other's acquaintance again in 1960, when they met through a mutual friend, Dick Taylor, who was attending Sidcup Art School with Richards. At the time, Jagger was studying at the London School of Economics and playing with Taylor in the blues band Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys. Shortly afterward, Richards joined the band. Within a year, they had met Brian Jones (guitar, vocals), a Cheltenham native who had dropped out of school to play saxophone and clarinet. By the time he became a fixture on the British blues scene, Jones had already had a wild life. He ran away to Scandinavia when he was 16; by that time, he had already fathered two illegitimate children. He returned to Cheltenham after a few months, where he began playing with the Ramrods. Shortly afterward, he moved to London, where he played in Alexis Korner's group, Blues Inc. Jones quickly decided he wanted to form his own group and advertised for members; among those he recruited was the heavyset blues pianist Ian Stewart.</p><p>As he played with his group, Jones also moonlighted under the name Elmo Jones at the Ealing Blues Club. At the pub, he became reacquainted with Blues, Inc., which now featured drummer Charlie Watts, and, on occasion, cameos by Jagger and Richards. Jones became friends with Jagger and Richards, and they soon began playing together with Taylor and Stewart; during this time, Mick was elevated to the status of Blues, Inc.'s lead singer. With the assistance of drummer Tony Chapman, the fledgling band recorded a demo tape. After the tape was rejected by EMI, Taylor left the band to attend the Royal College of Art; he would later form the Pretty Things. Before Taylor's departure, the group named itself the Rolling Stones, borrowing the moniker from a Muddy Waters song.</p><p>The Rolling Stones gave their first performance at the Marquee Club in London on July 12, 1962. At the time, the group consisted of Jagger, Richards, Jones, pianist Ian Stewart, drummer Mick Avory, and Dick Taylor, who had briefly returned to the fold. Weeks after the concert, Taylor left again and was replaced by Bill Wyman, formerly of the Cliftons. Avory also left the group -- he would later join the Kinks -- and the Stones hired Tony Chapman, who proved to be unsatisfactory. After a few months of persuasion, the band recruited Charlie Watts, who had quit Blues, Inc. to work at an advertising agency once the group's schedule became too hectic. By 1963, the band's lineup had been set, and the Stones began an eight-month residency at the Crawdaddy Club, which proved to substantially increase their fan base. It also attracted the attention of Andrew Loog Oldham, who became the Stones' manager, signing them from underneath Crawdaddy's Giorgio Gomelsky. Although Oldham didn't know much about music, he was gifted at promotion, and he latched upon the idea of fashioning the Stones as the bad-boy opposition to the clean-cut Beatles. At his insistence, the large yet meek Stewart was forced out of the group, since his appearance contrasted with the rest of the group. Stewart didn't disappear from the Stones; he became one of their key roadies and played on their albums and tours until his death in 1985.</p><p>With Oldham's help, the Rolling Stones signed with Decca Records, and that June, they released their debut single, a cover of Chuck Berry's ~Come On.~ The single became a minor hit, reaching number 21, and the group supported it with appearances on festivals and package tours. At the end of the year, they released a version of Lennon-McCartney's ~I Wanna Be Your Man~ that soared into the Top 15. Early in 1964, they released a cover of Buddy Holly's ~Not Fade Away,~ which shot to number three. ~Not Fade Away~ became their first American hit, reaching number 48 that spring. By that time, the Stones were notorious in their homeland. Considerably rougher and sexier than the Beatles, the Stones were the subject of numerous sensationalistic articles in the British press, culminating in a story about the band urinating in public. All of these stories cemented the Stones as a dangerous, rebellious band in the minds of the public, and had the effect of beginning a manufactured rivalry between them and the Beatles, which helped the group rocket to popularity in the U.S. In the spring of 1964, the Stones released their eponymous debut album, which was followed by ~It's All Over Now,~ their first U.K. number one. That summer, they toured America to riotous crowds, recording the Five by Five EP at Chess Records in Chicago in the midst of the tour. By the time it was over, they had another number one U.K. single with Howlin' Wolf's ~Little Red Rooster.~ Although the Stones had achieved massive popularity, Oldham decided to push Jagger and Richards into composing their own songs, since they -- and his publishing company -- would receive more money that away. In June of 1964, the group released their first original single, ~Tell Me (You're Coming Back),~ which became their first American Top 40 hit. Shortly afterward, a version of Irma Thomas' ~Time Is on My Side~ became their first U.S. Top Ten. It was followed by ~The Last Time~ in early 1965, a number one U.K. and Top Ten U.S. hit that began a virtually uninterrupted string of Jagger-Richards hit singles. Still, it wasn't until the group released ~(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction~ in the summer of 1965 that they were elevated to superstars. Driven by a fuzz-guitar riff designed to replicate the sound of a horn section, ~Satisfaction~ signaled that Jagger and Richards had come into their own as songwriters, breaking away from their blues roots and developing a signature style of big, bluesy riffs and wry, sardonic lyrics. It stayed at number one for four weeks and began a string of Top Ten singles that ran for the next two years, including such classics as ~Get off My Cloud,~ ~19th Nervous Breakdown,~ ~As Tears Go By,~ and ~Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?~</p><p>By 1966, the Stones had decided to respond to the Beatles' increasingly complex albums with their first album of all-original material, <i>Aftermath</i>. Due to Brian Jones' increasingly exotic musical tastes, the record boasted a wide range of influences, from the sitar-drenched ~Paint It, Black~ to the Eastern drones of ~I'm Going Home.~ These eclectic influences continued to blossom on <i>Between the Buttons</i> (1967), the most pop-oriented album the group ever made. Ironically, the album's release was bookended by two of the most notorious incidents in the band's history. Before the record was released, the Stones performed the suggestive ~Let's Spend the Night Together,~ the B-side to the medieval ballad ~Ruby Tuesday,~ on The Ed Sullivan Show, which forced Jagger to alter the song's title to an incomprehensible mumble, or else face being banned. In February of 1967, Jagger and Richards were arrested for drug possession, and within three months, Jones was arrested on the same charge. All three were given suspended jail sentences, and the group backed away from the spotlight as the summer of love kicked into gear in 1967. Jagger, along with his then-girlfriend Marianne Faithfull, went with the Beatles to meet the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi; they were also prominent in the international broadcast of the Beatles' ~All You Need Is Love.~ Appropriately, the Stones' next single, ~Dandelion~/~We Love You,~ was a psychedelic pop effort, and it was followed by their response to Sgt. Pepper, <i>Their Satanic Majesties Request</i>, which was greeted with lukewarm reviews.</p><p>The Stones' infatuation with psychedelia was brief. By early 1968, they had fired Andrew Loog Oldham and hired Allen Klein as their manager. The move coincided with their return to driving rock & roll, which happened to coincide with Richards' discovery of open tunings, a move that gave the Stones their distinctively fat, powerful sound. The revitalized Stones were showcased on the malevolent single ~Jumpin' Jack Flash,~ which climbed to number three in May 1968. Their next album, Beggar's Banquet, was finally released in the fall, after being delayed for five months due its controversial cover art of a dirty, graffiti-laden restroom. An edgy record filled with detours into straight blues and campy country, Beggar's Banquet was hailed as a masterpiece among the fledgling rock press. Although it was seen as a return to form, few realized that while it opened a new chapter of the Stones' history, it also was the closing of their time with Brian Jones. Throughout the recording of <i>Beggar's Banquet</i>, Jones was on the sidelines due to his deepening drug addiction and his resentment of the dominance of Jagger and Richards. Jones left the band on June 9, 1969, claiming to be suffering from artistic differences between himself and the rest of the band. On July 3, 1969 -- less than a month after his departure -- Jones was found dead in his swimming pool. The coroner ruled that it was ~death by misadventure,~ yet his passing was the subject of countless rumors over the next two years.</p><p>By the time of his death, the Stones had already replaced Brian Jones with Mick Taylor, a former guitarist for John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. He wasn't featured on ~Honky Tonk Women,~ a number one single released days after Jones' funeral, and he contributed only a handful of leads on their next album, <i>Let It Bleed</i>. Released in the fall of 1969, <i>Let It Bleed</i> was comprised of sessions with Jones and Taylor, yet it continued the direction of Beggar's Banquet, signaling that a new era in the Stones' career had begun, one marked by ragged music and an increasingly wasted sensibility. Following Jagger's filming of Ned Kelly in Australia during the first part of 1969, the group launched its first American tour in three years. Throughout the tour -- the first where they were billed as the World's Greatest Rock & Roll Band -- the group broke attendance records, but it was given a sour note when the group staged a free concert at Altamont Speedway. On the advice of the Grateful Dead, the Stones hired Hell's Angels as security, but that plan backfired tragically. The entire show was unorganized and in shambles, yet it turned tragic when the Angels killed a young black man, Meredith Hunter, during the Stones' performance. In the wake of the public outcry, the Stones again retreated from the spotlight and dropped ~Sympathy for the Devil,~ which some critics ignorantly claimed incited the violence, from their set.</p><p>As the group entered hiatus, they released the live <i>Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!</i> in the fall of 1970. It was their last album for Decca/London, and they formed Rolling Stones Records, which became a subsidiary of Atlantic Records. During 1970, Jagger starred in Nicolas Roeg's cult film Performance and married Nicaraguan model Bianca Perez Morena de Macias, and the couple quickly entered high society. As Jagger was jet-setting, Richards was slumming, hanging out with country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons. Keith wound up having more musical influence on 1971's <i>Sticky Fingers</i>, the first album the Stones released though their new label. Following its release, the band retreated to France on tax exile, where they shared a house and recorded a double album, <i>Exile on Main St.</i> Upon its May 1972 release, <i>Exile on Main St.</i> was widely panned, but over time it came to be considered one of the group's defining moments.</p><p>Following Exile, the Stones began to splinter in two, as Jagger concentrated on being a celebrity and Richards sank into drug addiction. The band remained popular throughout the '70s, but their critical support waned. <i>Goats Head Soup</i>, released in 1973, reached number one, as did 1974's <i>It's Only Rock 'n' Roll</i>, but neither record was particularly well received. Taylor left the band after <i>It's Only Rock 'n' Roll</i>, and the group recorded their next album as they auditioned new lead guitarists, including Jeff Beck. They finally settled on Ron Wood, former lead guitarist for the Faces and Rod Stewart, in 1976, the same year they released Black n' Blue, which only featured Wood on a handful of cuts. During the mid- and late '70s, all the Stones pursued side projects, with both Wyman and Wood releasing solo albums with regularity. Richards was arrested in Canada in 1977 with his common-law wife Anita Pallenberg for heroin possession. After his arrest, he cleaned up and was given a suspended sentence the following year. The band reconvened in 1978 to record <i>Some Girls</i>, an energetic response to punk, new wave, and disco. The record and its first single, the thumping disco-rocker ~Miss You,~ both reached number one, and the album restored the group's image. However, the group squandered that goodwill with the follow-up, Emotional Rescue, a number one record that nevertheless received lukewarm reviews upon its 1980 release. <i>Tattoo You</i>, released the following year, fared better both critically and commercially, as the singles ~Start Me Up~ and ~Waiting on a Friend~ helped the album spend nine weeks at number one. The Stones supported <i>Tattoo You</i> with an extensive stadium tour captured in Hal Ashby's movie Let's Spend the Night Together and the 1982 live album <i>Still Life</i>.</p><p><i>Tattoo You</i> proved to be the last time the Stones completely dominated the charts and the stadiums. Although the group continued to sell out concerts in the '80s and '90s, their records didn't sell as well as previous efforts, partially because the albums suffered due to Jagger and Richards' notorious mid-'80s feud. Starting with 1983's <i>Undercover</i>, the duo conflicted about which way the band should go, with Jagger wanting the Stones to follow contemporary trends and Richards wanting them to stay true to their rock roots. As a result, <i>Undercover</i> was a mean-spirited, unfocused record that received relatively weak sales and mixed reviews. Released in 1986, <i>Dirty Work</i> suffered a worse fate, since Jagger was preoccupied with his fledgling solo career. Once Jagger decided that the Stones would not support <i>Dirty Work</i> with a tour, Richards decided to make his own solo record with 1988's <i>Talk Is Cheap</i>. Appearing a year after Jagger's failed second solo album, <i>Talk Is Cheap</i> received good reviews and went gold, prompting Jagger and Richards to reunite late in 1988. The following year, the Stones released <i>Steel Wheels</i>, which was received with good reviews, but the record was overshadowed by its supporting tour, which grossed over 140 million dollars and broke many box office records. In 1991, the live album <i>Flashpoint</i>, which was culled from the <i>Steel Wheels</i> shows, was released.</p><p>Following the release of <i>Flashpoint</i>, Bill Wyman left the band; he published a memoir, Stone Alone, within a few years of leaving. The Stones didn't immediately replace Wyman, since they were all working on solo projects; this time, there was none of the animosity surrounding their mid-'80s projects. The group reconvened in 1994 with bassist Darryl Jones, who had previously played with Miles Davis and Sting, to record and release the Don Was-produced <i>Voodoo Lounge</i>. The album received the band's strongest reviews in years, and its accompanying tour was even more successful than the <i>Steel Wheels</i> tour. On top of being more successful than its predecessor, <i>Voodoo Lounge</i> also won the Stones their first Grammy for Best Rock Album. Upon the completion of the <i>Voodoo Lounge</i> tour, the Stones released the live, ~unplugged~ album <i>Stripped</i> in the fall of 1995. Similarly, after wrapping up their tour in support of 1997's <i>Bridges to Babylon</i>, the group issued yet another live set, <i>No Security</i>, the following year. A high-profile greatest-hits tour in 2002 was launched despite the lack of a studio album to support, and its album document <i>Live Licks</i> appeared in 2004. A year later, the group issued <i>A Bigger Bang</i>, their third effort with producer Don Was.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>",

Most of the Stones' early albums suffer from three or four very weak cuts; Now! is almost uniformly strong start-to-finish, the emphasis on some of their blackest material. The covers of ~Down Home Girl,~ Bo Diddley's vibrating ~Mona,~ Otis Redding's ~Pain in My Heart,~ and Barbara Lynn's ~Oh Baby~ are all among the group's best R&B interpretations. The best gem is ~Little Red Rooster,~ a pure blues with wonderful slide guitar from Brian Jones (and a number one single in Britain, although it was only an album track in the U.S.). As songwriters, Jagger and Richards are still struggling, but they come up with one of their first winners (and an American Top 20 hit) with the yearning, soulful ~Heart of Stone.~</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>The Stones forsook psychedelic experimentation to return to their blues roots on this celebrated album, which was immediately acclaimed as one of their landmark achievements. A strong acoustic Delta blues flavor colors much of the material, particularly ~Salt of the Earth~ and ~No Expectations,~ which features some beautiful slide guitar work. Basic rock & roll was not forgotten, however: ~Street Fighting Man,~ a reflection of the political turbulence of 1968, was one of their most innovative singles, and ~Sympathy for the Devil,~ with its fire-dancing guitar licks, leering Jagger vocals, African rhythms, and explicitly satanic lyrics, was an image-defining epic. On ~Stray Cat Blues,~ Jagger and crew began to explore the kind of decadent sexual sleaze that they would take to the point of self-parody by the mid-'70s. At the time, though, the approach was still fresh, and the lyrical bite of most of the material ensured <i>Beggars Banquet's</i> place as one of the top blues-based rock records of all time.</p><p>[The Rolling Stones' London/ABKCO catalog was reissued in August of 2002, packaged in digipacks with restored album artwork, remastered, and released as hybrid discs that contain both CD and Super Audio CD layers. The remastering — performed with Direct Stream Digital (DSD) encoding — is a drastic improvement, leaping out of the speaker yet still sounding like the original albums. This is noticeable on the standard CD layer but is considerably more pronounced on the SACD layer, which is shockingly realistic in its detail and presence yet is still faithful to the original mixes; Richards' revved-up acoustic guitar on ~Street Fighting Man~ still sends the machine into overdrive, for instance. It just sounds like he's in the room with you. Even if you've never considered yourself an audiophile, have never heard the differences between standard and gold-plated CDs, you will hear the difference with SACD, even on a cheap stereo system without a high-end amplifier or speakers. And you won't just hear the difference, you'll be an instant convert and wish, hope, and pray that other artists whose catalog hasn't been reissued since the early days of CD — Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, especially the Beatles — are given the same treatment in the very near future. SACD and DSD are that good.]</p>&mdash; <b>Richie Unterberger</b>"

				"review": "<p>Live'r Than You'll Ever Be is a bootleg recording of the Rolling Stones' concert in Oakland, California, from 9 November 1969. It was one of the first live rock music bootlegs and was made notorious as a document of their 1969 tour of the United States. The popularity of the bootleg forced the Stones' label Decca Records to release the live album Get Yer Ya-Yas Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert in 1970. Live'r is also one of the earliest commercial bootleg recordings in rock history, released in December 1969, just two months after the Beatles' Kum Back and five months after Bob Dylan's Great White Wonder. Like the two earlier records, Live'r's outer sleeve is plain white, with its name stamped on in ink.</p><p>Live'r Than You'll Ever Be was recorded by ~Dub~ Taylor from Trademark of Quality using a Sennheiser shotgun microphone and a Uher ~Report 4000~ reel-to-reel tape recorder. It was the first audience-recorded rock bootleg to be mastered and distributed;  some sources consider it the first live bootleg. Though the sound is not nearly as clear as the official release of Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!, the recording is considered to be very strong for an audience recording, especially one of that era. The Rolling Stones performed two sets that night and it is the second concert that was more heavily bootlegged and has sharper sound. Bootleggers had collaborated to record Stones shows across the United States, recording them on two-track Sony recorders for months prior to the release of the album. At least one source claims that the recordings initially came from rock promoter Bill Graham's staff, who used the tapes for broadcast on KSAN and released their edit on Lurch Records in early 1970.</p><p>The recording was made available about one month after the concert, and it became popular enough to spur speculation that the Stones released Ya-Ya's as a response to the bootleg and the quality was high enough that it was rumoured that the band had even released the bootleg themselves. The recording has been released through several bootleg labels, including the original release by Lurch and shortly thereafter Trademark of Quality (catalogue number 71002), Swingin' Pig, and Sister Morphine, usually documenting only the second set. The Swingin' Pig release even replace performances of ~Jumpin' Jack Flash~ and ~Under My Thumb~ with different recordings from the band's 10 November performance in San Diego and their two-night stint in New York City and attempted to enhance the sound quality by using de-clicking technology—both changes have drawn criticism in comparison to the original Lurch Records release.</p><p>Live'r Than You'll Ever Be was favourably reviewed by Greil Marcus in the 7 February 1970 issue of Rolling Stone. He praised its sound and speculated that it may have been recorded from the stage; footage from this concert was recorded by ABKCO Records for the film Gimme Shelter. The album also received praise as a more authentic example of the Stones on stage because Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! was heavily overdubbed in many places. Richie Unterberger has noted that the recording is inferior to the sound quality of Ya-Ya's, but displays a spontaneity that the official recording lacks and this helps to explain its long-lasting appeal to fans. Reviewing the album in 1970, Wim Wenders called it ~the best Rolling Stones record.~</p><p>The album eventually sold enough to qualify for a gold record RIAA certification, with TMOQ sources claiming that it had sold 250,000 copies by November 1970; 150,000 of which were produced by other bootleggers. Although the album did not chart on the Billboard 200, the magazine included it in a list of best-selling bootlegs in 1971, noting that hard sales figures were impossible to confirm, but six-figure numbers had been routinely discussed. The sleeve's generic design was copied by The Who's 1970 album Live at Leeds.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Wikipedia</strong></p>"

The Who's portion has been out before, courtesy of various documentaries, but Taj Mahal playing some loud electric blues is new and great, the live Lennon rendition of ~Yer Blues~ is indispensable, and the Stones' set fills in lots of blanks in their history -- ~Jumpin' Jack Flash~ in one of two live renditions it ever got with Brian Jones in the lineup, ~Sympathy for the Devil~ in an intense run-through, ~Parachute Woman~ as a lost live vehicle for the band, ~You Can't Always Get What You Want~ as a show-stopping rocker even without its extended ending (no Paul Buckmaster choir), and ~No Expectations~ as their first piece of great live blues since ~Little Red Rooster.~</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

Part of the reason why the record was initially greeted with hesitant reviews is that it takes a while to assimilate. A sprawling, weary double album encompassing rock & roll, blues, soul, and country, Exile doesn't try anything new on the surface, but the substance is new. Taking the bleakness that underpinned Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers to an extreme, Exile is a weary record, and not just lyrically. Jagger's vocals are buried in the mix, and the music is a series of dark, dense jams, with Keith Richards and Mick Taylor spinning off incredible riffs and solos. And the songs continue the breakthroughs of their three previous albums. No longer does their country sound forced or kitschy -- it's lived-in and complex, just like the group's forays into soul and gospel. While the songs, including the masterpieces ~Rocks Off,~ ~Tumbling Dice,~ ~Torn and Frayed,~ ~Happy,~ ~Let It Loose,~ and ~Shine a Light,~ are all terrific, they blend together, with only certain lyrics and guitar lines emerging from the murk. It's the kind of record that's gripping on the very first listen, but each subsequent listen reveals something new. Few other albums, let alone double albums, have been so rich and masterful as Exile on Main St., and it stands not only as one of the Stones' best records, but sets a remarkably high standard for all of hard rock.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Legendary as it may be, Exile on Main St. presents a challenge for deluxe remastered reissues. Much of its myth lies in its murk, how its dense, scuzzy sound is the quintessential portrait of rock stars in decadent isolation, the legend bleeding into its creation so thoroughly it is impossible, and unnecessary, to separate one from the other. Without this nearly tactile sound, Exile wouldn’t be Exile, so remastering the record is a tricky business because it should not be too clean. The remaster on the 2010 reissue -- available in a myriad of editions containing variations of a single-disc remaster and a second disc expanded with ten unreleased tracks - doesn’t quite avoid that trap. When “Rocks Off” kicks off the record, what was previously dulled like aged silver is now is too bright: Mick Jagger’s vocals leap and the keyboards ring clearly. Because this is Exile on Main St., a record recorded in a decaying French mansion, it’s impossible to scrape all the grime away from its layers, but the overall impression is that the original master tapes are now presented in high definition: it’s possible to hear what most individual instruments are doing on each track, which may lead for a greater appreciation of the Stones' monumental musicianship, but it’s somewhat at the expense of the album’s mystique.</p><p>Another pitfall in the plans for this deluxe expansion: there aren’t a whole lot of completed unreleased songs. The Stones had a habit of working leftovers from the prior album into a finished product, sometimes taking years to complete a song -- a practice that resulted in great songs but not much left in the vaults. Which isn’t to say there was nothing left behind from Exile’s sessions: the Stones were living where they were recording, so they produced an enormous amount of music, working out the kinks in a song (represented here by alternate takes of “Loving Cup” and a Keith Richards-sung “Soul Survivor”), or wholly reworking an existing song as they did with the loose-limbed “Good Time Women,” which was later revised as “Tumbling Dice.” On occasion, they completed a song that didn’t make the cut, such as “I’m Not Signifying,” a heavily bootlegged shambolic blues that is just about as good as anything on the finished album, but usually they created instrumental beds designed to be completed later with vocals. In this particular case, a handful of these tracks were completed much, much later, with the band finishing up the songs some 38 years later for this deluxe edition. A great deal of attention was paid to making the new additions relatively seamless, with the band going so far as to bring in the long-departed guitarist Mick Taylor for some overdubs. If the end results don’t quite feel as thick as Exile, they nevertheless do feel remarkably like the classic Taylor era. Apart from “Following the River” -- a drowsy piano ballad that tries to rouse itself to blues-gospel -- these are good, sometimes excellent songs, particularly the loose, hip-shaking “Dancing in the Light” and the charging “Plundered My Soul.” At first it's hard not to stare at these hybrid tracks with skepticism, particularly because they’re eating up room that could have been used for other alternate takes, or perhaps the instrumentals themselves, or the occasional bootlegged song that didn’t make the cut, such as “Blood Red Wine,” but once that suspicion fades, you’re left with a handful of very good additions to the Stones songbook -- songs that don’t hold a candle to Exile but are remarkable re-creations of Taylor-era rock & roll, songs that could easily have been slid onto It’s Only Rock 'N Roll, when the group was easing into their grooves, confident that they were the greatest rock & roll band on earth.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Not an official Rolling Stones release, the assembled band does contain three-fifths of the group (Mick Jagger, Bill Wyman, and Charlie Watts) along with session man extraordinaire Nicky Hopkins and guitarist Ry Cooder. The band stumbles through keyboard-dominated original numbers such as ~Boudoir Stomp~ and ~Edward's Thrump Up,~ as well as more conventional cuts like a cover of Elmore James' ~It Hurts Me Too.~ Yet the songs never get beyond giving the listener the impression they were thrown together during a drunken night's rehearsals. In that sense the album is a bit of a letdown; though any Stones fan would surely clamor for lost material from the band's golden age, Jamming With Edward instead makes one wish it had never been released.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Steve Kurutz</strong></p>"

From that platform, the idea of taking it back to small clubs, live, lean and pared down without succumbing to the worn ~unplugged~ treadmill, seemed an inspired move. Patched together from an embroidery of tour rehearsals and live club dates in Paris and Amsterdam, the project was an extension of acoustic sets the group introduced on the North American leg of the Voodoo Lounge tour. The concept offered an invigorating opportunity to dust off some rough gems from the past that no longer felt at home on scoping stadium stages. Unfortunately, the cover photo depicting a lean, determined, leather-clad combo in spartan black and white proves to be misleading advertising. Within the brave packaging lies a listless, lethargic Dorian Gray bluff. Spongy keyboards gunk many of the tracks. The much-touted cover of Dylan's ~Like a Rolling Stone~ remains pointlessly devoted to the original. There are lazy, somnambulant versions of ~I'm Free~ and ~Let It Bleed~; Keith Richards' painfully intoned ~Slipping Away~; the dozens of lost songs that any fan would chose to have renovated before ~Angie.~</p>&mdash; <b>Roch Parisien</b>"

Where Elvis' set is hurt by the simple fact that there are too many damn Elvis comps on the market, the Rolling Stones benefit greatly from the fact that there has not been any set that chronicles all their recordings from the '60s through the '90s. It also benefits that this is the concept behind the record -- it's meant to be a journey through their biggest songs, not just the number one hits. Of course, the Stones couldn't have had a CD containing just their number ones that spanned one disc, much less two, because they never topped the charts that frequently. This is a liberating thing (compare it to Elvis', which got weighed down with the number ones, resulting in some subpar selections), since it opens the door for almost every Stones song of note to feature on this collection, along with four new songs (not great, but solid songs, all). Sure, there are many great Rolling Stones moments missing, and not just fan favorites Beggars Banquet or Exile on Main St., either -- ~Play With Fire,~ ~2000 Light Years From Home,~ ~Tell Me,~ ~Heart of Stone,~ ~Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker),~ ~Lady Jane,~ ~Time Is on My Side,~ ~Waiting on a Friend,~ ~I'm Free,~ and ~We Love You~ are all missing in action. The thing is, as the disc is playing, you don't miss any of them, and it feels like all the hits are here. At first, the nonchronological order seems to be a mistake, but both discs flow well, especially since they're roughly divided thematically (the first is devoted largely to the '60s, with the rest on the second). Yes, the Stones made great albums that should be in any serious rock collection, but if you just want a summary of their best moments, Forty Licks is it; it does its job as well as Beatles 1 did.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"biography": "<p>Sonny Rollins has remained one of the true jazz giants, ranking up there with Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, and John Coltrane as one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists. He started on piano, took up the alto, and then permanently switched to tenor in 1946. After making his recording debut with Babs Gonzales in 1949, Rollins made a major impact on dates with J.J. Johnson and Bud Powell the same year; the latter session also matched him with Fats Navarro. Rollins' abilities were obvious to the jazz world from the start and he started recording with Miles Davis in 1951 and with Thelonious Monk two years later. After a period out of music, Rollins joined the Max Roach-Clifford Brown quintet in late 1955, continuing after Brownie's death until 1957. From then on, he was always a leader.</p><p>Sonny Rollins' series of brilliant recordings for Prestige, Blue Note, Contemporary, and Riverside in the 1950s found him in peak form and he was acclaimed the top tenor saxophonist of the time, at least until John Coltrane rose to prominence. Therefore, Rollins' decision to drop out of music from 1959-1961 shocked the jazz world. When he came back in 1961 with a quartet featuring Jim Hall, his style was largely unchanged but he soon became a much freer player who was well aware of Ornette Coleman's innovations; he even used Ornette's cornetist Don Cherry for a time. Although his playing was a bit more eccentric than previously, Rollins was a major force until, in 1968, he again decided to retire.</p><p>Upon his return in 1971, Sonny Rollins was more open to the influence of R&B rhythms and pop music, and his recordings since then have not always been essential (often using sidemen not up to his level) but Rollins remains a very vital soloist. His skill at turning unlikely material into jazz, his unaccompanied flights, and his rhythmic freedom and tonal distortions have kept Sonny Rollins one of the masters of jazz. He has literally dozens of superior recordings available.</p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b>",

It gallops through everything -- Carole King tributes (~I Saw the Light~), classic ballads (~Hello It's Me,~ ~It Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference~), Motown (~Wolfman Jack~), blinding power pop (~Couldn't I Just Tell You~), psychedelic hard rock (~Black Maria~), pure weirdness (~I Went to the Mirror~), blue-eyed soul (~Dust in the Wind~), and scores of brilliant songs that don't fall into any particular style (~Cold Morning Light,~ ~It Takes Two to Tango~). It's an amazing journey that's remarkably unpretentious. Rundgren peppers his writing with self-aware, self-deprecating asides, indulging his bizarre sense of humor with gross-outs (~Piss Aaron~) and sheer quirkiness, such as an aural tour of the studio at the beginning of side two. There are a ton of loose ends throughout Something/Anything?, plenty of studio tricks, slight songs (but no filler), snippets of dialogue, and purposely botched beginnings, but all these throwaways simply add context -- they're what makes the album into a kaleidoscopic odyssey through the mind of an insanely gifted pop music obsessive.</P><P>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B></P>"

Associated with the ECM label since the early '70s, Rypdal's playing is definitely an acquired taste, using space and dense sounds in an unusual manner. Classically trained as a pianist, Rypdal was largely self-taught on guitar and originally most influenced by Jimi Hendrix. He attended Oslo University, where he was taught the Lydian chromatic concept of tonal organization by its author, George Russell. Rypdal played with Russell for a time and started an association with Jan Garbarek in the late '60s.</p><p>He formed the group Odyssey in 1972, and has led various small groups since the mid-'70s. An important guitarist and composer in Norway, Terje Rypdal gained a cult following in the United States. He recorded steadily for ECM since 1972 (using such sidemen at times as Garbarek, pianist Bobo Stenson, trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg, bassist Miroslav Vitous, drummer Jack DeJohnette, and cellist David Darling). His two earlier sessions (for the Karusell label in 1968, and a notable 1969 Baden-Baden, Germany, concert put out by MPS) are more difficult to find.</p> &mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b>",

				"review": "<p>Terje Rypdal's recordings offer the listener an astounding array of styles - ranging from straight-ahead jazz played in small-combo settings to solo outings to mind-bending improvisations to orchestral compositions, and all points in between. His composition and playing and arranging are always tasteful and excellent, and the musicians he selects to execute his works are consistently first-rate. BLUE is no exception, falling into a trio of albums featuring roughly the same personnel, The Chasers - Terje on electric guitar (also adding some keyboard touches on this recordings), Bjørn Kjellemyr on electric and acoustic basses, and Audun Kleive on drums and percussion. The same players appear on Terje's previous album, CHASER, and on THE SINGLES COLLECTION (with the addition of Allan Dangerfield on keyboards). This is one of those delightful instances of musicians being so sensitively attuned to each other that they literally perform as a unit, delivering some astonishingly powerful and well-executed performances.Opening with the short intro track 'The curse', then moving deftly into the powerful 'Kompet Går', the set takes the listener through a breathtaking experience featuring both hard-edged and gently beautiful arrangements. Terje's guitar is the only 'lead' instrument in a traditional sense, but the basses and drums of his bandmates are equally in play here. Listen to the funk-driven string-snapping and sliding chords produced by Kjellemyr on 'Kompet Går', and the incredibly precise percussive bursts from Kleive on the same track - they set the stage nicely for Terje's entrance. His playing, as always, is stunning - listen to his trademark attack-muting, as well as his amazing innate melodic sensibilities...and turn it right up! This is an album that deserves extra volume - not to blast the neighbors, but to experience the dynamic subtleties involved.</p><p>As I mentioned, Terje has produced a lot of variations during his long and distinguished career - this is a great straight-ahead album to initiate new listeners, as well as (speaking as a long-time fan of ALL of his work) one of my overall favorites in his catalogue. Also check out (besides the other two with this band, mentioned above), ODYSSEY and WHENEVER I SEEM TO BE FAR AWAY (great early works), AFTER THE RAIN (a solo effort, where Terje plays everything), WAVES and DESCENDRE (his earliest work with frequent collaborator, trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg), EOS (an incredible duet album with cellist David Darling) and LUX AETERNA (his latest, one of his orchestral outings). His catalogue, almost entirely on Manfred Eicher's ECM label, is (thankfully) large and varied - and all of it very, very good.</p>"

				"review": "<p>With over 20 records under his own name and countless more as a collaborator, band member, or guest, guitarist Terje Rypdal has written and performed virtually in all styles of music that emanate from classical or jazz. As an improviser he is a brilliant thinker and spontaneous composer. As a proper composer he has written everything from pop singles to symphonies. Skywards is a return to jazz proper for Rypdal. He surrounds himself with familiar faces for this date, including cellist David Darling, bassist Palle Mikkelborg, Jon Christensen on drums, and Terje Tønnesen on violin. Also employed are Christian Eggen on piano and electronic keyboards and the additional drumming and percussion talents of Paolo Vinaccia. Rypdal's signature guitar sound, present in every moment of his solo breaks, has a soaring, piercing kind of emotional reach. It is indeed ~skyward~ in its sound. On this date he marries postmodern jazz (which sometimes harks back to its swinging past) with European improvisation, his own take on classical music (which sounds more like a Norwegian Morricone than Sibelius), and rock music, to create -- if this is possible -- a newly textured instrumental music that is free of all trappings. Nowhere is this more evident than on ~Out of This World (Sinfonietta),~ where the post-bop jazz in the first movement bleeds into a place where Darling's cello is allowed to break free of its traditional constraints and climb to the heavens along with Rypdal's burning guitar lines, which come as much from Jimi Hendrix as from John McLaughlin. About halfway through, the work moves into the territory of free improvising, before Rypdal brings it back to a processional, theatrical close. What follows are gorgeous, textured ambient balladry, precise salon music, and more free jazz/rock workouts. Skywards is Rypdal's most openly schizophrenic yet satisfyingly ambitious work in many years.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

		"lastname": "Sahm",
		"name": "Doug Sahm",
		"biography": "<p>Born on November 6, 1941, in San Antonio, TX, Doug Sahm was a highly knowledgeable and superbly competent performer of Texan musical styles, whether they be blues, country, rock & roll, Western swing, Cajun, or polkas. A child prodigy, he appeared on radio at the age of five and became a featured player (steel guitar, fiddle, and mandolin) on the the Louisiana Hayride radio program, appearing with stars such as Webb Pierce, Hank Thompson, and Hank Williams. He made his recording debut on the Sarg imprint in 1955 with A Real American Joe under the name of Little Doug Sahm, and within three years was fronting the Pharaohs, the first of several rough-hewn backing groups including the Dell-Kings and the Mar-Kays. Sahm recorded a succession of singles for local labels, including his Little Richard pastiche ~Crazy Daisy~ (1959), ~Just a Moment~ b/w ~Sapphire~ (1961), and ~Lucky Me~ (1963). For several years, Sahm had been pestering producer Huey P. Meaux to record him. Meaux, having success with Barbara Lynn and Dale & Grace, was not interested.</p><p>However, the producer found himself without a market when Beatlemania hit America, and shut himself away in a hotel with the Beatles' records, determined to discover what made them sell. He then called Sahm, told him to grow his hair, form a band, and write a tune with a Cajun two-step beat. Accordingly, Sahm assembled his friends Augie Meyers (keyboards), Frank Morin (saxophone), Harvey Kagen (bass), and Johnny Perez (drums). Meaux gave them an English-sounding name, the Sir Douglas Quintet, and subsequently scored an international hit in 1965 with the catchy ~She's About a Mover.~ The band also had success in the U.S. charts with ~The Rains Came,~ but after being arrested for possession of drugs, they disbanded and Sahm moved to San Francisco, CA, to avoid a heavy fine. He formed the Honkey Blues Band, but had difficulty in getting them on the road. He then gathered the rest of the Sir Douglas Quintet in California for another classic single, ~Mendocino,~ its spoken introduction being characteristic of the hippie era. The album, also called Mendocino, was a forerunner of country-rock. The Sir Douglas Quintet toured Europe and made the successful Together After Five, while Sahm made an excellent country single under the name of Wayne Douglas, ~Be Real.~ He moved to Prunedale in Northern California and befriended a Chicano band, Louie & the Lovers, producing their Rise.</p><p>Sahm, having resolved his problems with the authorities, went back to Texas and released the Sir Douglas Quintet album The Return of Doug Saldaña, the name reflecting his affection for Chicanos. The album, co-produced with Meaux, included an affectionate tribute to Freddy Fender, ~Wasted Days and Wasted Nights,~ which prompted Meaux to resurrect Fender's career and turn him into a country superstar. Sahm appeared with Kris Kristofferson in the movie Cisco Pike, and told his record company that a song he performed, ~Michoacan,~ was about a state in Mexico. Disc jockeys, however, realized that he was actually praising marijuana, and airplay was restricted. Atlantic Records' key producer, Jerry Wexler, decided that progressive country was becoming fashionable and signed both Willie Nelson and Doug Sahm. His high-spirited 1973 album, Doug Sahm and Band, was made in New York with Bob Dylan, Dr. John, and accordionist Flaco Jiménez, and the singer achieved minor success with ~(Is Anybody Going To) San Antone?~ The Sir Douglas Quintet were resurrected intermittently, which resulted in two fine live albums, Wanted Very Much Alive and Back to the 'Dillo. Although it might seem strange that the band should tour with new wave outfit the Pretenders, Sahm's voice and style were possibly an influence on Elvis Costello. Sahm himself stated, ~I'm a part of Willie Nelson's world and at the same time I'm a part of the Grateful Dead's. I don't ever stay in one bag.~</p><p>One of his finest albums was Hell of a Spell, a blues collection dedicated to Guitar Slim. During the mid-'80s Sahm and Meyers worked for the Swedish roots label Sonet Records, releasing several singles and an album that proved highly popular in Scandinavia. Sahm then relocated to Canada, recording the Return of the Formerly Brothers album with guitarist Amos Garrett and pianist Gene Taylor. He returned to Texas in 1988, basing himself at the Antone's blues club in Austin and toured with Jiménez and Angela Strehli as the Texas R&B Revue. In 1990, Sahm formed the Texas Tornados with Meyers, Jiménez, and Fender. Their debut album, which included Sahm's witty ~Who Were You Thinkin' Of?~ and Butch Hancock's ~She Never Spoke Spanish to Me,~ showed that he had lost none of his powers, and subsequent Tornados releases were equally popular. Sahm also inaugurated the Last Real Texas Blues Band, an informal revue that played Tex-Mex and the blues.</p><p>Sahm's lifestyle caught up with him in November 1999, when he was found dead from a heart attack in a New Mexico motel room. He left behind a rich musical legacy, however. Some might regard the Sir Douglas Quintet as one-hit wonders, but in reality Sahm recorded a remarkable catalog of Texas music. Day Dreaming at Midnight was a prime example. This 1994 Sir Douglas Quintet album, featuring his sons Shawn and Shandon and produced by ex-Creedence Clearwater Revival drummer Doug Clifford, was a rousing collection, notable for ~Too Little Too Late~ and the blistering Bob Dylan pastiche ~Dylan Come Lately.~ His death in 1999 was a blow. Many longstanding fans had witnessed a steady artistic growth over the decade, with a notable improvement in his voice.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>All Music</strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>Doug Sahm began his solo career in 1972, after the Sir Douglas Quintet finished its contract with Smash/Mercury and after Atlantic Records co-owner/producer Jerry Wexler convinced him to sign to his label. Wexler gave the Texas maverick the chance to cut a star-studded, big-budget album, shuffling him off to New York where Wexler and Arif Mardin helmed a series of sessions with an ever-revolving cast of musicians featuring Bob Dylan, Dr. John, David ~Fathead~ Newman, David Bromberg, and Flaco Jimenez, in addition to such Sir Doug stalwarts as Augie Meyers and the rhythm section of bassist Jack Barber and drummer George Rains (all but the latter were in the last incarnation of the Quintet, raising the question of whether the group was indeed finished or not, but such is the nature of Sahm's discography). This group cut a lot of material, which was whittled down to the 12-track album Doug Sahm and Band, released in early 1973. At the time, the record received a push from the label and was generally disparaged because of those very all-stars on whose back it was sold, but the years have been kind indeed to the album, and it stands among Sahm's best. Indeed, the heart of the album is not at all far removed from those latter-day Sir Douglas Quintet albums on Mercury, which isn't much of a stretch since Sahm never really strayed from his signature blend of rock & roll, blues, country, and Tejano, but the bigger band and bigger production give the music a different feel -- one that's as loose as the best Quintet material, but off-handedly accomplished and slyly freewheeling. Original reviews noted that there was an overtly country direction on And Band, but that's not really true on an album that has Western swing and rambling country-rock like ~Blues Stay Away from Me~ and the anthemic ~(Is Anybody Going To) San Antone~ jutting up against pure blues in ~Your Friends~ and ~Papa Ain't Salty,~ let alone loose-limbed rockers like ~Dealer's Blues~ and ~I Get Off~ or the skipping Tejano ~Poison Love,~ fueled by Jimenez's addictive accordion.</p><p>These are all convincing arguments that the larger band allowed Sahm to indulge in all of his passions, to the extent of devoting full tracks to each of his favorite sounds -- something that was a bit different than the Quintet records, which usually mixed it all up so it was impossible to tell where one influence ended and another began. That's still true on And Band -- for instance, witness the brilliant cover of Willie Nelson's ~Me and Paul,~ a country song goosed by soulful horns and delivered in a delirious drawl from Sir Doug -- but much of the album finds that signature Sahm sprawl being punctuated by style-specific detours where Sahm seizes the opportunity to stretch out as much as his guests seize the opportunity to jam with this American musical visionary. These are all characteristics of a jam session, which these sessions essentially were -- after all, on this album he only penned three out of the 12 songs -- but relying on covers also points out how Doug Sahm sounds so much like himself, he makes other people's tunes sound as if he wrote them himself. Again, that's something that was true throughout his career, but here it is in sharper relief than most of his records due to the nature of the sessions. And while it's arguable whether this is better than latter-day Sir Douglas Quintet albums -- or such mid-'70s records as Groover's Paradise or Texas Rock for Country Rollers for that matter -- there's no question that this is music that is vividly, excitedly alive and captures Sahm at a peak.

				"review": "<p>The San Francisco Bay Area rock scene of the late '60s was one that encouraged radical experimentation and discouraged the type of mindless conformity that's often plagued corporate rock. When one considers just how different Santana, Jefferson Airplane, Moby Grape, and the Grateful Dead sounded, it becomes obvious just how much it was encouraged. In the mid-'90s, an album as eclectic as Abraxas would be considered a marketing exec's worst nightmare. But at the dawn of the 1970s, this unorthodox mix of rock, jazz, salsa, and blues proved quite successful. Whether adding rock elements to salsa king Tito Puente's ~Oye Como Va,~ embracing instrumental jazz-rock on ~Incident at Neshabur~ and ~Samba Pa Ti,~ or tackling moody blues-rock on Fleetwood Mac's ~Black Magic Woman,~ the band keeps things unpredictable yet cohesive. Many of the Santana albums that came out in the '70s are worth acquiring, but for novices, Abraxas is an excellent place to start.</p>&mdash; <b>Alex Henderson</b>"

				"review": "<p>The 2003 remastered, expanded reissue of the now-legendary collaboration between guitarists Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin can hardly be overstated. A hopelessly misunderstood record in its time by Santana fans -- they were still reeling from the radical direction shift toward jazz on Caravanserai and praying it was an aberration -- it was greeted by Santana devotees with hostility, contrasted with kindness from major-league critics like Robert Palmer. To hear this recording in the context of not only Carlos Santana's development as a guitarist, but as the logical extension of the music of John Coltrane and Miles Davis influencing rock musicians -- McLaughlin, of course, was a former Davis sideman -- this extension makes perfect sense in the post-Sonic Youth, post-rock era. With the exception of Coltrane's ~Naima~ and McLaughlin's ~Meditation,~ this album consists of merely three extended guitar jams played on the spiritual ecstasy tip -- both men were devotees of guru Shri Chinmoy at the time. The assembled band included members of Santana's band and the Mahavishnu Orchestra in Michael Shrieve, Billy Cobham, Doug Rauch, Armando Peraza, Jan Hammer (playing drums!), and Don Alias. But it is the presence of the revolutionary jazz organist Larry Young -- a colleague of McLaughlin's in Tony Williams' Lifetime band -- that makes the entire project gel. He stands as the great communicator harmonically between the two very different guitarists whose ideas contrasted enough to complement one another in the context of Young's aggressive approach to keep the entire proceeding in the air. In the acknowledgement section of Coltrane's ~A Love Supreme,~ which opens the album -- and on its alternate take added here -- Young creates a channel between Santana's riotous, transcendent, melodic runs, and McLaughlin's rapid-fire machine-gun riffing. Young' double-handed striated chord voicings offered enough for both men to chew on, leaving free-ranging territory for percussive effects to drive the tracks from underneath. Check ~Let Us Go Into the House of the Lord,~ which was musically inspired by Bobby Womack's ~Breezing,~ and dynamically foreshadowed by Pharoah Sanders' read of it, or the insanely knotty yet intervallically transcendent ~The Life Divine,~ for the manner in which Young's organ actually speaks both languages simultaneously. On this ~remaster,~ one can hear Young's real contribution to the sessions for the first time: he is mixed much higher here allowing all of his otherworldly chords, syncopations, and harmonic inventions to be heard at their proper weights. Young is the person who makes the room for the deep spirituality inherent in these sessions to be grasped for what it is: the interplay of two men who were not merely paying tribute to Coltrane, but trying to take his ideas about going beyond the realm of Western music to communicate with the language of the heart as it united with the cosmos. After three decades, Love Devotion Surrender still sounds completely radical and stunningly, movingly beautiful.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

Born in 1964 and raised in the Niagara Falls area, he started his first band at the age of 14, and within a few years earned his first regular gig at an area club. Influenced by Pete Seeger, he began making the rounds on the folk circuit, but soon decided to focus his attentions on becoming a songwriter.</p><P>After moving to the Toronto area, Sexsmith formed the Uncool and began issuing his own material in 1985 with the cassette Out of the Duff, followed a year later by There's a Way. He continued performing while maintaining a day job as a courier but did not release anything more until 1991's <I>Grand Opera Lane</I>, recorded by Blue Rodeo's Bob Wiseman. The collection of songs helped earn Sexsmith a songwriting contract, and eventually a recording deal with Interscope Records; teamed with producer Mitchell Froom, he released his self-titled debut in 1995. A follow-up, <I>Other Songs</I>, appeared two years later. In 1999, Sexsmith returned with <I>Whereabouts</I>, again produced by Froom. Three years later, Sexsmith inked a deal with Nettwerk and released Cobblestone Runway in October 2002. His seventh album, Retriever, followed two years later.</p><b> &mdash; All Music</b>",

After escaping the tape-loop jungle of Mitchell Froom's production on his first three major-label albums, Sexsmith has seen his music matched with the roots-oriented pop approach of <I>Blue Boy</I> and the subtle electronic textures of <I>Cobblestone Runway</I>, each successful but in decidedly different ways. At first listen, Sexsmith's sixth album, <I>Retriever</I>, sounds like an attempt to move back to the style of <I>Other Songs</I> or <I>Whereabouts</I>, but without the production excesses of those sessions; many of themelodies boast '60s-influenced pop hooks, and Martin Terefe's production subtly reinforces the Beatlesque qualities of the music, with occasional side trips into the land of '70s singer/songwriters (~Whatever It Takes~ could almost pass for a lost Bill Withers track). But the results have a more open and organic feel than Froom's thematically similar work, employing real strings and less cluttered arrangements, and Sexsmith sounds quite comfortable in these surroundings.</p><p>While Sexsmith sounded decidedly awkward and self-conscious as a singer on his early albums, he's grown into a vocalist who delivers his material with a genuine and compelling commitment on his recent albums, and <I>Retriever</I> sounds like his most confident and accomplished set to date. And as a writer, Sexsmith is still gloriously one of a kind, a man who can write about love without sounding either cloying or bitter, and can document both the bright and dark sides of life with honesty, heart, and clear perception. Most songwriters could go their whole careers without penning a song as strong as ~How on Earth,~ ~Imaginary Friends,~ or ~For the Driver,~ and those are just three of the highpoints on <I>Retriever</I>; if you know Sexsmith's work, then you already have a good idea of how good this album is, and if you don't, this is a fine place to get acquainted.</p> — <B>Mark Deming</B>"

		"biography": "<p>Though some will argue about whether Wayne Shorter's primary impact on jazz has been as a composer or as a saxophonist, hardly anyone will dispute his overall importance as one of jazz's leading figures over a long span of time. Though indebted to a great extent to John Coltrane, with whom he practiced in the mid-'50s while still an undergraduate, Shorter eventually developed his own more succinct manner on tenor sax, retaining the tough tone quality and intensity and, in later years, adding an element of funk. On soprano, Shorter is almost another player entirely, his lovely tone shining like a light beam, his sensibilities attuned more to lyrical thoughts, his choice of notes becoming more spare as his career unfolded. Shorter's influence as a player, stemming mainly from his achievements in the 1960s and '70s, has been tremendous upon the neo-bop brigade who emerged in the early '80s, most notably Branford Marsalis. As a composer, he is best known for carefully conceived, complex, long-limbed, endlessly winding tunes, many of which have become jazz standards yet have spawned few imitators.</p><p>Shorter started on the clarinet at 16 but switched to tenor sax before entering New York University in 1952. After graduating with a BME in 1956, he played with Horace Silver for a short time until he was drafted into the Army for two years. Once out of the service, he joined Maynard Ferguson's band, meeting Ferguson's pianist Joe Zawinul in the process. The following year (1959), Shorter joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, where he remained until 1963, eventually becoming the band's music director. During the Blakey period, Shorter also made his debut on records as a leader, cutting several albums for Chicago's Vee-Jay label. After a few prior attempts to hire him away from Blakey, Miles Davis finally convinced Shorter to join his Quintet in September 1964, thus completing the lineup of a group whose biggest impact would leap-frog a generation into the '80s.</p><p>Staying with Miles until 1970, Shorter became at times the band's most prolific composer, contributing tunes like ~E.S.P.,~ ~Pinocchio,~ ~Nefertiti,~ ~Sanctuary,~ ~Footprints,~ ~Fall~ and the signature description of Miles, ~Prince of Darkness.~ While playing through Miles' transition from loose post-bop acoustic jazz into electronic jazz-rock, Shorter also took up the soprano in late 1968, an instrument which turned out to be more suited to riding above the new electronic timbres than the tenor. As a prolific solo artist for Blue Note during this period, Shorter expanded his palette from hard bop almost into the atonal avant-garde, with fascinating excursions into jazz/rock territory toward the turn of the decade.</p><p>In November 1970, Shorter teamed up with old cohort Joe Zawinul and Miroslav Vitous to form Weather Report, where after a fierce start, Shorter's playing grew mellower, pithier, more consciously melodic, and gradually more subservient to Zawinul's concepts. By now, he was playing mostly on soprano, though the tenor would re-emerge more toward the end of WR's run. Shorter's solo ambitions were mostly on hold during the WR days, resulting in but one atypical solo album, Native Dancer, an attractive side trip into Brazilian-American tropicalismo in tandem with Milton Nascimento. Shorter also revisited the past in the late '70s by touring with Freddie Hubbard and ex-Miles sidemen Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams as V.S.O.P.</p><p>Shorter finally left Weather Report in 1985, but promptly went into a creative slump from which he has yet to fully recover. Still committed to electronics and fusion, his recorded compositions from this point became more predictable and labored, saddled with leaden rhythm sections and overly complicated arrangements. After three routine Columbia albums during 1986-1988, and a tour with Santana, he lapsed into silence, finally emerging in 1992 with Wallace Roney and the V.S.O.P. rhythm section in the ~A Tribute to Miles~ band. In 1994, now on Verve, Shorter released High Life, a somewhat more engaging collaboration with keyboardist Rachel Z. In concert, he has fielded an erratic series of bands, which could be incoherent one year (1995), and lean and fit the next (1996). He guested on the Rolling Stones' Bridges to Babylon in 1997, and on Herbie Hancock's Gershwin's World in 1998. In 2001, he was back with Herbie for Future 2 Future and on Marcus Miller's M². 2002 saw the release of Footprints Live! under his own name, followed by Alegría in 2003 and Beyond the Sound Barrier in 2005. Given his long track record, Shorter's every record and appearance are still eagerly awaited by fans in the hope that he will thrill them again.</p>&mdash; <b>Richard S. Ginell</b>",

The Best of Wayne Shorter, which was released in 1998 within a series of other Blue Note best-ofs that were coming out at the time, is adequate, but with only one disc it's hard to cover any ground with a guy who's recorded around a dozen top-notch records as a leader for Blue Note, and then appeared on scores of others -- and that's where this collection wins. The second disc consists of appearances he made alongside such greats as Art Blakey, Lee Morgan, and Freddie Hubbard. Perhaps a Blue Note Wayne Shorter box set is in order? At any rate, ~Speak No Evil,~ ~Footprints,~ ~Witch Hunt,~ and ~Nefertiti~ prove to highlight Wayne Shorter's astounding career and in turn show off jazz composition in general -- as Shorter stands as the one of the genre's best songwriters. Recommended as a springboard into the full-length discs these tracks are culled from, The Classic Blue Note Recordings of Wayne Shorter hits the mark.</p>&mdash; <b>Jack LV Isles</b>"

Inspired by Hank Williams and Hank Snow, he taught himself to play guitar while in his teens. By the early '60s, after serving in the military, he began playing folk clubs, eventually moving to Greenwich Village, where he found support in the coffeehouse circuit. In 1969, a collections of demos he made with David Bromberg caught the attention of Elektra Records owner Jac Holzman, who offered a him a modest recording deal (reportedly he was only given enough money to finance four three-hour recording sessions). The resulting album, Woodsmoke and Oranges, was met with critical praise from the media, including Rolling Stone magazine. Despite the attention, the album and its equally praised follow-up, Jack-Knife Gypsy, sold disappointingly little.

That, however, didn't mean he couldn't make a great album, so Elektra matched the songsmith with producer Peter K. Siegel and turned them loose in the studio. With a shoestring budget, the two men gathered a handful of fine musicians — including guitarist David Bromberg, violinist Richard Greene, and steel guitarist Weldon Myrick — to record ten Siebel originals quickly. Despite, or because of, the small budget and lack of time, Siebel and company crafted an incredible record that still sounds vibrant 30 years after the fact. Woodsmoke and Oranges begins with three gems, the up-tempo ~She Made Me Lose My Blues,~ the jazzy ~Miss Cherry Lane,~ and the road song ~Nashville Again.~ Everything works in harmony here — Siebel's songs, the vocals, and the sparkling, multi-layered arrangements. In fact, throughout the album, the arrangements seem to push the singer forward to deliver taut, heartfelt performances. The slower ballads equal the upbeat material, with nods going to ~Louise~ and ~Long Afternoons.~ Like John Prine, Siebel is a singer/songwriter who has serious things on his mind, but doesn't forget to write memorable melodies to accompany the words. Although he'd never outdo his work on Woodsmoke and Oranges, few artists ever craft an album this good.</P><P>— <B>Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr.</B></P><HR><p>The first record may have drawn listeners for the opportunity to hear Siebel originals of songs they knew from elsewhere. This record does not have that same kind of pull but is every bit as good. His strong sense of melody and storytelling style paved the way for such current songwriters as Butch Hancock and Robert Earl Keen.</p>&mdash; <b>Jim Worbois</b>"

From the opening cut, ~Mother and Child Reunion~ (a Top Ten hit), Simon, who had snuck several subtle musical explorations into the generally conservative S&amp;G sound, broke free, heralding the rise of reggae with an exuberant track recorded in Jamaica for a song about death. From there, it was off to Paris for a track in South American style and a rambling story of a fisherman's son, ~Duncan~ (which made the singles chart). But most of the album had a low-key feel, with Simon on acoustic guitar backed by only a few trusted associates (among them Joe Osborn, Larry Knechtel, David Spinozza, Mike Manieri, Ron Carter, and Hal Blaine, along with such guests as Stefan Grossman, Airto Moreira, and Stephane Grappelli), singing a group of informal, intimate, funny, and closely observed songs (among them the lively Top 40 hit ~Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard~). It was miles removed from the big, stately ballad style of Bridge Over Troubled Water and signaled that Simon was a versatile songwriter as well as an expressive singer with a much broader range of musical interests than he had previously demonstrated. You didn't miss Art Garfunkel on Paul Simon, not only because Simon didn't write Garfunkel-like showcases for himself, but because the songs he did write showed off his own, more varied musical strengths. [In 2004, Warner Strategic Marketing reissued Simon's studio albums as remastered editions with bonus tracks, packaged in a cardboard digipack. The remastering on Paul Simon is particularly startling &mdash; it's crystal clear, yet warm, easily the best-sounding version of this album yet pressed. The three previously unreleased bonus tracks on Paul Simon are also revelatory, containing a demo of ~Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard~ with a different verse and a radically different version of ~Duncan,~ which contains a different narrative than the final version. The third bonus track is an alternate version of ~Paranoia Blues~ that is more relaxed and laid-back than the album version.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

		"biography": "<p>Sly & the Family Stone harnessed all of the disparate musical and social trends of the late '60s, creating a wild, brilliant fusion of soul, rock, R&B, psychedelia, and funk that broke boundaries down without a second thought. Led by Sly Stone, the Family Stone was comprised of men and women, and blacks and whites, making the band the first fully integrated group in rock's history. That integration shone through the music, as well as the group's message. Before Stone, very few soul and R&B groups delved into political and social commentary; after him, it became a tradition in soul, funk, and hip-hop. And, along with James Brown, Stone brought hard funk into the mainstream. The Family Stone's arrangements were ingenious, filled with unexpected group vocals, syncopated rhythms, punchy horns, and pop melodies. Their music was joyous, but as the '60s ended, so did the good times. Stone became disillusioned with the ideals he had been preaching in his music, becoming addicted to a variety of drugs in the process. His music gradually grew slower and darker, culminating in 1971's <i>There's a Riot Going On</i>, which set the pace for '70s funk with its elastic bass, slurred vocals, and militant Black Power stance. Stone was able to turn out one more modern funk classic, 1973's <i>Fresh</i>, before slowly succumbing to his addictions, which gradually sapped him of his once prodigious talents. Nevertheless, his music continued to provide the basic template for urban soul, funk, and even hip-hop well into the '90s.</p><p>Sly Stone (born Sylvester Stewart, March 15, 1944) and his family moved from his home state of Texas to San Francisco in the '50s. He had already begun to express an interest in music, and when he was 16, he had a regional hit with ~Long Time Away.~ Stone studied music composition, theory, and trumpet at Vallejo Junior College in the early '60s; simultaneously, he began playing in several groups on the Bay Area scene, often with his brother Fred. Soon, he had become a disc jockey at the R&B station KSOL, later switching to KDIA. The radio appearances led to a job producing records for Autumn Records. While at Autumn, he worked with a number of San Franciscan garage and psychedelic bands, including the Beau Brummels, the Great Society, Bobby Freeman, and the Mojo Men.</p><p>During 1966, Stone formed the Stoners, which featured trumpeter Cynthia Robinson. Though the Stoners didn't last long, he brought Robinson along as one of the core members of his next group, Sly & the Family Stone. Formed in early 1967, the Family Stone also featured Fred Stewart (guitar, vocals), Larry Graham Jr. (bass, vocals), Greg Errico (drums), Jerry Martini (saxophone), and Rosie Stone (piano), who all were of different racial backgrounds. The group's eclectic music and multiracial composition made them distinctive from the numerous flower-power bands in San Francisco, and their first single, ~I Ain't Got Nobody,~ became a regional hit for the local label Loadstone. The band signed with Epic Records shortly afterward, releasing their debut album, <i>A Whole New Thing</i>, by the end of the year. The record stiffed, but the follow-up, <i>Dance to the Music</i>, generated a Top Ten pop and R&B hit with its title track early in 1968. Life followed later in 1968, but the record failed to capitalize on its predecessor's success. ~Everyday People,~ released late in 1968, turned their fortunes back around, rocketing to the top of the pop and R&B charts and setting the stage for the breakthrough success of 1969's <i>Stand!</i></p><p>Featuring ~Everyday People,~ ~Sing a Simple Song,~ ~Stand,~ and ~I Want to Take You Higher,~ <i>Stand!</i> became the Family Stone's first genuine hit album, climbing to number 13 and spending over 100 weeks on the charts. <i>Stand!</i> also marked the emergence of the political bent in Stone's songwriting (~Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey~), as well as the development of hard-edged, improvisational funk like ~Sex Machine.~ The Family Stone quickly became known as one of the best live bands of the late '60s, and their performance at Woodstock was widely hailed as one of the festival's best. The non-LP singles ~Hot Fun in the Summertime~ and ~Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)~ b/w ~Everybody Is a Star~ became hits, reaching number two and number one respectively in late 1969/early 1970. Both singles were included on <i>Greatest Hits</i>, which became a number two record upon its fall 1970 release. While the group was at the height of its popularity, Sly was beginning to unravel behind the scenes. Developing a debilitating addiction to narcotics, Stone soon became notorious for arriving late for concerts, frequently missing the shows all together.</p><p>Stone's growing personal problems, as well as his dismay with the slow death of the civil rights movement and other political causes, surfaced on <i>There's a Riot Goin' On</i>. Though the album shot to number one upon its fall 1971 release, the record - including ~Family Affair,~ Stone's last number one single - was dark, hazy, and paranoid, and his audience began to shrink slightly. During 1972, several key members of the Family Stone, including Graham and Errico, left the band; they were replaced by Rusty Allen and Andy Newmark, respectively. The relatively lighter <i>Fresh</i> appeared in the summer of 1973, and it went into the Top Ten on the strength of the Top Ten R&B hit ~If You Want Me to Stay.~ Released the following year, <i>Small Talk</i> was a moderate hit, reaching number 15 on the charts and going gold, but it failed to generate a big hit single. <i>High on You</i>, released in late 1975 and credited only to Sly Stone, confirmed that his power and popularity had faded. ~I Get High on You~ reached the R&B Top Ten, but the album made no lasting impact.</p><p>Disco had overtaken funk in terms of popularity, and even if Sly wanted to compete with disco, he wasn't in shape to make music. He had become addicted to cocaine, his health was frequently poor, and he was often in trouble with the law. His recordings had slowed to a trickle, and Epic decided to close out his contract in 1979 with <i>Ten Years Too Soon</i>, a compilation of previously released material that had the original funky rhythm tracks replaced with disco beats. Stone signed with Warner Brothers that same year, crafting the comeback effort <i>Back on the Right Track</i> with several original members of the Family Stone, but the record was critically panned and a commercial failure. In light of the album's lack of success, Stone retreated even further, eventually joining forces with George Clinton on Funkadelic's 1981 album <i>The Electric Spanking of War Babies</i>. Following the album's release, Stone toured with Clinton's P-Funk All-Stars, which led him to embark on his own tour, as well as a stint with Bobby Womack. The culmination of this burst of activity was 1983's <i>Ain't but the One Way</i>, an album that was ignored. Later that year, Stone was arrested for cocaine possession; the following year, he entered rehab.</p><p>Stone appeared on Jesse Johnson's 1986 R&B hit ~Crazay.~ The following year, he dueted with Martha Davis on ~Love & Affection~ for the Soul Man soundtrack; he also he recorded ~Eek-a-Bo-Static,~ a single that didn't chart. Stone was arrested and imprisoned for cocaine possession by the end of 1987, and he was never able to recover from the final arrest. Stone continued to battle his addiction, with varying degrees of success. By his 1993 induction to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, he had disappeared from public view. Following his appearance at the induction ceremony, he was found living in a sheltered-housing complex. Avenue Records gave Stone a recording contract in 1995, but nothing would be recorded.</p>&mdash;<b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>",

				"review": "<p>It's easy to write off <i>There's a Riot Goin' On</i> as one of two things — Sly Stone's disgusted social commentary or the beginning of his slow descent into addiction. It's both of these things, of course, but pigeonholing it as either winds up dismissing the album as a whole, since it is so bloody hard to categorize. What's certain is that Riot is unlike any of Sly & the Family Stone's other albums, stripped of the effervescence that flowed through even such politically aware records as <i>Stand!</i>. This is idealism soured, as hope is slowly replaced by cynicism, joy by skepticism, enthusiasm by weariness, sex by pornography, thrills by narcotics. Joy isn't entirely gone — it creeps through the cracks every once and awhile and, more disturbing, Sly revels in his stoned decadence. What makes Riot so remarkable is that it's hard not to get drawn in with him, as you're seduced by the narcotic grooves, seductive vocals slurs, leering electric pianos, and crawling guitars. As the themes surface, it's hard not to nod in agreement, but it's a junkie nod, induced by the comforting coma of the music. And damn if this music isn't funk at its deepest and most impenetrable — this is dense music, nearly impenetrable, but not from its deep grooves, but its utter weariness. Sly's songwriting remains remarkably sharp, but only when he wants to write — the foreboding opener ~Luv N' Haight,~ the scarily resigned ~Family Affair,~ the cracked cynical blues ~Time,~ and ~(You Caught Me) Smilin'.~ Ultimately, the music is the message and while it's dark music, it's not alienating — it's seductive despair, and that's the scariest thing about it. &mdash;<b></b>"

		"biography": "<p>The Small Faces were the best English band never to hit it big in America. On this side of the Atlantic, all anybody remembers them for is their sole stateside hit, ~Itchycoo Park,~ which was hardly representative of their psychedelic sound, much less their full musical range -- but in England, the Small Faces were one of the most extraordinary and successful bands of the mid-'60s, serious competitors to the Who and potential rivals to the Rolling Stones.Lead singer/guitarist Steve Marriott's formal background was on the stage; as a young teenager, he'd auditioned for and won the part of the Artful Dodger in the Lionel Bart musical Oliver! Marriott was earning his living at a music shop when he made the acquaintance of Ronnie Lane (bass, backing vocals), who had formed a band called the Pioneers, which included drummer Kenney Jones. Lane invited Marriott to jam with his band at a show they were playing at a local club -- the gig was a disaster, but out of that show the group members decided to turn their talents toward American R&B. The band -- with Marriott now installed permanently and Jimmy Winston recruited on organ -- cast its lot with a faction of British youth known as the mods, stylish posers (and arch enemies of the leather-clad rockers, sometimes with incredibly violent results) who, among their other attributes, affected a dandified look and a fanatical embrace of American R&B. The quartet, now christened the Small Faces (~face~ being a piece of mod slang for a fashion leader), began making a name for themselves on-stage, sparked by their no holds barred performance style. Marriott had a uniquely powerful voice and was also a very aggressive lead guitarist, and the others were able to match him, especially Jones, who was a truly distinctive drummer.The quartet was signed by manager Don Arden who, through his management company, got the Small Faces a record deal with Decca/London. The band's debut single, ~What'cha Gonna Do About It,~ a blatant ripoff of Solomon Burke's ~Everybody Needs Somebody to Love,~ co-credited in this version to longtime British songwriter/producer Ian Samwell, was released in August of 1965 and reached number 14 on the charts; a second single, ~I've Got Mine,~ failed to chart when released in November. Soon after its recording, Winston exited the lineup; he was replaced by Ian McLagan (organ, guitar, vocals). The group returned to the charts in February of 1966 with ~Sha-La-La-La-Lee,~ which rose to number three in England. Three months later, they were back at number ten with ~Hey Girl,~ a Marriott/Lane composition that inaugurated the songwriting team, a development strongly encouraged by their manager, who appreciated the enhanced earnings that original hits enjoyed. This single heralded their first album, a rather hastily recorded long-player entitled Small Faces. Their real breakthrough came with the next single, another Marriott/Lane original, entitled ~All or Nothing,~ which topped the U.K. charts in the course of a ten-week run. Its follow-up, ~My Mind's Eye,~ was successful as well, but its release infuriated the bandmembers, because as far as they were concerned, it was unfinished -- they'd furnished a demo to Arden who, in turn, had turned it over to Decca as a finished piece, and the latter had released it. That release brought to a head the group's growing alienation from their manager, over his handling of their business affairs and bookings, as well as their relations with Decca. Despite their string of five hits, Arden was treating the group as a nonrenewable resource, booking them too many shows -- as many as three a night -- as though they had no future and had to earn fees while the fees were being offered. This, in turn, prevented Marriott and Lane from exploring their full potential as songwriters, and in 1966, with albums like Rubber Soul and Revolver emanating from the Beatles and Aftermath from the Rolling Stones, songwriting was becoming an essential activity for any band that could do it. Further, the group had evolved both musically and intellectually from their beginnings -- by the spring of 1966, in place of the occasional weed or amphetamine (the latter an essential part of the mod lifestyle), they'd begun experimenting with LSD and, like many other artists, found their work and sensibilities altered by it -- they could still do the soul numbers on-stage, and write passages in that vein for themselves to play and sing, but the subject matter of their songs, even when they did concern love, became decidedly more complex and experimental, along with their sound.</p><p>This is where Arden and Decca Records' treatment of them really began to grate on the bandmembers, because their manager didn't feel like budgeting for anything more than the standard, union-dictated three-hour sessions with breaks, hopefully yielding at least a song per session, and they had songs in mind now, and sounds to go with them, that were too bold to be worked out in three hours. Despite four hit singles to their credit, they'd been given less time to complete their debut LP than the Rolling Stones -- who'd abandoned Decca's studios, with their iron-clad union rules and engineers who wouldn't let them play at full volume, in favor of RCA Studios in Hollywood -- usually got to complete one of their singles. And, finally, between the recording costs at Decca and Arden's way of handling their finances, the Small Faces weren't seeing much money, considering their chart successes to date. By the end of 1966, the Small Faces had severed their ties with Arden which, in effect, ended their relationship with Decca (though the two sides would argue and debate that point for a while), and in early 1967 moved under the wing of Rolling Stones manager/producer Andrew Loog Oldham. At the time, Oldham was one of the top three or four producers in England, thanks to his work with the Stones (and a few other acts such as Marianne Faithfull), and his management of that group was considered one of the most successful business relationships in pop music. Oldham had started his own label, Immediate Records, which was so far devoted to a few licensed American masters, the work of promising neophytes, and a few unwitting contributions by star guitarists -- including Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck -- who thought they were cutting demos and jamming with producer/guitarist Jimmy Page. Getting the Small Faces as clients was the first step to getting them onto his label, thereby providing the label with the anchor of a proven hitmaking outfit (the Rolling Stones were locked into their Decca Records contract and, in any case, usually seemed to keep themselves at arm's length from Immediate's activities, beyond any informal obligations they felt they owed Oldham). By mid-1967 he had succeeded in doing precisely that, signing the group to Immediate -- and with the shift in management and label, the Small Faces suddenly found themselves with a drastically reduced touring schedule and vastly increased time available in the studio, and their sound immediately became looser. They started things off of just right for the new era with one of the most quietly subversive drug anthems ever to tiptoe its way into the U.K. charts, ~Here Comes the Nice.~ A cheerful, unassuming ode to a drug dealer, it somehow escaped the notice of censors and became one of the finest above-board expressions of appreciation for recreational drug use of its era. There were other drug songs to follow, including ~Green Circles,~ that ended up on their albums -- they remained a top-flight R&B-driven band, but a much wider array of sounds and instruments began figuring in their music. Their first Immediate album, entitled Small Faces (known in the U.S., where it was released somewhat belatedly through Columbia Records' distribution, as There Are But Four Small Faces), was issued in mid-1967, and was an instant hit. In August of that year, two months after ~Here Comes the Nice~ wafted its way to the airwaves, they released ~Itchycoo Park,~ a lilting, lyrical idyll to the Summer of Love, loosely based on a hymn known to Ronnie Lane and featuring Marriott in his gentlest vocal guise -- this ode to a psychedelic sunny afternoon captured the hearts of listeners on both sides of the Atlantic and became the Small Faces' sole claim to fame in the United States.</p><p>Ironically, although they were always glad to have a hit, the bandmembers weren't entirely pleased with the single's success, because they felt the song didn't represent their true sound, and it was also extremely difficult to play on-stage, owing to its acoustic guitar sound and varied musical textures. What's more, the band had bigger aspirations than doing more hit singles -- the Beatles' success with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band had set the album up as the new primary medium for musical expression, and they were eager to get to work on a canvas that size. Across five months during 1968, in at least four different studios, they recorded what proved to be their magnum opus, Ogden's Nut Gone Flake. A mix of Cockney whimsy, spoken word recitations (courtesy of actor/recitalist Stanley Unwin), hard rock, blue-eyed soul, and druggy freakbeat sensibilities, it was probably the most English and the most ambitious of the concept albums that followed in the wake of Sgt. Pepper's, and further enticed potential purchasers (and confounded record distributors and retailers, not to mention American listeners totally unfamiliar with the actual Ogden's tobacco tins) with its round-sleeve-in-a-square-frame packaging. The resulting album -- which the group only performed in its entirety once (although numbers like ~Rollin' Over~ became permanent parts of their stage set), in a live-in-the-studio television broadcast called Colour Me Pop -- was a critical and commercial success, and has received new cycles of rave reviews across the decades since. The group's fortunes didn't match the reception for the album, however -- in June of 1968, to announce the release of the album, Immediate took out an ad in the music trade papers that included a parody of the Lord's Prayer that managed to offend several million people before an apology from the band was issued. Their relationship with Immediate was further strained when, over the objections of Marriott, the label released the song ~Lazy Sunday~ -- which he'd recorded as a joke -- as a single. Its subsequent rise to number two on the British charts did nothing to ease his unhappiness, as the record really had nothing to do with the band's real sound. Their previous single, ~Tin Soldier~ -- which was a hit as well -- was much more what they were about, a love song mixing wrenchingly soulful vocals by Marriott and almost psychedelic sensibilities in the lyrics, with a dazzling, pounding, driving performance by McLagan at the keyboard.The group members were also beginning to have their doubts about Oldham and Immediate. The producer/manager had parted company with the Rolling Stones in mid-1967, with the result that the Small Faces became the creative core of the label (and the sole cash cow in Oldham's orbit). Whereas the Mick Jagger/Keith Richards songwriting team had contributed songs to some early Immediate acts, suddenly Marriott and Lane were being asked to come up with songs and serve as producers, which would have been OK except that, even with a fresh string of hit singles and a pair of LPs that sold well, they were getting no royalties -- Immediate was keeping much of what their recordings earned, all charged against their studio time at very high rates, though the group was at least getting more money from fewer but much better-paying gigs. The reality of the record business is that, to some extent, every label pads the books -- as in the film industry, where expenses from box office bombs, or for ordinary day-to-day operations, somehow manage to get written off against the revenue generated by the hits, the record labels all manage to shift some losses to money-making acts' fees. The problem for the Small Faces was that they were the only money-making act on Immediate. Everything else was hit or miss (and most often miss), some records by the Nice at one point and some early singles by P.P. Arnold and some American-licensed sides by the McCoys, Van Morrison, et al., succeeding, but most losing money.And the label itself literally hemorrhaged money, in ways that paralleled the debacle at Apple Records. In one of the more famous anecdotes, attributed to various artists under contract and also to former employees, the typical daily operation went like this: artists and would-be artists hanging out and major stars popping in and out, and then at 4 p.m. or so Oldham would arrive in a limo, dressed in a kaftan and sandals, accompanied by an entourage, and his business partner, Tony Calder, would show up separately, go into the office, look at the bills, and start muttering about breaking people's legs. The Small Faces' royalties mostly vanished into that black hole up until the inevitable bankruptcy, and then simply vanished for 30 years.~The Universal,~ a single released in the summer of 1968, was to have been Marriott's most serious effort in that vein in over a year, incorporating a more laid-back, quasi-acoustic, and jazz-like sound (complete with clarinet accompaniment) and his most subtle, serious lyrics, in contrast to the jocular ~Lazy Sunday~; it subsequently failed to crack the Top 20, and much of his interest in continuing with the band seemed to falter as a result. The group worked on a planned third Immediate LP and continued to tour (Immediate even recorded one of their live sets from Newcastle Town Hall early in the year, which showed a band as good as any in England), and Marriott tried to institute some changes -- he even proposed that a new friend, singer/guitarist Peter Frampton, a teen idol who had lately quit a successful pop/rock band called the Herd in a quest to be taken more seriously as an artist, be brought into the Small Faces lineup, but the others were content to continue as a quartet. The end came soon after, in the final hours of 1968, when Marriott suddenly left the stage while the band was jamming to ~Lazy Sunday~ during a show at the Alexandria Palace; within hours, he and Frampton began mapping plans for a band of their own called Humble Pie, bringing aboard Greg Ridley on bass and Jerry Shirley -- a Marriott musical protégé, Kenney Jones admirer, and former member of a Small Faces-influenced band called the Apostolic Intervention -- on drums. The Small Faces did carry on into 1969, and Immediate tried to salvage its situation by issuing a double-LP career retrospective called The Autumn Stone, which made it out a few months before the company closed its doors.</p><p>With Marriott gone, the group needed a replacement singer and lead guitarist and divided up the two jobs, finding artists to fill them in Rod Stewart and Ron Wood. Immediate having sunk below the waves in a sea of long-delayed bankruptcy proceedings, the new group moved to the much bigger and more stable auspices of Warner Bros. Records; the name ~Small Faces~ endured, attached to one Warner album before they officially morphed into the Faces, an incarnation under which they went on to international glory for a time, before Rod Stewart finally eclipsed them as a solo act. During the mid-'70s, the Small Faces reunited (with a somewhat limited participation by Lane) for two albums, Playmates and 78 in the Shade, that attracted a lot of press attention but nothing resembling the chart action of their earlier releases, and, like their 1960s work, those records failed to find an audience in America, despite being released on Atlantic Records. Ironically, at the very same time, the charts and the press on both sides of the Atlantic were filled by punk and power pop acts whose respective sounds and images often owed a huge amount to the Small Faces' groundbreaking work.</p><p>Lane recorded with Pete Townshend, among others, before contracting multiple sclerosis, which ended his career as a musician (he later organized the ARMS benefit concerts to raise money for research toward a cure for the disease). Jones subsequently joined the Who, having been recommended by Keith Moon as his replacement ahead of the legendary drummer's sudden death in 1978, and did a couple of tours and a pair of albums with the band. Humble Pie became bigger in America than the Small Faces had ever been with their brand of high-energy rock & roll, which soon alienated co-founder Frampton but led to massive sales and an enviable string of tours, until their breakup in 1975. Steve Marriott's career languished a bit in the years that followed, but he always seemed poised for a comeback -- with that voice and history, he was always a potential contender for stardom -- and in 1991 it looked as though he was going to finally pull it off. Alas, he died in his sleep when fire swept his home in England, tragically just a couple of days after beginning work on a new album in America with his former bandmate Frampton. Ronnie Lane died at his home in Trinidad, CO, on June 4, 1997, after battling multiple sclerosis for nearly 20 years. In 1998, Ian McLagan -- who'd gone on from the Faces to record and perform with Bonnie Raitt, the Rolling Stones, et al. -- published All the Rage, a very frank and revealing autobiography covering his 35 years in professional music. The Small Faces' catalog languished for a time, largely as a result of the bankruptcy of Immediate Records in 1970. Some of their stuff was reissued on vinyl in Canada in the early- to mid-'70s, and later on reissue labels such as Compleat, but their legacy was generally in a shambles. That wasn't helped in the early part of the CD era when the licensors of the Immediate catalog sent out a lot of substandard masters, made from sources a long way from first-generation studio tapes, to their clients. In 1990, Sony Music Special Products became the first label to reissue any part of the Small Faces' catalog mastered from decent tapes, utilizing the duplicate masters that Immediate had furnished to Columbia Records -- the predecessor to Sony -- in the late '60s. The results were better, if not ideal, but eventually, a combination of consumer complaints and better vault research in England, coupled with better digital technology, led to major improvements in their CD library; anything dating from much after 1995 is acceptable by early 21st century standards, and some of the 2002/2003 issues from Sunspots sound amazing.</p><p>At the same time, that tape research led to a massive amount of confusion -- evidently, in order to drive up fees from Columbia in America and other 1960s licensees, Immediate issued undubbed backing tracks and unfinished outtakes with newly attached titles; even the surviving bandmembers were confused by some of these titles and tracks, though as of 2003 they were helping to sort out their real legacy, including a set of live television appearances released by NMC. Additionally, thanks to deals negotiated with the successor labels to Decca and Immediate, with the release of Sanctuary Records' Ultimate Collection in 2003, the members and their estates were collecting full royalties for the very first time.</p>&mdash; <b>Bruce Eder</b>",

The Small Faces had already shown a surprising adaptability to psychedelia with the single ~Itchycoo Park~ and much of their other 1967 output, but Ogden's Nut Gone Flake pretty much ripped the envelope. British bands had an unusual approach to psychedelia from the get-go, often preferring to assume different musical ~personae~ on their albums, either feigning actual ~roles~ in the context of a variety show (as on the Beatles' Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album), or simply as storytellers in the manner of the Pretty Things on S.F. Sorrow, or actor/performers as on the Who's Tommy. The Small Faces tried a little bit of all of these approaches on Ogden's Nut Gone Flake, but they never softened their sound. Side one's material, in particular, would not have been out of place on any other Small Faces release -- ~Afterglow (Of Your Love)~ and ~Rene~ both have a pounding beat from Kenny Jones, and Ian McLagan's surging organ drives the former while his economical piano accompaniment embellishes the latter; and Steve Marriott's crunching guitar highlights ~Song of a Baker.~ Marriott singing has him assuming two distinct ~roles,~ neither unfamiliar -- the Cockney upstart on ~Rene~ and ~Lazy Sunday,~ and the diminutive soul-shouter on ~Afterglow (of Your Love)~ and ~Song of a Baker.~ Some of side two's production is more elaborate, with overdubbed harps and light orchestration here and there, and an array of more ambitious songs, all linked by a narration by comic dialect expert Stanley Unwin, about a character called ~Happiness Stan.~ The core of the sound, however, is found in the pounding ~Rollin' Over,~ which became a highlight of the group's stage act during its final days -- the song seems lean and mean with a mix in which Ronnie Lane's bass is louder than the overdubbed horns. Even ~Mad John,~ which derives from folk influences, has a refreshingly muscular sound on its acoustic instruments. Overall, this was the ballsiest-sounding piece of full-length psychedelia to come out of England, and it rode the number one spot on the U.K. charts for six weeks in 1968, though not without some controversy surrounding advertisements by Immediate Records that parodied the Lord's Prayer. Still, Ogdens was the group's crowning achievement -- it had even been Marriott's hope to do a stage presentation of Ogden's Nut Gone Flake, though a television special might've been more in order. As with most Immediate Records releases, it has gone through multiple reissue cycles on vinyl and CD; the original LP came in a circular sleeve in keeping with the design of the cover, and was reissued in a more convention jacket during the 1970s and early '80s. Most of the CD versions until the 1990s were, in keeping with the poor state of the Immediate Records tape library, substandard in sound, but since 1994 or so there has been a succession of good-sounding digital remasterings.</p>&mdash; <b>Bruce Eder</b>"

		"lastname": "Smashing Pumpkins",
		"name": "The Smashing Pumpkins",
		"biography": "<p>Of all the major alternative rock bands of the early '90s, the Smashing Pumpkins were the group least influenced by traditional underground rock. Lead guitarist/songwriter Billy Corgan fashioned an amalgam of progressive rock, heavy metal, goth rock, psychedelia, and dream pop, creating a layered, powerful sound driven by swirling, distorted guitars. Corgan was wise enough to exploit his angst-ridden lyrics, yet he never shied away from rock star posturing, even if he did cloak it in allegedly ironic gestures. In fact, the Smashing Pumpkins became the model for alternative rock success -- Nirvana was too destructive and Pearl Jam shunned success. The Pumpkins, on the other hand, knew how to play the game, signing to a major-subsidized indie for underground credibility and moving to the major in time to make the group a multi-platinum act. And when the group did achieve mass success with 1993's Siamese Dream, they went a long way to legitimize heavy metal and orchestrated prog rock, helping move alternative rock even closer to '70s AOR, especially in the eyes of radio programmers and mainstream audiences. Unlike many of their contemporaries, the Pumpkins were able to withstand many internal problems and keep selling records, emerging as the longest-lasting and most successful alternative band of the early '90s.</p><p>The son of a jazz guitarist, Billy Corgan grew up in a Chicago suburb, leaving home at the age of 19 to move to Florida with his fledgling goth metal band, the Marked. After the band failed down South, he returned to Chicago around 1988, where he began working at a used-record store. At the shop he met James Iha (guitar), a graphic arts student at Loyola University, and the two began collaborating, performing and recording songs with a drum machine. Corgan met D'Arcy Wretzky at a club show; after arguing about the merits of the Dan Reed Network, the two became friends and she joined the group as a bassist. Soon, the band, who named themselves the Smashing Pumpkins, had gained a dedicated local following, including the head of a local club who booked them to open for Jane's Addiction. Before the pivotal concert, the band hired Jimmy Chamberlin, a former jazz musician, as their full-time drummer.</p><p>In 1990, the Smashing Pumpkins released their debut single, ~I Am One,~ on the local Chicago label Limited Potential. The single quickly sold out, and in December, the band released ~Tristessa~ on Sub Pop. By this point, the Smashing Pumpkins had become the subject of a hot bidding war, and the group latched on to a clever way to move to a major label without losing indie credibility. They signed to Virgin Records, yet it was decided that the group's debut would be released on the Virgin subsidiary Caroline, then the band would move to the majors. The strategy worked; Gish, a majestic mix of Black Sabbath and dream pop produced by Butch Vig, became a huge college and modern rock hit upon its spring 1991 release. While it earned a large audience, many indie rock fans began to snipe at the Smashing Pumpkins, accusing them of being careerists. Such criticism did the band no harm and they embarked on an extensive supporting tour for Gish, which lasted over a year and included opening slots for Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam. During the Gish tour, tensions between bandmembers began to escalate, as Iha and D'Arcy, who had been lovers, went through a messy breakup, Chamberlin became addicted to drugs and alcohol, and Corgan entered a heavy depression. These tensions hadn't been resolved by the time the group entered the studio with Vig to record their second album.</p><p>Toward the beginning of the sessions, the Pumpkins were given significant exposure through the inclusion of ~Drown~ on the Singles soundtrack in the summer of 1992. As the sessions progressed, Corgan relieved himself of his depression by working heavily -- not only did he write a surplus of songs, he played nearly all of the guitars and bass on each recording, which meant that its release was delayed several times. The resulting album, <i>Siamese Dream</i>, was an immaculate production owing much to Queen, yet it was embraced by critics upon its July 1993 release. <i>Siamese Dream</i> became a blockbuster, debuting at number ten on the charts and establishing the group as stars. ~Cherub Rock,~ the first single, was a modern rock hit, yet it was ~Today~ and the acoustic ~Disarm~ that sent the album into the stratosphere, as well as the group's relentless touring. The Smashing Pumpkins became the headliners of Lollapalooza 1994, and following the tour's completion, the band went back into the studio to record a new album that Corgan had already claimed would be a double-disc set. To tide fans over until the new album, the Pumpkins released the B-sides and rarities album <i>Pisces Iscariot</i> in October of 1994.</p><p>Working with producers Flood and Alan Moulder, the Smashing Pumpkins recorded as a full band for their third album, which turned out to be, as Corgan predicted, a double-disc set called <i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</i>. Although many observers were skeptical about whether a double-disc set, especially one so ridiculously named, would be a commercial success, Mellon Collie became an even bigger hit than <i>Siamese Dream</i>, debuting at number one on the charts. On the strength of the singles ~Bullet With Butterfly Wings,~ ~1979,~ ~Zero,~ and ~Tonight, Tonight,~ it would sell over four million copies in the U.S., eventually being certified platinum over eight times (each disc in the set counted separately toward certification). The Pumpkins had graduated to stadium shows for the Mellon Collie tour, and the band was at the peak of their popularity when things began to go wrong again. On July 12, prior to two shows at Madison Square Garden, the group's touring keyboardist, Jonathan Melvoin, died from a heroin overdose; he was with Jimmy Chamberlin, who survived his overdose. In the wake of the tragedy, the remaining Pumpkins fired Chamberlin and spent two months on hiatus as they recovered and searched for a new drummer. Early in August, they announced that Filter member Matt Walker would be their touring drummer, and Dennis Flemion, a member of the Frogs, would be their touring keyboardist for the remainder of the year. They returned to the stage at the end of August and spent the next five months on tour. During this time, Corgan contributed some music to Ron Howard's Ransom.</p><p>Early in 1997, once the Pumpkins left the road, Iha and D'Arcy launched Scratchie Records, a subsidiary of Mercury Records. In the spring, the Smashing Pumpkins recorded two songs for the soundtrack for Batman & Robin. Iha's solo debut, Let It Come Down, appeared in early 1998; <i>Adore</i>, the new Smashing Pumpkins LP, followed a few months later to disappointing sales and reviews. Chamberlin returned to the group and D'Arcy exited prior to the early-2000 release of <i>MACHINA: The Machines of God</i>. Several months later, Corgan announced his intentions to dissolve the band before the year was out. With former Hole bassist Melissa Auf Der Maur replacing D'Arcy, the band launched their farewell tour in 2000. Fans of the band received one last treat when Corgan and company worked feverishly to finish off tracks that were left over from the MACHINA sessions. Surprisingly, Virgin Records balked at the idea of releasing the 25-track set so close in time to their previous album, so the band put the entire album (going by the official title of Machina II: The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music) on the Internet for fans to download for free. On December 2 of the same year, the Pumpkins played a mammoth final show at Chicago's Metro (also the venue at which the group played their first show back in 1988), before officially calling it quits. But the former members of the band didn't wait long before carrying on with other projects -- Corgan spent the summer of 2001 playing guitar with New Order on select concert dates, and later in the year, unveiled his new band, Zwan, including Chamberlin on drums (as well as former Chavez guitarist Matt Sweeney and bassist Skullfisher). The other two former Pumpkins, Iha and Auf Der Maur, began putting together an alt-rock supergroup dubbed the Virgins, which may include such big names as Ryan Adams, former-Lemonhead Evan Dando, and former-D Generation leader Jesse Malin. The same year, a pair of postmortem Pumpkins collections were issued for the holiday season -- a double-disc collection and a DVD both called <i>Greatest Hits</i></p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine & Greg Prato</b>",

Singer/guitarist/leader Billy Corgan was battling a severe case of writer's block and was in a deep state of depression brought on by a relationship in turmoil; drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was addicted to hard drugs; and bassist D'Arcy and guitarist James Iha severed their romantic relationship. The sessions for their sophomore effort, <i>Siamese Dream</i>, were wrought with friction -- Corgan eventually played almost all the instruments himself (except for percussion). Some say strife and tension produces the best music, and it certainly helped make <i>Siamese Dream</i> one of the finest alt-rock albums of all time.</p> <p>Instead of following Nirvana's punk rock route, <i>Siamese Dream</i> went in the opposite direction -- guitar solos galore, layered walls of sound courtesy of the album's producers (Butch Vig and Corgan), extended compositions that bordered on prog rock, plus often reflective and heartfelt lyrics. The four tracks that were selected as singles became alternative radio standards -- the anthems ~Cherub Rock,~ ~Today,~ and ~Rocket,~ plus the symphonic ballad ~Disarm~ -- but as a whole, <i>Siamese Dream</i> proved to be an incredibly consistent album. Such compositions as the red-hot rockers ~Quiet~ and ~Geek U.S.A.~ were standouts, as were the epics ~Hummer,~ ~Soma,~ and ~Silverfuck,~ plus the soothing sounds of ~Mayonaise,~ ~Spaceboy,~ and ~Luna.~ After the difficult recording sessions, Corgan stated publicly that if <i>Siamese Dream</i> didn't achieve breakthrough success, he would end the band. He didn't have to worry for long -- the album debuted in the Billboard Top Ten and sold more than four million copies in three years. <i>Siamese Dream</i> stands alongside Nevermind and Superunknown as one of the decade's finest (and most influential) rock albums.</p>&mdash; <b>Greg Prato</b>"

		"biography": "&mdash;<b>Jason Ankeny</b><p>Folk-punk singer/songwriter Elliott Smith rose from indie obscurity to mainstream success in 1997 on the strength of ~Miss Misery,~ his Academy Award-nominated song from the film Good Will Hunting. A native of Portland, OR, Smith began writing and recording his first songs at age 14, later becoming a fixture of the city's thriving music scene; as a member of the band Heatmiser, he debuted in 1993 with the LP Dead Air, issuing his first solo effort Roman Candle on the tiny Cavity Search label a year later. For his 1995 self-titled album, Smith signed with the noted Kill Rock Stars label; Either/Or followed in 1997, around the same time that filmmaker and longtime fan Gus Van Sant requested permission to use the singer's music in his upcoming Good Will Hunting. Smith also composed a handful of new songs for the soundtrack, among them ~Miss Misery,~ and when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced its Oscar nominations the following February, the track was a surprise entry in the Best Original Song category. Although he did not win, Smith performed the song live at the televised Oscar broadcast, appearing on-stage alongside superstars Trisha Yearwood and eventual award-winner Celine Dion in one of the most notably surreal musical moments in recent memory. Smith's DreamWorks label debut, XO, followed later in 1998. Two years later he delivered Figure 8, which indulged in lush arrangements and orchestrations more so than any of his previous solo efforts. For the next two years, Smith labored over what was to be his next album, From a Basement on a Hill. He would not live to see its completion, however -- to the shock of friends and fans alike, Smith took his own life on October 21, 2003. The record was released two days shy of the first anniversary of his death.</p> ",

				"review": "<p>A year before his major-label debut, XO, was released, it seemed unlikely that Elliott Smith would even be on a major, let alone having his record be one of the more anticipated releases of 1998. He had certainly earned a great deal of critical respect with his low-key, acoustic indie records and was emerging as a respected songwriter, but he hadn't made much of an impression outside of journalists, record collectors, and indie rockers. An Oscar nomination can change things, however. ~Miss Misery,~ one of Smith's elegantly elegiac songs for Gus Van Sant's Good Will Hunting, unexpectedly earned an Academy Award nomination, and he was immediately thrust into the spotlight. He was reluctant to embrace instant celebrity, yet he didn't refuse a contract with DreamWorks, and he didn't shy away from turning XO into a glorious fruition of his talents. Smith's songs remain intensely introspective, yet the lush, Beatlesque production provides a terrifically charming counterpoint. His sweetly dark melodies are vividly brought to life with the detailed arrangements, and they sell Smith's tormented songs -- it's easy to get caught up in the tunes and the sound of the record, then realize later what the songs are actually about. That's a sign of a good craftsman, and XO proves that not only can Elliott Smith craft a song, but he knows how to make an alluring pop record as well.</p>&mdash;<b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"biography": "<p>This innovative underground band formed in 1969 in Melbourne. Instrumentally, they have been likened to early Soft Machine or Egg. Musically, they played long instrumental passages with unusual lyrics and light shows. Some of their songs were finely structured whilst others were heavier and very unpredictable.</p><p>As music of this type had very limited commercial appeal, they played dance music, too, under another name, The Murtceps.</p><p>Still, they enjoyed a No. 4 hit with I'll Be Gone during a twenty-five week stay in 1971. A much compiled track you'll also find it on Australian Rock Classics, Go Set Pop Poll Awards 1970 (along with Going Home), Molly's Australian Evolution, Sunbury '72, together with Some Good Advice), Trax Australian Made II and Nat Young's History Of Australian Surfing. Their albums sold well too, Spectrum Part 1 narrowly missed the Top 20, something which Milesago rectified towards the end of 1971.</p><p>The hit single version of I'll Be Gone was an unedited mono cut of the original full length master, which only appeared in original form on the Go-Set Pop Polls Awards 1971 album at the time. It was later included on the Spectrum compilation Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet and then on Raven's 1992 CD compilation Ghosts: Post Terminal Reflection. Both I'll Be Gone and its flip side were covered by Manfred Mann's Earthband.</p><p>Spectrum Part One is a quintessential Aussie progressive rock item. Described by Ian McFarlane in 'Freedom Train' as a tremendous guitar/organ-driven, prog/psych classic, it's notable for the druggy Make Your Stash whose chorus was based around the beautiful Jupiter movement of Holst's Planets Suite; the Pink Floyd-inspired FiddlingFool and the beautiful Superbody.</p><p>For the follow-up 45 they released an edited version of Trust Me. The song was written by new drummer Ray Arnott and had been performed by his earlier band Company Caine. The flip contained an instrumental Going Home. Too complex for the singles market it sold poorly as did the follow-up But That's Alright, despite being a much catchier number.</p><p>1971 was also the year Spectrum developed an alter-ego, Indelible Murtceps with the same personnel Mike Rudd launched a money-making assault on the dance/disco circuit, leaving Spectrum to concentrate on a more esoteric sound.</p><p>Milesago was an ambitious double album, which was musically very diverse but, as is often the case with double albums, failed to maintain a consistent standard throughout. The title track was an ambitious avant-garde number; Fly Without Its Wings had lots of atmosphere and both contrast greatly with acoustic tracks like Tell Me Why andfaster numbers like But That's Alright and The Virgin's Tale.</p><p>December 1973 saw the release of the double live album Terminal Buzz. The material was taken from the band's farewell live concert on 15th April 1973 and spanned their whole career. Earlier in the year they contributed, as one would expect, the spacey, more esoteric material to Testimonial, which was credited to Spectrum / Indelible Murtceps. Their cuts included It Would Be Nice, Homesick Valium Blues, Who Is Bugging You? and Essay In Paranoia.</p><p>Mike Rudd's next venture was with Ariel.</p>",

There was an attempt to keep a demarcation between the two though, each track being assigned to one name or the other, with clear instrumentation and genre differences. Instead of this diversity being a strength, as it was on Milesago, it becomes jarring. The Murtceps numbers are generally straight-forward boogie numbers (with apparently an ear to the success of Daddy Cool - the guitar riff in ~Indelible Shuffle~ is very reminiscent of their ~Hi Honey Ho~), with keyboards restricted to piano. The Spectrum numbers are ponderous mid-tempo numbers with a fuller range of keyboard sounds (courtesy new member John Mills), including the first use of synthesizers, but little of the fire we used to get from Lee Neale - or from anyone else in the band. The best number on the album is the one Murtceps number to break the genre straightjacket imposed on each identity, ~Real Meanie~. The best of the Spectrum numbers are ~I Think I Even Missed The Station~ and Ray Arnott's grooving ~It Would Be Nice~. ~Essay In Paranoia~, apparently a stage favourite at the time, is the most overtly proggy in it's multiple sections and use of synthesizer.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Simon - Progarchives.com</strong></p>"

		"lastname": "Split Enz",
		"name": "Split Enz",
		"biography": "<P>Best known for their early-'80s new wave pop hits, particularly ~I Got You,~ Split Enz -- after surviving a dizzying array of image and personnel changes and a full decade without any recognition outside of their homeland -- became the first New Zealand band to achieve worldwide success. Although they never reached superstar status outside of Australia and New Zealand, the band developed a strong international cult following that continued to thrive over a decade after their breakup. Split Enz's output always seemed slightly outside of the times and often frustratingly obscure, but in the end, they left behind a body of work that was always interesting and often reached pure pop brilliance. <P>The group was founded in 1972 in Auckland, New Zealand, by Brian Timothy Finn and Phil Judd. Initially, the band was a light acoustic combo called Split Ends consisting of Judd (guitar, vocals), Finn (vocals, piano), Miles Golding (violin), Mike Howard (flute), and Mike Chunn (bass). Finn and Judd were the main songwriting force of the band's early years. Judd drew his inspiration from a wild variety of often non-musical sources while Finn's tastes leaned toward the British pop of the Beatles, the Kinks, and the Move. In a creative rush that lasted several months, the two bashed out songs on acoustic guitars -- Judd working out the basic song with lyrics and Finn providing the melodies. Miles Golding came from a classical background and pushed the band into complex, neo-classical structures and arrangements. The result was an eclectic mix of styles that was quite original though not very commercial. After months of rehearsals, the group went into the studio to record their first single, ~For You~/~Split Ends,~ in February of 1973. After the single was released, the band launched a small tour; upon its completion, Golding left the group to study in London. At Chunn's urging, the band went for a new, electric sound, adding Geoff Chunn on drums, Wally Wilkinson on guitar, and saxophonist Rob Gillies, who was only a part-time member. After the new lineup was in place, Judd refused to tour, claiming their music was too complex for stage presentation; he stayed behind to write and record new material while the rest of the band toured, although he would later rejoin the live lineup. The group made an appearance on the televised New Zealand talent contest New Faces -- though they finished second to last, it gave them some crucial early exposure. In 1974, former Space Waltz keyboardist Tony (Eddie) Rayner was added to the band and they changed their name to Split Enz. Following the name change, the group embarked on a series of radio-sponsored ~Buck-a-Head~ shows -- rather than play the more traditional pub circuit, they played theaters, which seemed more suited to the band's style. The group's shows took on a theatrical tone, as the bandmembers wore wild, colorful costumes and sported a variety of odd hairdos. Finn acted as master of ceremonies, giving odd spoken soliloquies. Judd made the occasional appearances as did costume designer and spoons soloist Noel Crombie. By the fall of 1974, Crombie was added as a full-time member on percussion. Before the tour was completed, Geoff Chunn was replaced by Paul Crowther and Rob Gillies left the group.</p> <P>In March of 1975, the group traveled to Australia -- at this time, all members except Judd switched to using their middle names. Mistakenly billed as ~New Zealand's raunchiest rock &amp; roll band,~ the band struggled for nine months but they eventually earned a small cult following and secured a contract with Mushroom Records. Their debut album, Mental Notes, was recorded in two weeks. While their inexperience in the studio combined with an unsympathetic producer led to a less than satisfying result in the band's eyes, the album encapsulated the band at its artiest and most ambitious. The album made a brief appearance on both the Australian and New Zealand charts. By November of 1975 Wilkinson was fired and Gillies rejoined.</p><P>Split Enz had caught the attention of Roxy Music's Phil Manzanera, who offered to help the band with their next album; they arranged to meet him in England to redo Mental Notes. Before leaving, they recorded a new single, ~Late Last Night.~ Despite the complex song structure, the single showed the band moving toward a pop direction; nevertheless, it failed to have much impact. ~Late Last Night~ was accompanied by a video clip, which was an uncommon practice in 1976; the band would continue to make conceptual clips from that point on. In April of 1976, Split Enz joined up with Manzanera in England and signed to Chrysalis for worldwide distribution. While the recordings went well, they found it impossible to secure live work in Britain without an agent. The band rehearsed constantly, although the songwriting partnership of Judd and Finn had dried up and no new songs were being written. Second Thoughts, essentially a reworked Mental Notes, was released toward the end of 1976 (it was released internationally as Mental Notes). Before the band supported the album with a U.S. tour in early 1977, Crowther was replaced on drums by Mal Green. Judd, fed up with uninterested audiences and the demands of promotion, left the band during the tour and Chunn left two months later. The band returned to England to regroup -- they replaced Judd with Tim's younger brother Neil and recruited bassist Nigel Griggs.</p><P>Tim Finn assumed leadership of the new incarnation of Split Enz and the group began to move away from its arty, theatrical tendencies on their next LP, 1977's Dizrhythmia. In Australia, the album went gold and the single ~My Mistake~ became their first Top 20 hit. In England, the group fared far worse. In the wake of the punk explosion, Split Enz seemed slightly out of touch. Though their odd looks and new, leaner material wasn't so far removed from post-punk styles, their earlier reputation seemed more in line with the progressive rock the punks sought to destroy. However, they did manage to keep a small cult following within the U.K.</p><P>By early 1978, Split Enz had been dropped by Chrysalis and, unable to get gigs, they were forced to go on the dole. They continued writing new material at a feverish pace and rehearsing constantly. Gillies was fired and Judd rejoined but he found himself unable to fit into the new direction of the band and left the group shortly thereafter; he later found limited success as the leader of the Swingers and as a solo artist. The New Zealand Arts Council came to the band's aid with a 5,000-dollar grant. A studio in Luton was booked and the band knocked off 28 songs in under five days. These sessions, known as the ~Rootin' Tootin' Luton Tapes,~ displayed a newfound edge and considerable commercial potential. Around the same time, they recorded a new single with producer David Tickle -- a straight-ahead rocker called ~I See Red~ -- which charted respectably in Australia. Split Enz returned to Australia to make their next album, 1978's Frenzy, re-recording many songs from the Luton tapes. However, the final product paled in comparison to the demos -- the high energy of the original tapes simply wasn't captured and many of the best songs were left on the demos. Many of the Luton recordings would later resurface on the A&amp;M version of Frenzy, released in North America in 1981.</p><P>The band teamed up again with David Tickle for their next album, True Colours, in 1979. The album lacked the excesses of their previous albums and showcased their new pure pop direction. With Neil Finn's seductive ~I Got You,~ the band finally broke through -- the single and album hit number one in Australia and New Zealand, with the album eventually selling 200,000 albums in Australia, the equivalent of one in every ten homes in that country. The success led to an international deal with A&amp;M Records. True Colours performed well in the U.K. and the U.S. and went platinum in Canada. The band quickly recorded a follow-up during a mid-year break in touring. The result -- called Corroboree in Australia and Waiata internationally -- was released in April of 1981. The record was somewhat disappointing, seeming to follow the same formula as its predecessor but with decidedly lesser material. The album failed to match the success of True Colours, but it did manage two hit singles, ~One Step Ahead~ and ~History Never Repeats.~ On their subsequent North American tour, Split Enz were billed equally with Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, which stands as a testament to the band's growing popularity. Mal Green left the band to work on solo projects and Crombie took over on drums.</p><P>By late 1981, after many months of intensive touring, the band retreated to the studio to record their most personal and creatively satisfying album to date, Time and Tide. Released in 1982, it immediately topped the Australian and New Zealand charts. The advent of MTV and the channel's commitment to new wave acts helped the band's growing cult status in America -- both ~Dirty Creature~ and ~Six Months in a Leaky Boat~ (as well as earlier videos) saw heavy airplay on the channel -- but the album failed to see much chart action. <P>Early in 1983, Tim took a break from Split Enz to work on a solo album, Escapade. The album was a big success in Australasia, spawning several hits singles including the Top Ten ~Fraction Too Much Friction.~ For all of its success, though, the album distracted Tim, delaying the follow-up to Time and Tide and effectively ending the momentum Split Enz had built over the previous three albums. Conflicting Emotions was finally finished by the fall of 1983. Prior to this album, Tim had been the primary contributor, but for this effort, he was overshadowed by brother Neil who had written a considerable majority of songs for the first time. The album, while predictably successful in Australia/New Zealand, saw a delayed release in the States and failed to make much impact. A new drummer, Paul Hester, was added, demoting Crombie to percussion. Before work was begun on the next album, Tim announced that he was leaving the band. With Neil Finn as the leader, the band carried on for one more album -- 1984's See Ya Round, an uneven album that was released only in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Neil decided to fold the band following a farewell tour, Enz with a Bang!, for which Tim rejoined the group.</p><P>Neil and Paul Hester went on to form the internationally successful Crowded House, Tim continued a sporadic solo career, joining Crowded House for the Woodface album in 1991. Nigel Griggs, Noel Crombie, and Phil Judd formed Schnell Fenster, releasing two albums before disbanding and Eddie Rayner has done session work and formed his own combo, the Makers. Tim and Neil Finn reunited for a Finn Brothers album in 1995. Split Enz remains an institution in their homeland, occassionally playing reunion gigs. In 1996, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra performed a symphonic tribute to Split Enz under the direction of Eddie Rayner with contributions from both Tim and Neil Finn as well as other New Zealand artists including Dave Dobbyn. The resulting album, ENZSO, spent several weeks in the Australian and New Zealand Top Ten. A second ENZSO project, ENZSO 2, followed in 1999. The classic Enz lineup reunited for a New Year's Eve millennium gig in New Zealand. In 2005 the band was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and the True Colours-era lineup reunited again for a brief but highly successful Australian tour in 2006.</p><P>&nbsp;— <B>Chris Woodstra</B></P>",

There are no shortage of Enz collections on the market, and this is the best to date. All of the tracks have been remastered, and as an incentive to collectors, the rare Luton version of ~Semi-Detached~ and a drastically remixed version of ~Stuff and Nonsense~ have been added. The one major flaw is the non-chronological sequencing, which, for a band with two distinct phases and a clear career arc, misses the opportunity to tell the band's story completely. Minor complaints aside, Spellbound is a good starting point for those who want more than any of the single-disc collections have to offer.

		"name": "Bruce Springsteen",
		"biography": "<p>In the decades following his emergence on the national scene in 1975, Bruce Springsteen proved to be that rarity among popular musicians: an artist who maintained his status as a frontline recording and performing star, consistently selling millions of albums and selling out arenas and stadiums around the world year after year, as well as retaining widespread critical approbation with ecstatic reviews greeting those discs and shows. Although there have been a few speed bumps along the way in Springsteen's career, the wonder of his nearly unbroken string of critical and commercial successes is that he achieved it while periodically challenging his listeners by going off in unexpected directions, following his muse even when that meant altering the sound of his music or the composition of his backup band, or making his lyrical message overtly political. Of course, it may have been these very sidesteps that kept his image and his music fresh, especially since he always had the fallback of returning to what his fans thought he did best, barnstorming the country with a marathon rock & roll show using his longtime bandmates.<p><p>Bruce Springsteen was born September 23, 1949 in Freehold, New Jersey, the son of Douglas Springsteen, a bus driver, and Adele (Zirilli) Springsteen, a secretary. He became interested in music after seeing Elvis Presley perform on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956 and got a guitar, but he didn't start playing seriously until 1963. In 1965, he joined his first band, the Beatles-influenced Castiles. They got as far as playing in New York City, but broke up in 1967 around the time Springsteen graduated from high school and began frequenting clubs in Asbury Park, New Jersey. From there, he briefly joined Earth, a hard rock band in the style of Cream. Also in the hard rock vein was his next group, Child (soon renamed Steel Mill), which featured keyboard player Danny Federici and drummer Vini Lopez. (Later on, guitarist Steve Van Zandt joined on bass.) Steel Mill played in California in 1969, drawing a rave review in San Francisco and even a contract offer from a record label. But they broke up in 1971, and Springsteen formed a big band, the short-lived Dr. Zoom & the Cosmic Boom, quickly superseded by the Bruce Springsteen Band. Along with Federici, Lopez, and Van Zandt (who switched back to guitar), this group also included pianist David Sancious and bassist Garry Tallent, plus a horn section that didn't last long before being replaced by a single saxophonist, Clarence Clemons. Due to a lack of work, however, Springsteen broke up the band and began playing solo shows in New York City. It was as a solo performer that he acquired a manager, Mike Appel, who arranged an audition for legendary Columbia talent scout John Hammond. Hammond signed Springsteen to Columbia in 1972.<p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/0004412865.jpg~ alt=~Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.~><p>In preparing his debut LP, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., Springsteen immediately rehired most of his backup band, Federici, Lopez, Sancious, Tallent, and Clemons. (Van Zandt, on tour with the Dovells, was mostly unavailable.) The album went unnoticed upon its initial release in January 1973 (although Manfred Mann's Earth Band would turn its lead-off track, ~Blinded by the Light,~ into a number one hit four years later, and the LP itself has since gone double platinum). The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle (September 1973) also failed to sell despite some rave reviews. (It too has gone double platinum.) The following year, Springsteen revised his backup group -- now dubbed the E Street Band -- as Lopez and Sancious left, and Max Weinberg (drums) and Roy Bittan (piano) joined, and in 1975, Van Zandt returned to the group. With this unit he toured extensively while working on the LP that represented his last chance with Columbia. By the time Born to Run (August 1975) was released, the critics and a significant cult audience were with him, and the title song became a Top 40 hit while the album reached the Top Ten, going on to sell six million copies.<p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/0004412842.jpg~ alt=~Darkness on the Edge of Town~><p>Despite this breakthrough, Springsteen's momentum was broken by a legal dispute, as he split from Appel and brought in Jon Landau (a rock critic who had famously called him the ~rock & roll future~ in a 1974 concert review) as his new manager. The legal issues weren't resolved until 1977, during which time Springsteen was unable to record. (One beneficiary of this problem was Patti Smith, to whom Springsteen gave the composition ~Because the Night,~ which, with some lyrical revisions by her, became her only Top 40 hit in the spring of 1978.) He finally returned in June 1978 with Darkness on the Edge of Town. By then, he had to rebuild his career. Record labels had recruited their own versions of the Springsteen ~heartland rock~ sound, in such similar artists as Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band (who actually preceded Springsteen but achieved national recognition in his wake), Johnny Cougar (aka John Mellencamp), Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Meat Loaf, Eddie Money, and even fellow Jersey Shore residents Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes, to name only some of the more successful ones. At the same time, the punk/new wave trend had become the new focus of critical devotion, making Springsteen seem unfashionable. Notwithstanding these challenges, Darkness earned its share of good reviews and achieved Top Ten status, selling three million copies as the single ~Prove It All Night~ hit the Top 40. (In early 1979, the Pointer Sisters took Springsteen's composition ~Fire~ into the Top Ten.)<p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/0001047882.jpg~ alt=~Nebraska~><p>Springsteen fully consolidated his status with his next album, the two-LP set The River (October 1980), which hit number one, sold five million copies, and spawned the Top Ten hit ~Hungry Heart~ and the Top 40 hit ~Fade Away.~ (In 1981-1982, Gary U.S. Bonds reached the Top 40 with two Springsteen compositions, ~This Little Girl~ and ~Out of Work.~) But having finally topped the charts, Springsteen experimented on his next album, preferring the demo recordings of the songs he had made for Nebraska (September 1982) to full-band studio versions, especially given the dark subject matter of his lyrics. The stark LP nevertheless hit the Top Ten and sold a million copies without benefit of a hit single or a promotional tour. (Van Zandt amicably left the E Street Band for a solo career at this point and was replaced by Nils Lofgren.)<p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/0000286689.jpg~ alt=~Born in the U.S.A.~><p>But then came Born in the U.S.A. (June 1984) and a two-year international tour. The album hit number one, threw off seven Top Ten hits (~Dancing in the Dark,~ which earned Springsteen his first Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, ~Cover Me,~ ~Born in the U.S.A.,~ ~I'm on Fire,~ ~Glory Days,~ ~I'm Goin' Down,~ and ~My Hometown~), and sold 15 million copies, putting Springsteen in the pop heavens with Michael Jackson and Prince. For his next album, he finally exploited his reputation as a live performer by releasing the five-LP/three-CD box set Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band Live/1975-85 (November 1986), which topped the charts, was certified platinum 13 times, and spawned a Top Ten hit in a cover of Edwin Starr's ~War.~ (In March 1987, ~the Barbusters~ -- actually Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, took Springsteen's composition ~Light of Day,~ written for the movie of the same name, into the Top 40.)<p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/0000869537.jpg~ alt=~Tunnel of Love~><p>Characteristically, Springsteen returned to studio work with a more introverted effort, Tunnel of Love (October 1987), which presaged his 1989 divorce from his first wife, actress Julianne Phillips. (He married a second time, to singer/songwriter/guitarist Patti Scialfa, who had joined the E Street Band as a backup vocalist in 1984.) The album was another number one hit, selling three million copies and producing two Top Ten singles, ~Brilliant Disguise~ and the title song, as well as the Top 40 hit ~One Step Up.~ The album earned him a second male rock vocal Grammy. (In the spring of 1988, Natalie Cole covered the Springsteen B-side ~Pink Cadillac~ for a Top Ten hit.)<p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/0000115823.jpg~ alt=~Human Touch~><p>Springsteen retreated from public view in the late '80s, breaking up the E Street Band in November 1989. He returned to action in March 1992 with a new backup band, simultaneously releasing two albums, Human Touch and Lucky Town, which entered the charts at numbers two and three, respectively, each going platinum. A double-sided single combining ~Human Touch~ and ~Better Days~ was a Top 40 hit. Of course, this was a relative fall-off from the commercial heights of the mid-'80s, but Springsteen was undeterred. He next contributed the moody ballad ~Streets of Philadelphia~ to the soundtrack of Philadelphia, film director Jonathan Demme's 1993 depiction of a lawyer fighting an unjust termination for AIDS. The recording became a Top Ten hit, and the song went on to win Springsteen four Grammys (Song of the Year, Best Rock Song, best song written for a motion picture or television, and another for male rock vocal) and the Academy Award for best song.<p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/0000850205.jpg~ alt=~Greatest Hits~><p>In early 1995, Springsteen reconvened the E Street Band to record a few new tracks for his Greatest Hits (February 1995). The album topped the charts and sold four million copies, with one of the new songs, ~Secret Garden,~ eventually reaching the Top 40. Despite this success, Springsteen resisted the temptation to reunite with the E Street Band on an ongoing basis at this point, instead recording another low-key, downcast, near-acoustic effort in the style of Nebraska, The Ghost of Tom Joad (November 1995), and embarking on a solo tour to promote it. The LP won a Grammy for best contemporary folk album, but it missed the Top Ten and only went gold.<p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/0000736147.jpg~ alt=~Tracks~><p>A much more prolific songwriter and recording artist than what was reflected in his legitimately released discography, Springsteen went into his vault of unreleased material and assembled the four-CD box set Tracks (November 1998), which went platinum. Whether inspired by the playing he heard on those recordings, bowing to constant fan pressure, or simply recognizing the musicians with whom he had made his most successful music, Springsteen finally reunited the E Street Band in 1999, beginning with a performance at his induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. All the members from the 1974-1989 edition of the group returned. (Characteristically, Springsteen sidestepped the question of whether to use Van Zandt or Lofgren in the guitar position by rehiring both of them.) They embarked on a world tour that lasted until mid-2000, its final dates resulting in the album Live in New York City, which hit the Top Ten and sold a million copies.<p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/0000833821.jpg~ alt=~The Rising~><p>Springsteen's writing process in coming up with a new rock album to be recorded with members of the E Street Band was given greater impetus in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the resulting disc, The Rising (July 2002), contained songs that reflected on the tragedy. The album hit number one and sold two million copies, winning the Grammy for rock album, and the title song won for rock song and male rock vocal. Following another lengthy tour with the E Street Band, Springsteen again returned to the style and mood of Nebraska on another solo recording, Devils & Dust (April 2005), taking to the road alone to promote it. The album hit number one and went gold, winning a Grammy for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. One year later, Springsteen unveiled another new musical approach when he presented We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions (April 2006), an album on which he played new arrangements of folk songs associated with Pete Seeger, played by a specially assembled Sessions Band. The album reached the Top Ten and went gold as Springsteen toured with the group. It also won the Grammy for Best Traditional Folk Album. The tour led to a concert recording, Live in Dublin (June 2007), which reached the Top 40.<p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/0001336269.jpg~ alt=~Magic~><p>Once again, Springsteen recorded a new rock album, Magic (October 2007), as a precursor to re-forming the E Street Band and going out on another long tour. The album hit number one and went platinum, with the song ~Radio Nowhere~ earning Grammys for rock song and solo rock vocal. (Another track from the album, ~Girls in Their Summer Clothes,~ won the rock song Grammy the following year.) Sadly, longtime E Street Band keyboardist Danny Federici succumbed to a three-year battle with melanoma on April 17, 2008, his death causing the first irrevocable change in the group's personnel (saxophonist Clarence Clemons would die on June 18, 2011 due to complications from a stroke). Federici was replaced by Charles Giordano, who had played with Springsteen previously in the Sessions Band.<p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/0001013919.jpg~ alt=~Working on a Dream~><p>Springsteen finished the tour in 2008 and held several additional shows in support of Senator Barack Obama, whose presidential campaign had kicked into hyperdrive earlier that year. While playing an Obama rally in early November, Springsteen debuted material from his forthcoming album, Working on a Dream, whose tracks had been recorded with the E Street Band during breaks in the group's previous tour. The resulting album, which was the last to feature contributions from Federici (as well as his son, Jason), arrived on January 27, 2009, one week after Obama's historic inauguration. It immediately hit number one, Springsteen's ninth album to top the charts over a period of three decades, and it went on to go gold and win him another Grammy for solo rock vocal. In February, Springsteen and the E Street Band provided the half-time entertainment at Super Bowl XLIII. The group's tour, which featured full-length performances of some of Springsteen's classic albums at selected shows, ran through November 22, 2009. In December, the 60-year-old was ranked fourth among the top touring acts of the first decade of the 21st century, behind only the Rolling Stones, U2, and Madonna. The same month he was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors.<p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/0003566480.jpg~ alt=~Wrecking Ball~><p>Springsteen's 2010 was devoted to a revival of Darkness on the Edge of Town, with the 1978 masterpiece receiving an expanded box set called The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town; the set contained a feature-length documentary and a double-disc set of outtakes that was also available separately. As Springsteen began work on a studio album produced by Ron Aniello, who'd previously worked with Patti Scialfa, Clarence Clemons died. Clemons' last recorded solo appeared on ~Land of Hope and Dreams,~ one of many politically charged songs on the resulting album, Wrecking Ball. Supported by a major media blitz that included a showcase week of Springsteen covers on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and the Boss delivering a keynote address at South by Southwest, Wrecking Ball appeared the first week of March 2012. Before the end of that month, he embarked on a mammoth world tour to promote the album, on which he eventually took in 26 countries over the course of 18 months.<p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/0004284458.jpg~ alt=~High Hopes~><p>Late in 2013, it was announced that the E Street Band would receive a belated induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in early 2014. Prior to the induction ceremony came High Hopes, Springsteen's 18th studio album. Inspired in part by Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who had temporarily replaced Van Zandt for the last six months of the Wrecking Ball tour and also played on the album, High Hopes was a collection of covers, reinterpretations of old songs, and leftovers; it appeared in mid-January 2014 and easily reached number one on the album charts. He toured with the E Street Band through the late spring, and also issued the EP American Beauty, which consisted of four unreleased songs from the High Hopes sessions.<p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/0004597564.jpg~ alt=~Chapter & Verse~><p>In late 2015, Springsteen released another audio/video box set offering an in-depth look at one of his classic albums. The Ties That Bind: The River Collection offered a remastered version of Springsteen's 1980 album, along with an expansive disc of outtakes, an early single-LP version of the album Springsteen pulled prior to release, an original documentary on the making of The River, and a complete concert filmed in Tempe, Arizona, in 1980. In the fall of 2016, Springsteen released a memoir entitled Born to Run, which was accompanied by a career-spanning collection called Chapter & Verse that he compiled himself.<p><p>Shortly after publishing his memoir, Springsteen adapted the book for the stage in the guise of the Broadway production Springsteen on Broadway. Opening in October 2017, the show ran until December 2018. Upon its conclusion, the production was captured as a film and a double-disc album; the record debuted at 11 on Billboard's Top 200.<p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/0005053270_002.jpg~ alt=~Western Stars~><p>In June 2019, Springsteen returned with his first studio album of original material in five years.

Springsteen's backup band had changed, with his two virtuoso players, keyboardist David Sancious and drummer Vini Lopez, replaced by the professional but less flashy Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg. The result was a full, highly produced sound that contained elements of Phil Spector's melodramatic work of the 1960s. Layers of guitar, layers of echo on the vocals, lots of keyboards, thunderous drums -- Born to Run had a big sound, and Springsteen wrote big songs to match it. The overall theme of the album was similar to that of The E Street Shuffle; Springsteen was describing, and saying farewell to, a romanticized teenage street life. But where he had been affectionate, even humorous before, he was becoming increasingly bitter. If Springsteen had celebrated his dead-end kids on his first album and viewed them nostalgically on his second, on his third he seemed to despise their failure, perhaps because he was beginning to fear he was trapped himself. Nevertheless, he now felt removed, composing an updated West Side Story with spectacular music that owed more to Bernstein than to Berry. To call Born to Run overblown is to miss the point; Springsteen's precise intention is to blow things up, both in the sense of expanding them to gargantuan size and of exploding them. If The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle was an accidental miracle, Born to Run was an intentional masterpiece. It declared its own greatness with songs and a sound that lived up to Springsteen's promise, and though some thought it took itself too seriously, many found that exalting.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>s"

				"review": "<p>There is such a strange feeling to be writing this, listening intently to the remastered version of Bruce Springsteen's breakthrough 1975 recording Born to Run, as if it hadn't happened at all but was happening in this moment. To look back at pop history as something of an oracle through the glass on its reverse side is always tricky. There was a lot at stake in rock & roll in those days. David Bowie was about to move into his next incarnation after the death of Ziggy Stardust and into his Berlin period; Queen was moving away from hard rock and into its own identity as well; Roxy Music was about to crack it; the J. Geils Band was shattering houses everywhere with its brand of roots blues and barroom rock; T. Rex was almost absent on American shores, and Kiss had stepped in mightily and faultily to cash in on it all. Meanwhile, the Faces were history, and the New York Dolls were disintegrating; Aerosmith were fighting each other, Led Zep were the power and glory of hard rock; Iggy was lost to addiction; Marvin Gaye and Motown were turning into something else, as was the Philly soul sound, mutating into the next phase of funk, and eventually disco. P-Funk were tearing it up musically and on the road, but not to many white audiences; Marvin Gaye was working on I Want You; Leroy Hutson was releasing the best albums of his career but to little notice of rock audiences; Miles was in retirement, and only Grover Washington was carrying the soul-jazz banner into the future with Mister Magic and Feels So Good. The Rolling Stones were doing their thing, but they were the Rolling Stones. And then the dread Yes and Jethro Tull and Emerson, Lake & Palmer were ruining rock for another five years. The time was right for something to happen, and happen it did. Springsteen and his E Street Band, armed with a slew of session players, came ambling out of the New Jersey shadows, having no idea what they were doing with a brand of guttersnipe, gritty rock infused with soul, R&B, garage band aesthetics, and a stage show that challenged even Mott the Hoople's, to conquer the world whether they wanted to or not.</p><p>In its present incarnation, finally remastered to full satisfaction of fans in the post-LP era, Born to Run sounds as startling, dynamic, and desperate as it did in 1975. The songs roar once more with all the drama of the young, where everything is at stake. Back porches, ramshackle motorcycles, the hidden intimacy of back streets, the violent danger of street gangs vying for turf, and the story of their life and death struggles told and retold with apocryphal detail from a group of observers to those who would retell and embellish them. There's the boredom of summer days and working nine to five just to break out into who knows what, and that desire -- the one that covers everything -- the one that knows that just beyond the confines of front yards and downtowns lies America, and some dream that would materialize if only one had the courage to run toward it. Springsteen's voice is full, raging, howling, crooning, and above all simply full of the magic of his own words as given life by a band who knows nothing except for putting it all on the line. In its present incarnation Born to Run once again proves its place among the greatest rock & roll albums ever recorded. This is it -- life, death, love, betrayal, and the dynamics of big-screen portrayals of the mysteries of everyday -- ordinary life boiled down to an explosive essence that carries within it everything rock & roll ever promised.</p><p>The bonus DVDs are something to behold as well. The Hammersmith Odeon concert from the tour that's included here has a set list to die for. It's adrenaline-filled and fear-drenched. These guys were scared and it fueled the gig. There's everything to prove, and the E Street Band had the quavering guts and naïveté to pull it off. These guys play their asses off; it's as if tomorrow they'll die so what the hell -- and given that the bile Brit music tabloids had the proven potential for, it was entirely possible, as Springsteen explains in his liner notes. The track list is simply incredible, from the cuts to the album at hand to those coming from Greetings from Asbury Park -- ~Lost in the Flood,~ ~Hard to Be a Saint in the City,~ ~For You,~ -- to those from The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle -- ~Fourth of July Asbury Park (Sandy),~ ~Kitty's Back,~ ~Rosalita.~ And as if this weren't enough, there is the classic ~Detroit Medley~ and ~Quarter to Three.~ This is a mind-blowing gig, filmed for preservation and forgotten about, until it was recently resurrected from Springsteen's own archives and mixed for this presentation by Bob Clearmountain.</p><p>As if all this weren't enough, there is another disc , Wings for Wheels, a kind of hodgepodge documentary on the making of the album with rare film footage from between 1973 and '75, concert footage, and the intimacy of the studio as this band struggled to keep their deal with the label -- they were on the verge of being booted into eternal obscurity as has-beens who couldn't deliver the big one. The fascination as Springsteen edits and works with Jon Landau to build the crazy, roaring Wall of Sound that became the single ~Born to Run~ is almost harrowing to watch -- not just as history, but as a gamble that paid off. This is as close to a fan's dream come true as it's going to get. But more than that, the package is the one that proves the reason for Springsteen's longevity. His faith and doubt, his willingness to go the distance, and his belief in the music itself as the conveyor of something bigger than himself to get the poetry across is awe-inspiring. Presented in this way, Born to Run is enough to make one accept that rock & roll is a force to be reckoned with rather than something to market cars, beer, and lingerie; it contains the mythic power of the ages, and dare it be said the proof that God himself can speak through a sleazy looking, beat, flesh and blood batch of street urchins using the ordinary as a means of speaking of the power, vulnerability, romance, and redemption of everyday life as something to be celebrated, struggled through, and cherished.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

				"review": "<p>Hammersmith Odeon, London '75 is the disc for those fans who didn't want to pony up the big money for the 30th anniversary edition of Born to Run and its two DVDs. This is the soundtrack for one of them, the Hammersmith Odeon concert, from beginning to end captured in vibrant sound. This show has been revered by tape traders and bootleggers for decades and never has it been presented better, thanks to Bob Clearmountain's fantastic mix. What makes this show so historically important is that it was the first time the band was able to travel overseas to play. (They were barred from doing so in the United States because of a legal battle with Springsteen's former manager.) In any case, well in advance of the gig the notorious British music weeklies began to create a pick-and-pan hype to build and topple a potential new rock messiah as they did all the time. Or, as Springsteen in his liner notes writes, ~...this week's Next...Big...Thing.~ The band was terrified yet geeked to play the hallowed hall. These guys were scared; it fueled the gig, and they pulled it off in spades. They have everything to prove, and plenty to stare down. (Hell, the media hype almost made them the standard-bearers for the entire history of American rock, whether they wanted to be or not — and they may not have believed it themselves, but they played like they felt the responsibility for it, overtly referencing Sam Cooke, Isaac Hayes, and even Boyce & Hart by including pieces of their tunes in Springsteen originals, showing where it all came from. And then, by using a portion of Celtic soulman Van Morrison's ~Moondance~ — who was taking his own bit from David ~Fathead~ Newman's read of his former boss Ray Charles — in ~Kitty's Back,~ they reveal clearly that the Beatles, the Stones, and the Who were nowhere to be found on this night.) Most of all, the E Street Band had the quivering guts and naïveté to pull it off. These guys play their asses off; it's as if tomorrow they'll die, so what the hell. The tape proves this show to be adrenaline-filled and fear-drenched. This is a mind-blowing gig. It was filmed for preservation and forgotten about until being resurrected by Springsteen.</p><p>The highlights? Hell, everything here. It begins with a tenderly desperate, under-orchestrated ~Thunder Road,~ sprints head on into a burning ~Tenth Avenue Freeze Out~ before whispering into a free jazz intro to a dramatic, swaggering ~Spirit in the Night~ that oozes street-smart Jersey soul. And the train never stops; it only slows a bit for moments at a time. And it's not for the band to catch its breath; it's for the crowd, whether it's the frighteningly intense ~Lost in the Flood,~ the shuffling country roots rock that introduces the rollicking ~She's the One,~ or the swaggering anthem of ~Born to Run,~ which only take listeners through a little over half of the first disc! They had the audience after ~Spirit,~ but they were into something deeper, wilder — check the spit and vinegar in ~It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City~ — so they kept pushing harder. This was a young band that musically was as good as anybody on that night. They were rehearsed, confident, and armed with a collection of songs that virtually any musician worth his or her salt would kill to have written even one of. Disc two offers no letdown. There's arguably the single most intense read of ~Jungleland~ on tape, and a riotously joyful version of ~Rosalita~ to counter the theater of darkness just visited upon the crowd in the previous song. This version of ~Fourth of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)~ is pure street urchin romance taken to the nth level. The E Streeters' read of the ~Detroit Medley~ is an homage to Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels, whose scorching takes on Little Richard's ~Jenny Take a Ride,~ ~Devil with a Blue Dress,~ and ~Good Golly Miss Molly~ offer spiritual inspiration. They stay on full stun with ~For You~ and cap it all with ~Quarter to Three,~ leaving the crowd to fall back into the night, wondering if they could believe what they'd just witnessed. Springsteen himself says the night was a blur to him and he never looked back for 30 years at the film or even listened to the show. While the soundtrack is only half the experience of the Hammersmith Odeon 1975 document, it's a worthy half and a necessary set to add to any Springsteen live shelf.</p> <p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b></p>"

				"review": "<p>Coming three years, and one extended court battle, after the commercial breakthrough of Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town was highly anticipated. Some attributed the album's embattled tone to Springsteen's legal troubles, but it carried on from Born to Run, in which Springsteen had first begun to view his colorful cast of characters as ~losers.~ On Darkness, he began to see them as the working class. One song was called ~Factory,~ and in another, ~Badlands,~ ~you~ work ~'neath the wheel / Till you get your facts learned.~ Those ~facts~ are that ~Poor man wanna be rich / Rich man wanna be king / And a king ain't satisfied / Till he rules everything.~ But Springsteen's characters, some of whom he inhabited and sang for in the first person, had little and were in danger of losing even that. Their only hope for redemption lay in working harder -- ~You gotta live it everyday,~ he sang in ~Badlands,~ but you also, as another song noted, have to ~Prove It All Night.~ And their only escape lay in driving. Springsteen presented these hard truths in hard rock settings, the tracks paced by powerful drumming and searing guitar solos. Though not as heavily produced as Born to Run, Darkness was given a full-bodied sound, with prominent keyboards and double-tracked vocals. Springsteen's stories were becoming less heroic, but his musical style remained grand. Yet the sound, and the conviction in his singing, added weight to songs like ~Racing in the Street~ and the title track, transforming the pathetic into the tragic. But despite the rock & roll fervor, Darkness was no easy listen, and it served notice that Springsteen was already willing to risk his popularity for his principles. Indeed, Darkness was not as big a seller as Born to Run. And it presaged even starker efforts, such as Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Bruce Springsteen had become increasingly downcast as a songwriter during his recording career, and his pessimism bottomed out with Nebraska. But Born in the U.S.A., his popular triumph, which threw off seven Top Ten hits and became one of the best-selling albums of all time, trafficked in much the same struggle, albeit set to galloping rhythms and set off by chiming guitars. That the witless wonders of the Reagan regime attempted to co-opt the title track as an election-year campaign song wasn't so surprising: the verses described the disenfranchisement of a lower-class Vietnam vet, and the chorus was intended to be angry, but it came off as anthemic. Then, too, Springsteen had softened his message with nostalgia and sentimentality, and those are always crowd-pleasers. ~Glory Days~ may have employed Springsteen's trademark disaffection, yet it came across as a couch potato's drunken lament. But more than anything else, Born in the U.S.A. marked the first time that Springsteen's characters really seemed to relish the fight and to have something to fight for. They were not defeated (~No Surrender~), and they had friendship (~Bobby Jean~) and family (~My Hometown~) to defend. The restless hero of ~Dancing in the Dark~ even pledged himself in the face of futility, and for Springsteen, that was a step. The ~romantic young boys~ of his first two albums, chastened by ~the working life~ encountered on his third, fourth, and fifth albums and having faced the despair of his sixth, were still alive on this, his seventh, with their sense of humor and their determination intact. Born in the U.S.A. was their apotheosis, the place where they renewed their commitment and where Springsteen remembered that he was a rock & roll star, which is how a vastly increased public was happy to treat him.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Fans had been clamoring for a live album for a long time, and with Live 1975-85 they got what they wanted, at least in terms of bulk. His concerts were marathons, and this box set, including 40 tracks and running over three and a half hours, was about the average length of a show. In his brief liner notes, Springsteen spoke of the emergence of the album's ~story~ as he reviewed live tapes, and that story seems nothing less than a history of his life, his concerns, and his career. The first cuts present the Springsteen of the early to mid-'70s; these performances, most of them drawn from a July 1978 show at the Roxy in Los Angeles, give us the romantic, hopeful, earnest Springsteen of ~4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)~ and ~Thunder Road.~ The second section begins with his first Top Ten hit, ~Hungry Heart~ -- this is the Springsteen of the late '70s and early '80s, an arena rock star with working-class concerns. After an acoustic mini-set given largely to material from Nebraska -- songs of economic desperation and crime -- comes a reshuffling of Born in the U.S.A., songs in which Springsteen and his characters start to fight back and rock out. Finally, he brings it all back home to New Jersey, starting with the unofficial state anthem, ~Born to Run,~ and including ~Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out~ and ~Jersey Girl.~ Fans could rejoice that it found room for seven previously unreleased songs, including ~Because the Night,~ but it wasn't as funny, as moving, or as exhilarating as a Springsteen show could be. Maybe no single album, however long, could have been, but where Springsteen impressed in concert because he tried so hard, here he seemed to have tried a little too hard to make a live album carry the freight of everything he had to say.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

It was recorded and released quickly, easily qualifying as the speediest project Springsteen has ever completed. Unfortunately, it occasionally feels a little slapdash, but it's hard to criticize a four-song live charity EP for being haphazardly assembled, since that's in its nature. Nevertheless, Chimes of Freedom is a little unsatisfying, even though it's a good, brief sampler of the Boss live circa Tunnel of Love. And that's part of the problem. Tunnel of Love had a slicker production than a normal Springsteen record, featuring synths scattered throughout the record. Those arrangements were preserved on the live version of ~Tougher Than the Rest,~ one of the best songs from the record, and it turns a little mushy in an arena setting. Similarly, the title track has its chiming opening refrain played on synths, and consequently it sounds a little stiff and dated. These faults are balanced by the remaining two cuts, the first released version of the excellent ~Be True~ and a reworking of ~Born to Run~ as an acoustic ballad. ~Born to Run~ has considerable power in this stripped-down setting, and ~Be True~ teems with life, pointing out how stiff its cousins sound on Chimes of Freedom. Neither of these tracks are major contributions to Springsteen's catalog, but they're nice additions for the die-hard fans who will be picking up the EP anyway.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Bruce Springsteen has always been steeped in mainstream pop/rock music, using it as a vocabulary for what he wanted to say about weightier matters. And he has always written generic pop as well, though he's usually given the results away to performers like Southside Johnny and Gary ~U.S.~ Bonds. Sometimes, those songs have been hits -- think of the Pointer Sisters' ~Fire~ or Bonds' ~This Little Girl Is Mine.~ Occasionally, Springsteen has used such material here and there on his own albums; some of it can be found on The River, for example. But Human Touch was the first Bruce Springsteen album to consist entirely of this kind of minor genre material, material he seems capable of turning out endlessly and effortlessly -- the point of ~I Wish I Were Blind~ is that the singer doesn't want to see, now that his baby has left him; ~57 Channels (And Nothin' On)~ is about TV; ~Real Man~ finds the singer declaring that, while he may not be an action hero like Rambo, he feels like a real man in his baby's arms. And Springsteen, having largely jettisoned the E Street Band (keyboardist Roy Bittan remained), enlisted some sturdy minor talent to play and sing, among them ace studio drummer Jeff Porcaro (on one of his final recording sessions), Sam Moore of Sam & Dave, and Bobby Hatfield of the Righteous Brothers. It's pleasant enough stuff, and easy to listen to, but it is not the kind of record Springsteen had conditioned his audience to expect, and its release brought considerable disappointment. The reaction was exacerbated by the drawn-out release schedule that by 1992 had become common to superstars: this simply wasn't the record Springsteen fans had waited four and a half years to hear. Though at nearly 59 minutes it was the longest single-disc album of his career (which is not even counting the fact that a second whole album was released simultaneously), and though it contained several songs that could have been big hits -- the ~Tunnel of Love~ sound-alike title track, which actually made the Top 40, ~Roll of the Dice,~ an AOR radio favorite, ~Man's Job,~ and even ~Soul Driver,~ which belonged on the next Southside album -- Human Touch was an uninspired Bruce Springsteen album, his first that didn't at least aspire to greatness. Springsteen may have put out the more substantial Lucky Town at the same time in recognition of the relatively slight nature of the material here.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

It was part of the network's Unplugged series, but after performing the first, previously unheard song ~Red Headed Woman~ alone on guitar, Springsteen shouted, ~All right, let's rock it!,~ and departed from the acoustic format. (The album's title has an ~X~ drawn through the ~Un~ of ~Unplugged.~) Eight of the selections come from Springsteen's 1992 albums <i>Human Touch</i> and <i>Lucky Town</i>, and the relatively minor tracks from the former benefit from being sequenced among the more ambitious songs from the latter and such old favorites as ~Darkness on the Edge of Town~ and ~Thunder Road.~ Though Springsteen and his new band don't ~rock it~ too hard for the most part, a notable exception is a performance of the previously unrecorded ~Light of Day,~ a title song Springsteen wrote for a 1987 movie. Here, he gives a taste of the enthusiasm and spontaneity he can bring to his live performances. But this is an album of small pleasures rather than a major performance statement.</p>&mdash; <b>William Ruhlmann</b>"

				"review": "<p>Another superb live performance in a career filled with them, <i>MTV Unplugged: Bruce Springsteen in Concert (Plugged)</i> finds the Boss at an interesting point in his life, musically and otherwise. Working without the E Street Band (except keyboardist Roy Bittan) for the time being, having divorced one wife and married another (singer and bandmate Patty Scialfa), Springsteen had released <i>Human Touch</i> and <i>Lucky Town</i>, two ~solo~ records, about eight months before this November 1992 MTV appearance. Selections from those two underrated albums account for over half of this 114-minute set's 19 songs (including three that weren't part of the original broadcast), and while Bruce is still Bruce (~Human Touch,~ for instance, is a classic Springsteen song), some changes are definitely apparent. He has always been an impassioned performer, but he seems genuinely energized by the presence of Scialfa (can ~Red-Headed Woman~ be about anyone but her?) and his young new band, including guitarist Shane Fontayne, drummer Zachary Alford, and no less than five backup singers. These folks rock their butts off, basically, especially on a wild, extended version of ~Light of Day~; there's even some experimentation happening, like the various sound effects added to ~57 Channels (and Nothin' On).~ OK, so there's no ~Born in the U.S.A.~ or ~Born to Run~; as far as standards go, you'll have to be satisfied with ~Atlantic City,~ ~Glory Days,~ and an acoustic ~Thunder Road~ (Live in New York City, another superb DVD, is heavier on the hits). Anyway you slice it, Plugged is another welcome addition to the Springsteen catalog.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Sam Graham</strong></p>"

He returned to work in the fall of 1991, intending to add a song, but ended up recording a whole new album, Lucky Town, and then decided to release both records at the same time in the spring of 1992. He might have been better off pulling a couple of the stronger songs from the earlier album, adding them to the later one (which runs less than 40 minutes), and shelving the rest. While Human Touch was a disappointing album of second-rate material, Lucky Town is an ambitious collection addressing many of Springsteen's major concerns and moving them forward. Here was the rage and the humor, the sense of compassion, the loyalty and commitment that had been the stuff of Springsteen's best music from the beginning. Songs like ~Better Days~ and ~Local Hero~ commented on and deflated the commercial success with which Springsteen clearly felt uncomfortable; ~If I Should Fall Behind~ and ~Book of Dreams~ expressed romantic fidelity and generosity; ~Souls of the Departed~ contained scathing social commentary; and ~My Beautiful Reward~ was a meditative epilogue. The lyrics were better, the arrangements tighter, the performances more powerful than those on the companion release. If Lucky Town, like Tunnel of Love and Human Touch before it, sounded a little under-produced, it nevertheless had the mark of the major artist Springsteen is, and if he had released it alone, it might have had a more significant impact.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Just as he had followed his 1980 commercial breakthrough The River with the challenging Nebraska, Bruce Springsteen followed the most popular album of his career, Born in the U.S.A., with another low-key, anguished effort, Tunnel of Love. Especially in their sound, several of the songs, ~Cautious Man~ and ~Two Faces,~ for example, could have fit seamlessly onto Nebraska, though the arrangements overall were not as stripped-down and acoustic as on the earlier album. While Nebraska was filled with songs of economic desperation, however, Tunnel of Love, as its title suggested, was an album of romantic exploration. But the lovers were just as desperate in their way as Nebraska's small-time criminals. In song after song, Springsteen questioned the trust and honesty on both sides in a romantic relationship, specifically a married relationship. Since Springsteen sounded more autobiographical than ever before (~Ain't Got You~ referred to his popular success, while ~Walk Like a Man~ seemed another explicit message to his father), it was hard not to wonder about the state of his own two-and-a-half-year marriage, and it wasn't surprising when that marriage collapsed the following year. Tunnel of Love was not the album that the ten million fans who had bought Born in the U.S.A. as of 1987 were waiting for, and though it topped the charts, sold three million copies, and spawned three Top 40 hits, much of this was on career momentum. Springsteen was as much at a crossroads with his audience as he seemed to be in his work and in his personal life, though this was not immediately apparent.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Here's the challenge in putting together a Bruce Springsteen compilation: though he scored 18 Top 40 hits (12 of which made the Top Ten) through 1994, Springsteen is not a ~singles artist.~ Some of his biggest hits have come with his slightest or least characteristic material; he has written numerous songs that were hits for other artists; and some of his most memorable songs were not released as singles. While a Springsteen ~hits~ collection logically would contain such Top Ten singles as ~I'm on Fire~ and his cover of Edwin Starr's ~War,~ few Springsteen fans would miss their omission; on the other hand, many would support the inclusion of ~Blinded by the Light~ and ~Pink Cadillac,~ Top Ten hits for Manfred Mann's Earth Band and Natalie Cole; and anyone even remotely familiar with Springsteen's albums and concerts would have trouble countenancing the absence of such non-singles as ~Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)~ and ~Thunder Road.~ Facing this challenge, Springsteen has adopted his own set of criteria. First, he seems to have wanted to pack as much music onto a single disc as possible, the result being a CD-busting 76:47 running time. Second, he seems to have wanted to include as many tracks as possible, even if that means editing songs; as a result, 18 tracks are included, though five have been substantially shortened -- ~My Hometown~ (by 24 seconds), ~Glory Days~ (by 29 seconds), ~Human Touch~ (by 82 seconds), ~Better Days~ (by 23 seconds), and ~Streets of Philadelphia~ (by 60 seconds). Third, like many artists, he is more interested in including his recent material than his older material, so there is nothing from Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. or The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle -- no ~Blinded by the Light,~ ~Spirit in the Night,~ ~4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy),~ or ~Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)~ -- but both sides of his 1992 single ~Human Touch~/~Better Days~ are included. Fourth, he has not felt bound to interpret the album's title to mean he must include his most successful singles: the Top 40 hits ~Prove It All Night~ and ~One Step Up~ and the Top Tens ~Cover Me,~ ~I'm on Fire,~ ~I'm Goin' Down,~ ~War,~ and ~Tunnel of Love~ are left off, while the album tracks ~Thunder Road,~ ~The River,~ and ~Atlantic City~ and the minor chart single ~Badlands~ are included. Fifth, he has opted to include both a couple of new songs (~Secret Garden~ and ~Blood Brothers~), a previously unreleased outtake (~Murder Incorporated~), and a new recording of a previously unreleased old song (~This Hard Land~). All of which is to say that Greatest Hits is a hodgepodge. Springsteen considered calling it something other than Greatest Hits (one idea: This Hard Land), and that might have been a better idea if he was going to fiddle with the concept this much. Nevertheless, some of Springsteen's best and best-known hit recordings are here -- ~Born to Run,~ ~Hungry Heart,~ ~Dancing in the Dark,~ ~Born in the U.S.A.,~ and the then-recent ~Streets of Philadelphia,~ the success of which probably prompted the release of this compilation in the first place.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>In 1982, with Ronald Reagan in the White House and much of America torn between a newly fierce patriotism and the dispassionate conservatism of the dawning ~Greed Is Good~ era, a number of roots-oriented rock musicians began examining the State of the Union in song, and one of the most powerful albums to come out of this movement was Bruce Springsteen's stark, home-recorded masterpiece Nebraska. In 1995, Bill Clinton was president, America was congratulating itself for a new era of high-tech peace and prosperity, and Springsteen returned to the themes and approach of Nebraska with The Ghost of Tom Joad, an album that suggested little had changed in the past 13 years -- except Americans had gotten better at ignoring the increasingly sharp divide between the rich and the poor, and that illegal aliens who had come to America looking for the fabled Land of Milk and Honey were being forced to shoulder a heavy and dangerous burden in America's underground economy. With several of its songs drawn directly from news stories, The Ghost of Tom Joad is more explicitly political than Nebraska (more so than anything in Springsteen's catalog, for that matter), and while the arrangements are more full-bodied than those on Nebraska (five cuts feature a full band), the production and the overall tone is, if anything, even starker and more low-key, with the lyrics all the more powerful for their spare backdrops. While there's an undertow of bitterness in this album's tales of an America that has turned its back on the working class and the foreign-born, there's also a tremendous compassion in songs like ~The Line,~ ~Sinaloa Cowboys,~ ~Balboa Park,~ and the title cut, which lend their subjects a dignity fate failed to give them. Individually, these songs, either angry or plaintive, are clean and expertly drawn tales of life along this nation's margins, and their cumulative effect is nothing short of heartbreaking; anyone who pegged Springsteen as a zealously patriotic conservative in the wake of the widely misunderstood Born in the U.S.A. needs to hear this disc. The Ghost of Tom Joad failed to find the same audience (or the same wealth of media attention) that embraced Nebraska, but on it's own terms it's a striking and powerful album, and certainly one of Springsteen's most deeply personal works.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>For years, decades even, Bruce Springsteen was legendary for the amount of recordings he did not release. Every time he cut an album, he recorded a surplus of songs and left some out, not always on the basis of quality, but often because they simply didn't suit the mood of the record. It was inevitable that dedicated fans and collectors would bootleg these recordings, and for many years, he was one of the most popular bootlegged artists, rivaling even Bob Dylan. Dylan released a box set of unreleased songs in 1991, paving the way for the long-overdue appearance of a similar Springsteen set, Tracks, in 1998. Spanning four discs, it isn't entirely devoted to unreleased material -- a few B-sides pop up here and there -- nor is it truly definitive, since it misses a number of key outtakes, plus his original version of ~Because the Night,~ the sole hit for Patti Smith. Instead, the compilation is an unassuming sampling of what's in the vaults, from his early acoustic demos to polished outtakes from Human Touch and Lucky Town. Along the way, there are a number of great songs -- ~Bishop Danced~ is every bit as terrific as its legend, as are ~Thundercrack,~ ~Give the Girl a Kiss,~ ~Hearts of Stone,~ ~Roulette,~ and many others. Tracks merely offers fans an enjoyably sequenced selection of what was left behind. If the end result isn't as revelatory as some may have expected (even the acoustic ~Born in the U.S.A.,~ powerful as it is, doesn't sound any different than you may have imagined it), it's because Springsteen is, at heart, a solid craftsman, not a blinding visionary like Dylan. That's why Tracks is for the dedicated fan, where The Bootleg Series and The Basement Tapes are flat-out essential for rock fans.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

The issue of record company greed aside, the greatest disservice is actually to those listeners who buy the disc as a substitute for the full Tracks box; each of its 66 cuts is an invaluable addition to the Springsteen songbook, so even casual fans need the complete package to discover lost classics like ~Thundercrack,~ ~Give the Girl a Kiss,~ ~Wages of Sin,~ and ~The Wish~ — just 18 of these gems are simply not enough. Which means, then, that 18 Tracks is ultimately most essential for those hardcore fans who already shelled out for most of the material in question anyway; and though it's appalling to force the devoted to buy a full-length album for just three new songs, at least each is excellent, in particular longtime fan favorites ~The Fever~ and ~The Promise~ (the latter newly recorded for inclusion here).</p><p><b>&mdash; Jason Ankeny</b></p>"

				"review": "<p>The many voices that come out of the ether on Bruce Springsteen's The Rising all seem to have two things in common: the first is that they are writing from the other side, from the day after September 11, 2001, the day when life began anew, more uncertain than ever before. The other commonality that these voices share is the determination that life, however fraught with tragedy and confusion, is precious and should be lived as such. On this reunion with the E Street Band, Bruce Springsteen offers 15 meditations -- in grand rock & roll style -- on his own way of making sense of the senseless. The band is in fine form, though with Brendan O'Brien's uncanny production, they play with an urgency and rawness they've seldom shown. This may not have been the ideal occasion for a reunion after 15 years, but it's one they got, and they go for broke. The individual tracks offer various glimpses of loss, confusion, hope, faith, resolve, and a good will that can only be shown by those who have been tested by fire. The music and production is messy, greasy; a lot of the mixes bleed tracks onto one another, giving it a more homemade feel than any previous E Street Band outing. And yes, that's a very good thing.</p><p>The set opens with ~Lonesome Day,~ a midtempo rocker with country-ish roots. Springsteen's protagonist admits to his or her shortcomings in caring for the now-absent beloved. But despite the grief and emptiness, there is a wisdom that emerges in questioning what remains: ~Better ask questions before you shoot/Deceit and betrayal's bitter fruit/It's hard to swallow come time to pay/That taste on your tongue don't easily slip away/Let kingdom come/I'm gonna find my way/ Through this lonesome day.~ Brendan O'Brien's hurdy-gurdy cuts through the mix like a ghost, offering a view of an innocent past that has been forever canceled because it never was anyway; the instrument, like the glockenspiels that trim Bruce Springsteen's songs, offers not only texture, but a kind of formalist hint that possibilities don't always lie in the future. Lest anyone mistakenly perceive this recording as a somber evocation of loss and despair, it should also be stated that this is very much an E Street Band recording. Clarence Clemons is everywhere, and the R&B swing and slip of the days of yore is in the house -- especially on ~Waitin' for a Sunny Day,~ ~Countin' on a Miracle,~ ~Mary's Place~ (with a full horn section), and the souled-out ~Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin).~ These tracks echo the past with their loose good-time feel, but ~echo~ is the key word. Brendan O'Brien's guitar-accented production offers us an E Street Band coming out of the ether and stepping in to fill a void. The songs themselves are, without exception, rooted in loss, but flower with the possibility of moving into what comes next, with a hard-won swagger and busted-up grace. They offer balance and a shifting perspective, as well as a depth that is often deceptive.</p><p>The title track is one of Springsteen's greatest songs. It is an anthem, but not in the sense you usually reference in regard to his work. This anthem is an invitation to share everything, to accept everything, to move through everything individually and together. Power-chorded guitars and pianos entwine in the choruses with a choir, and Clemons wails on a part with a stinging solo. With The Rising, Springsteen has found a way to be inclusive and instructive without giving up his particular vision as a songwriter, nor his considerable strength as a rock & roll artist. In fact, if anything, The Rising is one of the very best examples in recent history of how popular art can evoke a time period and all of its confusing and often contradictory notions, feelings, and impulses. There are tales of great suffering in The Rising to be sure, but there is joy, hope, and possibility, too. Above all, there is a celebration and reverence for everyday life. And if we need anything from rock & roll, it's that. It would be unfair to lay on Bruce Springsteen the responsibility of guiding people through the aftermath of a tragedy and getting on with the business of living, but rock & roll as impure, messy, and edifying as this helps.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>In the liner notes to his volume of Columbia's Essential series, Bruce Springsteen immediately lays out the problem with hits collections: ~In any body of work there are obvious high points. The rest depends on who's doing the listening. Where you were, when it was, who you were with when a particular song or album cut the deepest.~ All artists have this problem, but Springsteen has it more than most, since he not only has a deep and varied body of work, but he has a passionate, dedicated fan base. Within that following, there are listeners who prefer his big-hearted, sprawling early work, those who love the cinematic grandeur of Born to Run, those who love his stark, intimate acoustic ballads, and those who adore his pile-driving rockers. He's had hits in all of these styles, and he's had concert and album rock radio staples in all those styles -- all of these tunes for his basic canon, the ~obvious high points~ -- but he's such a strong songwriter and record-maker that this leaves behind songs that many other artists would be thrilled to call their best work, whether it's the epic street poetry of ~It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City~ or the old-time rock & roll throwaway of ~Pink Cadillac.~ Neither of those tunes are on the double-disc, 30-track Essential Bruce Springsteen, but any two-disc set can't hold all of Springsteen's great songs. It can only offer a representative sampling, which means there will be lots of terrific tracks and fan favorites absent -- Springsteen admits this, citing ~Growin' Up,~ ~Racing in the Street,~ ~Backstreets,~ and ~My City of Ruins~ as MIA, while others could make just as convincing an argument for ~My Hometown,~ ~Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,~ ~Fade Away,~ ~I'm on Fire,~ ~Prove It All Night,~ ~Adam Raised a Cain,~ and the list goes on. The strength of The Essential is that you never notice these songs are missing. Unlike the previous Bruce compilation, the misguided, haphazardly selected Greatest Hits, The Essential contains all the big songs -- not just the obvious hits of ~Hungry Heart,~ ~Born to Run,~ ~Born in the U.S.A.,~ and ~Glory Days,~ but selections from his first two albums that were ignored completely the previous time out -- and it also contains just the right amount of latter-day material from the acclaimed The Rising, plus ~American Skin (41 Shots)~ and ~Land of Hope and Dreams,~ two songs previously only available on Live in New York City. It adds up to an ideal introduction to Springsteen's music, capturing all sides of his musical output while being a hell of a good listen.</p><p>While the two main discs are for neophytes and casual fans, the third ~bonus~ disc is for the hardcore -- the kind of fans who will argue about the song selection on the previous two discs, and would be more interested in unreleased material than hits. This third disc is a clearing-house for items that should have made it to his previous rarities collection, Tracks, but didn't. This includes previously unreleased cuts, B-sides, contributions to soundtracks and benefit albums, covers, and an alternate, ~country-blues~ acoustic version of ~Countin' on a Miracle~ from The Rising. The disc follows a roughly chronological sequence and basically divides into early-'80s material and mid-'90s material. The '80s material has the edge due to the variety and strength of the material: the rampaging rocker ~From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come),~ a song Bruce gave to Dave Edmunds and has never released before now; the spare, tough ~The Big Payback,~ a B-side; the searching ~None but the Brave,~ cut during the Born in the U.S.A. sessions; the evocative ~County Fair,~ cut after Nebraska; a cover of Jimmy Cliff's ~Trapped,~ cut on the River tour; a wonderfully raucous live ~Held Up Without a Gun,~ a variation on ~You Can Look but You Better Not Touch~ with topical lyrics previously released as a B-side. These are fantastic performances, and while there are also very good cuts of a more recent vintage -- such as the Joe Grushecky collaboration ~Code of Silence,~ his title song from Tim Robbins' Dead Man Walking, and a fun version of ~Viva Las Vegas~ -- these '80s songs are the heart of the collection. It's an unexpected gift to have them officially released as a bonus disc to a hits collection, and for the hardcore, it's worth buying two discs of songs you already have just get these rarities. And it helps make The Essential Bruce Springsteen really live up to its title.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Every decade or so, Bruce Springsteen releases a somber album of narrative songs, character sketches, and folk tunes -- records that play not like rock & roll, but rather as a collection of short stories. <i>Nebraska</i>, released in the fall of 1982 during the rise of Reagan's America, was the first of these, with the brooding <i>The Ghost of Tom Joad</i> following in 1995, in the thick of the Clinton administration but before the heady boom days of the late '90s. At the midpoint of George W. Bush's administration, Springsteen released <i>Devils & Dust</i>, another collection of story songs that would seem on the surface to be a companion to <i>Nebraska</i> and <i>Ghost</i>, but in actuality is quite a different record than either. While the characters that roam through <i>Devils & Dust</i> are similarly heartbroken, desperate, and downtrodden, they're far removed from the criminals and renegades of <i>Nebraska</i>, and the album doesn't have the political immediacy of <i>Ghost's</i> latter-day Woody Guthrie-styled tales -- themes that tied together those two albums. Here, the songs and stories are loosely connected. Several are set in the West, some are despairing, some have signs of hope, a couple are even sweet and light. Springsteen's writing is similarly varied, occasionally hearkening back to the spare, dusty prose of <i>Nebraska</i>, but often it's densely composed, assured, and evocative, written as if the songs were meant to be read aloud, not sung. But the key to <i>Devils & Dust</i>, and why it's his strongest record in a long time, is that the music is as vivid and varied as the words.</p><p>Unlike the meditative, monochromatic <i>The Ghost of Tom Joad</i>, this has different shades of color, so somber epics like ~The Hitter~ or the sad, lonely ~Reno~ are balanced by the lighter ~Long Time Comin',~ ~Maria's Bed,~ and ~All I'm Thinkin' About,~ while the moodier ~Black Cowboys~ and ~Devils & Dust~ are enhanced by subtly cinematic productions. It results in a record that's far removed in feel from the stark, haunting Nebraska, but on a song-for-song level, it's nearly as strong, since its stories linger in the imagination as long as the ones from that 1982 masterpiece (and they stick around longer than those from Ghost, as well). <i>Devils & Dust</i> is also concise and precisely constructed, two things the otherwise excellent 2002 comeback <i>The Rising</i> was not, and that sharp focus helps make this the leanest, artiest, and simply best Springsteen record in many years. [<i>Devils & Dust</i> was released only as a DualDisc, a disc that contains a CD on one side and a DVD on the flip. The DVD contains a 5.1 mix of the album, plus a 30-minute film containing interviews with Springsteen and footage of him performing five songs live in the upstairs of a house; in other words, it's a staged performance, not a concert. The interviews are enjoyable, if not particularly interesting, while the live acoustic performances are not strictly unadorned -- ~Reno~ has pianos and synthesizers discreetly murmuring in the background, ~All I'm Thinkin' About~ has synths and backing vocals. It's a fine little film, but not something that merits frequent repeat viewings. The CD side appears to be copy-protected -- it did not read in either a PC with Windows XP or a Mac with OSX, so it cannot easily be ripped as MP3s].</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<p>We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions is an unusual Bruce Springsteen album in a number of ways. First, it's the first covers album Springsteen has recorded in his three-decade career, which is a noteworthy event in itself, but that's not the only thing different about We Shall Overcome. Springsteen, a notorious perfectionist who has been known to tweak and rework albums numerous times before releasing them (or scrapping them, as the case may be), pulled together the album quickly, putting aside a planned second volume of the rarities collection Tracks after discovering a set of recordings he made in 1997 for a Pete Seeger tribute album called Where Have All the Flowers Gone: The Songs of Pete Seeger. Enthralled by this handful of tracks -- one of which, ~We Shall Overcome,~ appeared on the tribute -- Springsteen decided to cut a whole album of folk tunes popularized by Pete Seeger. He rounded up 13 musicians, including some who played on those 1997 sessions, and did two one-day sessions in late 2005 and early 2006, swiftly releasing the resulting album that April. As Bruce stresses in his introductory liner notes, these were live recordings, done with no rehearsals, and We Shall Overcome does indeed have an unmistakably loose feel, and not just because you can hear the Boss call out chord changes in a handful of songs. This music is rowdy and rambling, as the group barrels head-first into songs that they're playing together as a band for the first time, and it's hard not to get swept up along in their excitement. Springsteen has made plenty of great records, but We Shall Overcome is unique in its sheer kinetic energy; he has never made a record that feels as alive as this.</p><p>Not only does We Shall Overcome feel different than Bruce's work; it also feels different than Seeger's music. Most of Seeger's recordings were spare and simple, featuring just him and his banjo; his most elaborately produced records were with the Weavers, whose recordings of the '50s did feature orchestration, yet that's a far cry from the big folk band that Springsteen uses here. Bruce's combo for the Seeger sessions has a careening, ramshackle feel that's equal parts early-'60s hootenanny and Bob Dylan and the Band's Americana; at times, its ragged human qualities also recall latter-day Tom Waits, although the music here is nowhere near as self-consciously arty as that. Springsteen has truly used Seeger's music as inspiration, using it as the starting point to take him someplace that is uniquely his own in sheer musical terms. Given that, it should be no great surprise that Bruce also picks through Seeger's songbook in a similar fashion, leaving many (if not most) of Pete's well-known songs behind in favor of a selection of folk standards Springsteen learned through Seeger's recordings. (Author/critic Dave Marsh researched the origins of each song here; there are brief introductions within the album's liner notes and thorough histories presented on the official Springsteen site.) While the songs featured here adhere to no one specific theme -- there are work songs, spirituals, narratives, and protest songs -- it is possible to see this collection of tunes as Springsteen's subtle commentary on the political state of America, especially given Seeger's reputation as an outspoken political activist, but this record should hardly be judged as merely an old-fashioned folk record. We Shall Overcome is many things, but a creaky relic is not one of them. Springsteen has drawn from Seeger's songbook -- which he assembled in the '40s, '50s, and '60s from traditional folk songs -- and turned it into something fresh and contemporary. And even if you have no patience for (or interest in) the history of the songs, or their possible meanings, it's easy to enjoy We Shall Overcome on pure musical terms: it's a rambunctious, freewheeling, positively joyous record unlike any other in Springsteen's admittedly rich catalog.</p><p>[We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions was released in the U.S. as a DualDisc, containing a CD on one side and a DVD on the other. The CD side merely contains the album. The DVD contains the album in PCM stereo (there's no 5.1 mix, although given the big-band nature of this session, this album would have sounded great in Surround Sound), along with two bonus tracks, the rollicking ~Buffalo Gals~ and the moody, soulful ~How Can I Keep from Singing.~ Both bonus cuts are excellent and should have been on the album proper. There is also a 30-minute video program that chronicles some of the recording of the album, but it's not a documentary: it's more of a performance film with commentary, and while it could have been longer or had more commentary, it's still quite enjoyable. Finally, We Shall Overcome also was released separately as a vinyl LP.]</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<P>Live in Dublin by Bruce Springsteen with the Seeger Sessions band documents the final show of the group's long tour in support of the album that took them across the U.S. and Europe. Along with performances from the album itself, the show is peppered with Springsteen's own tunes. The deluxe double-CD contains 23 songs performed by a 17-piece band that includes a full horn section, backing chorus, numerous guitars, dobro, banjo, keyboards, accordion, field drums, sousaphone, euphonium, pedal steel, fiddles, standup bass, and more. The most prominently featured members of the band include Soozie Tyrell, Marc Anthony Thompson, and, of course, Patti Scialfa (who all offer wonderful duet performances). This recording stands in sharp contrast both musically and emotionally to the studio offering. We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions was recorded by a band that captured immediacy and intimacy: there is a certain raw savoir faire resulting in a bristling kind of joyous energy that only a large group of musicians unfamiliar with one another can provide. Springsteen's a perfectionist; some of the rough edges left on the studio album are a welcome surprise. Here, many of those same songs — many of which come from out of history and time — are performed by a band that became a spit-shined, polished, and utterly professional unit.</P><P>Live in Dublin offers dazzling versions that have been honed and sharpened. This is a long way from Pete Seeger and his solitary banjo playing singalongs for folk festival audiences all over the globe; and yet, somehow not. But there is something more detached about this show — and the video doubly enhances that studied feeling — though its sheer musicality and virtuosity is a wonder. The horn charts are brilliant; there is room in some of these tunes, such as ~Erie Canal,~ for old New Orleans jazz-styled soloing and interplay; the mannered time keeping is captured not only by drums and bass, but by the chorus' vocal phrasing. The show opener, ~Atlantic City,~ is radically rearranged; it's now a near-monotone blues song. In this way it resembles the kind of re-tooling that Bob Dylan often gives his songs live to keep them interesting. Other tracks from Springsteen's catalog on the first disc include ~If I Should Fall Behind.~ This one is done — at first — as a tender 19th century waltz between Scialfa and her husband. Then it transforms itself seamlessly into a communal sing, and in this way becomes a different song altogether, less intimate, but perhaps more profound. The pedal steel guitar treatment in ~Highway Patrolman~ is enhanced with upright piano, multiple acoustic guitars, and pedal steel. Springsteen's new version of Blind Alfred Reed's ~How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live~ premiered at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 2006. It's complete with added lyrics that highlight the plight of Hurricane Katrina survivors; here it remains raucous and forceful. ~O Mary Don't You Weep~ is more fully a gospel tune here, its dynamic is over the top. ~Jacob's Ladder~ (a Seeger original) closes disc one.</P><P>It's a wild Dixieland cum gospel romp with full-on horns (including Sousaphone), popping field snare, and bass drum. Tyrell's great violin break — sometimes it seems as if she ~gets it~ in terms of the historical nature of these songs better than anyone else in this band — and wide ranging call and response chorale are a breathtaking finish. ~Long Time Comin'~ from Devils &amp; Dust opens disc two, and this reading is a far more compelling one. Like ~If I Should Fall Behind,~ it's so much bigger than the songwriter. It belongs not only in this mix, but in the way it's performed to the culture as shared experience. It's followed by an overly long, radical redo of ~Open All Night.~ executed as a late-'50s rock &amp; roll song with a very polished Andrews Sisters-styled female scat, before a male chorus engages them in call and response. It sounds more like something from Pump Boys at the Dinette , or, better yet, Guys and Dolls. It's a way of kickstarting a crowd for the second set; and no matter what one thinks of it musically, it works to that purpose. The Western swing (think Asleep at the Wheel) pedal steel solo and Sam Bardfeld's fiddle solo kick it into high gear, not to mention Springsteen's own acoustic guitar solo; and as has been proven thus far, the horn charts are spectacular. The accordion, fiddle, and brass driven ~Pay Me My Money Down~ is an entirely new reading of the traditional number. Its easy Cajun-esque 2-step and chorus-line-chorus structure is the loosest and most spontaneous-sounding thing on this entire set.</P><P>There are great surprises for anyone who didn't see this tour with the inclusion in the set list of both ~Growin' Up~ and ~Blinded by the Light,~ from Springsteen's debut album (the latter is a bonus cut). The former begins as a solo acoustic tune with a new melody and becomes a string and horn driven, skittering country song. The latter, with a Latin rhythm, Cuban son structure, and minor key signature, is a new song entirely. In addition, Springsteen's inventive folk song treatment of ~When the Saints Go Marching In~ is here, as is the singalong gospel number ~This Little Light of Mine.~ This, as the official close of the show, is a crowd-pleaser and a barnstormer. The chorus vocals are simply stunning. The band just burns as a unit, and for a moment or two, it feels as if the charts have been burned and they are on the wire without a net. Two other bonus tracks are included (they were recorded for the original Seeger Sessions offering but not included on the final CD). They are Live in Dublin takes of John Hurley's and Ronnie Wilkins' ~Love of the Common People~ and ~We Shall Overcome.~ These feel like they add something to the sense of heritage that initially gave birth to the Seeger Sessions project. ~We Shall Overcome~ is a defining moment here. Introduced by Springsteen as: ~This is the kinda the song that got us started here, so uh...~; it's a soft-spoken element of surprise that closes the entire release with a moving and even spiritual sense of dignity. It is also the only song here that doesn't feel like a number Springsteen has remade in his own musical image.For many listeners, this will seem like a wild celebration, yet all the polish and glimmer this band displays — perhaps unavoidable after such a long run playing together — feels very different, not distant so much involved in the song as in the performance. It feels like a recording that doesn't resemble the songs of the ~people~ any longer, but more like another live — and far more musically adventurous — Bruce Springsteen record. Not that there is anything wrong with that at all. It simply means that what was mercurial and puzzling and sometimes even maddening about The Seeger Sessions as an album feels defined and perhaps even actually finished here. Not just the in the sense of the band being at the end of a tour, either; it could be, perhaps, the end of a phase in his career (the jury is out on that for now), but more likely, that with Live in Dublin, something is lost as well as gained: it feels as if all of these songs as performed on this set — not just the ones Springsteen penned — have now become part of his catalog rather than part of his repertoire. While these songs have been part of a standard repertoire for many artists and front porch singers, they've never felt ~owned~ by anyone before now. Here, Springsteen owns them. [In addition to the double-CD version is a CD/DVD deluxe version that was filmed in high definition. Containing all 23 performances and a choice of Dolby Digital Surround or PCM sound, the bonus track performances are included as a separate chapter, along with a replica of the set list.]</P><P>— <B>Thom Jurek</B></P>"

				"review": "<p>Hailed as Bruce Springsteen's return to rock upon its release in fall 2007, Magic isn't quite as straightforward as that description would have it seem. True, this does mark another reunion with the E Street Band, only his second studio album with the group since 1984's Born in the U.S.A., giving this a rock & roll heft missing from his two previous albums -- the dusty, literary Devils & Dust and the raucous We Shall Overcome: The Pete Seeger Sessions -- and unlike The Rising, the first E Street Band album of the new millennium, there is no overarching theme here. It's just a collection of songs, something that Bruce hasn't done since Human Touch, or maybe even The River. All the ingredients are in place for a simple, straight-ahead rock album, except for two things: Springsteen didn't write a lot of flat-out rock songs, and with his producer Brendan O'Brien, he didn't make an album that sounds much like a rock & roll album, either. Magic is bright and punchy, a digital-age production through and through, right down to how each track feels as if it were crafted according to its own needs instead of the record as a whole.</p><p>Underneath this shiny veneer, the E Street Band can still lift this music toward great heights, infusing it with a sense of majesty, but this is an E Street Band that was recorded piecemeal in the studio, pasted together track by track as the group fit sessions into their busy schedules. This approach gives the album a bit of a mannered, meticulous sound not unlike The Rising, but such careful construction was appropriate for Springsteen's cautious, caring 9/11 rumination; on Magic it tends to keep the music from reaching full flight. Then again, the songs here don't quite lend themselves to either the transcendent sweep of Born to Run or the down-n-dirty roadhouse rockers that cluttered The River. There's a quiet melancholy underpinning this album. It's evident even on the hard-driving ~Radio Nowhere,~ whose charging guitars mask a sense of desperation, or the deceptively breezy ~Girls in Their Summer Clothes,~ which grows more wistful with each passing chorus. ~Girls~ is also indicative of how Magic doesn't quite feel like classic E Street Band, even when it offers reminders of their classic sound: like ~Born to Run,~ it trades upon Phil Spector, but here the band doesn't absorb the Wall of Sound; they evoke it, giving the song a nostalgic bent that emphasizes the soft sadness in his melody. This oddly bittersweet vibe that is shared by ~Your Own Worst Enemy,~ whose baroque harpsichords -- uncannily reminiscent of the Left Banke -- are the biggest curveball here.</p><p>That is, it's the biggest specific curveball outside of the overall feel of Magic, which is far too somber to be called just another rock & roll album. The solemn, sepia-toned picture of the Boss on the cover is a pretty big tip-off that there may not be a whole lot of good times coming on Magic, but it's a surprise that this is not only not as joyous as We Shall Overcome, it doesn't have as many moments of sunny relief as The Rising, which had ~Waitin' on a Sunny Day~ and ~Mary's Place~ among its quiet, artful grief. Here, the joy and the sadness are fused, skewing such otherwise lively numbers as ~Livin' in the Future~ -- which otherwise sounds like it could sneak onto the second side of Born in the U.S.A. -- toward the sober side. Springsteen also targets war and politics throughout the album, either through metaphors (the title track, where the audience is suckered by a con man) or blunt declarations (~Last to Die~). All this toil and tension doesn't make for a very fun album, but 2007 isn't a very fun time, so it's an appropriate reflection of the time. The thing of it is, despite some fine moments of craft -- both musical and lyrical, whether on ~Gypsy Biker~ or ~Long Walk Home~ -- the songs aren't written with the keen literary eye that made Devils & Dust play like a collection of short stories. Like the music, the words just feel a shade too deliberate, rendering Magic just a bit too overthought -- hardly enough to make for a bad record, but one that isn't quite grabbing, even if it is helped immeasurably by the E Street Band in old pro mode. And what's missing comes into sharp relief as the album draws to a close with ~Terry's Song,~ a quickly written and recorded tribute to Terry Magovern, Springsteen's longtime friend and assistant. Compared to the rest of the album, this simple tune is a bit ragged, but it's soulful, moving, and indelible, immediate where the rest of the album is a shade distant. After hearing it, it's hard not to wish that Bruce would record this way all the time.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Viewers are able to see Springsteen spontaneously directing the E Street Band and shaping the show as it evolves. The set list spans from 'Born To Run' era to 'Working On a Dream' and includes rare covers such as The Clash's ~London Calling,~ Jimmy Cliff's ~Trapped,~ The Young Rascals' ~Good Lovin',~ and Eddie Floyd's ~Raise Your Hand.~ Springsteen also performs fan favorite ~Hard Times (Come Again No More),~ written by Stephen Foster in 1854. Brian Fallon from The Gaslight Anthem joins the band as a guest vocalist on Springsteen's own ~No Surrender.~ GRAMMY and Emmy Award-winning producer and editor Thom Zimny and director Chris Hilson, both members of Springsteen's video team dating back over a decade, oversaw the film. Audio was mixed by Bob Clearmountain. Bonus material includes stunning footage of ~The River~ from Glastonbury, June 27; and the full music video for ~Wrecking Ball,~ filmed at New Jersey's Giants Stadium.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Amazon</strong></p><hr /><p>Highly anticipated by fans of The Boss, and those who track high-profile concert DVDs generally, the new release from Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band is a hot and sweaty rock 'n' roll spectacle, just in time for summer in the city.<p>London Calling Live In Hyde Park documents the band's showcase last summer in London's central public green space - the equivalent of New York City's Central Park. Even by big event standards, this is an oversized gig — the London crowd stretches on for what seems like miles, and Bruce and the band are clearly in outdoor festival mode.</p><p>Mr. Springsteen is legendary, of course, for outsized concert events, and his stamina as a performer is ridiculous. Three-hour concerts are the norm for the E Street crew, and they don't disappoint here - the 2-DVD set clocks in at just under 180 minutes, counting the included pair of extra tracks (~The River~ from the previous night's warm-up gig, and the music video for ~Wrecking Ball.~)</p><p>In fact, the show outlasts the sun, beginning in broad daylight and proceeding through a gorgeous sunset at Hyde Park. As the last numbers wind down in the blue glow of London twilight, it becomes clear that this is a genius move on the part of the producers. Mother Nature provides a better light show that any team of technicians could have wired.</p><p>Springsteen kicks off the show with a relatively faithful cover of the Clash's immortal call-to-arms ~London Calling.~ Pulling at the song's insistent, staccato chords, Springsteen gives early notice that he's not horsing around. It's an odd sight to see Springsteen signing those famous lines about nuclear errors and London drowning, but it works. If he can't quite match the snarling intensity of Joe Strummer's original vocals — well, he very nearly does, and that counts for something.</p><p>The set list from here bounces all around, with numbers going back to the Born to Run era all the way up through the latest album, Working on a Dream. Besides the opening Clash number, Bruce peppers in a few more covers, including ~Good Lovin',~ Jimmy Cliff's ~Trapped,~ and the traditional ballad ~Hard Times (Come Again No More).~</p><p>Highlights abound. On ~Youngstown,~ Bruce evokes his trademark vibe of sepia-toned Americana, and it makes you think: It's kind of nice to have these guys in Europe, doing their thing. On balance, it's fair to say that Springsteen is one of our very best cultural ambassadors of the last several decades. Later in the show, when he digs into the nostalgic ~Glory Days,~ the feeling comes again: This is the image of America we would like to be exporting, instead of wars and oil spills and whatever bobblehead tweenage pop stars Hollywood is pushing this season.</p><p>In his jeans and work shirt (with the sleeves rolled up, of course), Springsteen sells the common-man thing like no one else. He may also be the only blue-collar guy that can wear a soul patch convincingly. Cynics sometimes point to his overall image as  shtick , but I'm not buying.</p><p>When Springsteen dons a cowboy hat for ~Outlaw Pete,~ and kneels down to relate to the crowd in a raspy voice, you remember what a surpassing storyteller and flat-out showman he is. Nice, too, that in quieter moments like these, the terrific audio brings out every nuance of the accompanying musicians (in this case, Soozie Tyrell on violin). Audio overall is superlative, and is presented in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound or PCM Stereo.</p><p>The stage setup is designed to accommodate such moments, projecting to the back seats while still providing some intimacy. The high platform main stage connects via a set of steps to a catwalk skirting the front rows. At one point, Springsteen comes down to the catwalk and gathers all the signs of song requests from the crowd.</p><p>Springsteen talks about this evolving tradition at his shows in an interview on the promotional trailer for the DVD.</p><p>~Somewhere along the line, the fans got the idea that if they brought their signs, they were going to have a higher lobbying potential to hear their songs of choice,~ he says. ~For us, it becomes like ~Stump the Band.~ It tests the E Street archives a little, you know.~</p><p>Sure enough, about halfway through the set Springsteen gathers the stack of requests and puts them on stage. As the show progresses, he grabs a song title off the stack — ~Bobby Jean~ — and cues the band by literally waving the sign at them. It adds a nice sense of spontaneity to the proceedings.</p><p>Other of Springsteen's dusty rock moves are less engaging. I understand some stage antics are so traditional there's no point in fighting them, but I feel like I've been watching Springsteen and sidekick Stevie Van Zandt share a microphone for most of my adult life. Can't we all pitch in and get Stevie his own mic?</p><p>All the other E Street regulars are on hand as well, including Nils Lofgren on guitar and Max Weinberg on drums. And of course few sounds in creation are as instantly recognizable as Clarence Clemons' saxophone.</p><p>And now, a word about sweat. According to accounts from attendees, it was a particularly warm summer evening when they filmed this show in London. Springsteen has huge circles under his arms by the middle of the second song, ~Badlands.~ By the time he's in ~Youngstown,~ halfway though the first set, he's thoroughly drenched and literally flinging perspiration with every strum. It's amazing, really. Dude is 60 years old!</p><p>Bruce isn't afraid to make the occasional joke at the expense of his veteran status, either. At one point, he pretends to collapse coming up those steps. And check out his farewell shout-out to the crowd. Which of these items is not like the others?</p><p>~London! You've just seen the heart-stopping, pants-dropping, hard-rocking, earth-shocking, booty-shaking, love-making, Viagra-taking, history-making, legendary E Street Band!~</p><p>No two ways about it; Springsteen knows how to work a crowd. In what may be the show's most powerful moment, he goes into preacher man mode, pacing the stage as he promises to build — for a couple hours at least, here in Hyde Park —~a house of hope and joy in a world of fear and despair.~ As the band vamps behind him, Revered Bruce delivers the good word: ~We're going to bring down the power of music on ya!~</p><p>It's heartening somehow to hear the power of rock so earnestly invoked, seeing as we're near 50 years past from the high tide of the 1960s. Since that moment when, as Hunter Thompson so devastatingly put it, ~the wave finally broke and rolled back.~</p><p>Well, take heart, brethren. The Boss, at least, is still doing what he can.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Glenn McDonald</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>From its bright, brittle production to its tossed-off postage stamp cover art, Working on a Dream is in every respect a companion piece to Magic, an album that's merely a set of songs, both sprawling and deliberately small, songs that don't necessarily tackle any one major theme but all add up to a portrait of their time. Magic chronicled the dog days of Bush where Working on a Dream is designed as a keynote to the Obama age, released just a week after the inauguration of the U.S.'s 44th president and not coincidentally containing not a little optimism within its 13 tracks. This sense of hope is a tonic to the despair that crept into the margins of Magic but it's easy to posit Working on a Dream as pure positivity, which isn't exactly true: a hangover from W lingers, most vividly in the broken spirit of ~The Wrestler,~ and Bruce mourning departed E Street Band member Danny Federici with ~The Last Carnival.~ Springsteen peppers his tribute with images recalling the early days of the E Street Band but saves a revival of their wild, woolly sound for the opening ~Outlaw Pete,~ a cavernous, circular, comical epic reminiscent of Springsteen's unwieldy portraits of rats on the Jersey Shore. ~Outlaw Pete~ is Working on a Dream at its best, playing like nothing less than The E Street Shuffle as reflected and refracted through Arcade Fire's naked hero worship, casually highlighting how producer Brendan O'Brien has gently nudged the Boss toward new musical avenues.</p><p>Many of these new sounds are drawn from the past, often feeling informed by Little Steven's Underground Garage -- Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren's guitars chime like the Byrds; the band knocks out a tough little blues number on ~Good Eye~; and Springsteen shows a knack for pure pop on ~Surprise, Surprise~ and indulges his ever-increasing Brian Wilson fascination on ~This Life,~ whose percolating organs and harmonies rival the High Llamas. All this rests nicely alongside the Boss' trademarks -- galloping rockers that fill a stadium (~My Lucky Day~) and their polar opposite, his intimate acoustic tunes (~Tomorrow Never Knows~) -- which all make Working on a Dream read like a rich, inventive, musical album...which it is, to an extent. The ideas and intent are there, but the album is hampered slightly by the overall modesty of Springsteen's writing -- by and large, these are small-scale songs and feel that way -- and hurt significantly by the precise, digital production that muffles the music's imagination and impact. A large part of Springsteen's appeal has always been how the E Street Band has sounded as big and open as his heart, but Working on a Dream, like Magic before it, has a production that feels tiny and constrained even as it is layered with extraneous details. It's possible to listen around this production and hear the modest charms of the songs, but the album would be better if the sound matched the sentiment.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>The Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story is a three-CD/three-DVD deluxe collection that includes a completely remastered version of the Darkness album and two more discs entitled The Promise, containing 21 unreleased songs recorded during the period.</p><p>The remastered version of the album by Bob Ludwig is sonically righteous; it resists the temptation of the era's technology to make everything sound flat. Its dynamics and warmth mirror those on the original vinyl edition. The two discs of unreleased material (available separately as well) offer an aural view as to what might have happened had Springsteen been able to record immediately after Born to Run. (He was barred from doing so for two years due to a lawsuit with his former manager.) While many lyric themes here reflect the brokenness and hard choices found on Darkness, others sound more triumphant. All of these songs contain a more maximal attitude in production. They also lack the knife-edge, searing, angry guitar work that saturates Darkness. Included are his versions of singles farmed out to other artists -- ~Because the Night~ (and while this version is terrific, it means something else in the end; Patti Smith's remains definitive) and the soulful, gritty ~Fire~ given to the Pointer Sisters. ~Gotta Get That Feeling~ summons Jack Nitzsche's production ears with its big mariachi brass. Many others openly recall Phil Spector's ~sha-na-na-na~ backing choruses. Clarence Clemons' saxophone is much more prevalent here than on Darkness. His meaty tone adds heft and groove to these songs. ~Ain't Good Enough for You~ is pure handclap, call-and-response, verse-and-chorus joy, approaching a doo wop celebration. The poignant love poetry in ~The Brokenhearted~ and ~Spanish Eyes~ could have been written by Doc Pomus, and reveals the influence of Jerry Lieber's ~Spanish Harlem.~ ~Candy's Boy~ begins lyrically in the same place as ~Candy's Room,~ but becomes a very different song. ~Racing in the Street~ contains some different words and David Lindley's violin makes the track a bit less personal, more anthemic; it's absent the shadow of doubt that makes the Darkness version so emotionally devastating. ~The Promise~ is the only cut that may have added something to Darkness that isn't already there. Its sense of bewilderment, betrayal, uncertainty, and regret is total. That said, the addition of strings draws it outside Darkness' more skeletal purview, underscoring that Darkness is perfect as it is.</p><p>The first of the three DVDs features a full-length documentary directed by Thom Zimny on the making of the album, with fantastic, amazing archival studio and performance video footage by Barry Rebo. The narration by Springsteen and interviews with producer Jon Landau, bandmembers, Patti Smith, engineer Jimmy Iovine, and even Mike Appel provide an intimate look at an intense and often frustrating period in the career of Springsteen & the E Street Band. The viewer can feel the places where confusion reigned given the sheer amount of material -- over 70 songs were written and demoed; piles of notebooks from which song lyrics and ideas were cobbled are perched everywhere. The fact that a single album came from this mountain is amazing in itself; that Darkness on the Edge of Town emerged is a miracle. The second DVD here contains a complete 2009 performance of the album at the Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park, NJ on the first half. While the performance is flawless and stirring, the lack of interaction with an audience feels a bit strange. That said, hearing Springsteen play the hell out of his guitar again, making it scream and snarl as it did during the tour for Darkness, is not only welcome, but akin to the sound of an old friend’s voice after a prolonged absence. Bob Clearmountain's mix is stellar. The band's instinctive playing is tight and intuitive. The rest of the disc features footage from the Thrill Hill Vault, including rehearsal footage, recording snippets, and some concert performances from New Jersey, New York, and Phoenix from the tour. The final DVD is a complete three-hour concert by Springsteen & the E Street Band from Houston in 1978. It’s called a “bootleg cut” on the cover for a reason; the video is fine, but the audio is basically board sound and a bit thin. That said, the performance is dynamic and riveting, and only audiophiles are gonna care -- it rocks top to bottom. This box set also includes an 80-page spiral-bound reproduction of Springsteen's notebooks documenting the album sessions, plus an original, insightful essay. It's the ultimate fetish item for hardcore fans and rock historians.</p> <p><strong>&mdash;Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>There isn't another Bruce Springsteen album like High Hopes. Cobbled together from covers -- of other songwriters along with the Boss himself (~American Skin [41 Shots]~ and ~The Ghost of Tom Joad~ are both revived) -- and outtakes from the last decade, High Hopes doesn't have the cohesion or gilded surfaces of Wrecking Ball, but neither is it quite a clearinghouse of leftovers. Inspired in part by Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who has proven to be a brother in arms to Springsteen, as well as a substitute for Steven Van Zandt in the E-Street Band, High Hopes certainly bears the proud stamp of Morello, both in its workingman's politics and in its cinematic sound. Much of this record oscillates between the moody and militant, particularly in the politically charged numbers, which are often colored by percussive guitar squalls. Here, the RATM guitarist often resembles a Nils Lofgren stripped of blues or lyricism -- think of the gusts of noise on ~Tunnel of Love~ without any melodicism -- and that's a bracing change for Springsteen, who has shown interest in atmospherics but usually when they're coming from keyboards, not six strings. Such sociological talk suggests High Hopes is nothing but rallying cries and downhearted laments, but the fascinating thing about this unkempt collection is how these protest songs and workingman's anthems are surrounded by intimate tunes, ranging from a cover of the Saints' latter-day ~Just Like Fire Would~ to a strangely soothing interpretation of Suicide's ~Dream Baby Dream.~ Morello reportedly had as much to do with the inclusion of these covers as he did with the record's set pieces -- a stirring ~The Ghost of Tom Joad,~ ~American Skin~ (which can't help but seem like a reference to the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin in this context), and ~High Hopes,~ a Tim Scott McConnell song first recorded in the '90s -- and there's a certain sober passion that ties all these songs together but, in turn, it makes the rest of the record all the more compelling because the pieces simply don't fit. There's the rousing Gaelic rock of ~This Is Your Sword,~ sounding a bit like a rejected closing credit theme for The Wire; ~Down in the Hole,~ which rides the same train-track rhythm as ~I'm on Fire;~ the complicated waltz of ~Hunter of Invisible Game,~ softer and stranger than much of the rest here; ~Harry's Place,~ a bit of synthesized Sopranos noir that sounds much older than its ten years; and the absolutely glorious ~Frankie Fell in Love,~ as open-hearted and romantic a song as Springsteen has ever written. Strictly speaking, these 12 songs don't cohere into a mood or narrative but after two decades of deliberate, purposeful albums, it's rather thrilling to hear Springsteen revel in a mess of contradictions.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Bruce Springsteen's ambition is his blessing and his curse. He's always believed that rock & roll is a music that can express people's deepest hopes and dreams and change their lives, and his best work communicates that brilliantly. But Springsteen often seems to doubt his own abilities and struggles under the weight of his own (high) standards, and many of Springsteen's best albums were painstakingly created as he spent months in the studio, searching for the right set of songs and performances that would tell the larger story in his mind. Springsteen is too smart to believe you can will a masterpiece into creation, but he does have a work ethic that suggests nothing worthwhile comes without sweat and sore muscles, and the man who regularly plays energetic three-hour shows has never hesitated to do whatever it takes to get the details just right in the studio, even if the desire is to create something that sounds explosive and spontaneous. After taking his early urban folk tales of cars and girls as far as he could on Born to Run, Springsteen took a long, hard look at the lives of those same kids, now saddled with adult responsibilities and realizing that the American Dream was increasingly out of their grasp, on 1978's Darkness on the Edge of Town.</p> <p>With 1980's The River, Springsteen sought to expand on those themes while also offering more of the tough, bar-band rock that was his trademark (and often conspicuous in its absence on Darkness), and by the time it was released it had swelled into Springsteen's first two-LP set. After presenting his fans with a grand-scale study of how Darkness on the Edge of Town came into being on the 2010 box set The Promise, Springsteen does the same for The River with The Ties That Bind: The River Collection, which features a newly remastered edition of the original album along with a bonus disc of outtakes (most previously unreleased) and an early single-LP version of the album that Springsteen opted not to release because it failed to tell the story he had envisioned. The short version sounds like the rough draft that it is, though it also includes several songs that didn't appear on the longer final version (~Loose Ends~ and ~To Be True~ in particular are superb songs that simply didn't fit the flow of the album), as well as different versions of a few tracks that do (~The Ties That Bind~ contains different lyrics, while ~Stolen Car~ and ~You Can Look [But You Better Not Touch]~ feature different arrangements). And the outtakes disc offers 22 variations on the album's themes that point to any number of directions the album could have gone, and if nothing else it says a great deal about Springsteen that he had enough good songs that numbers as strong as ~Party Lights,~ ~Roulette,~ ~Where the Bands Are,~ and ~Chain Lightning~ could end up on the shelf.</p> <p>The Ties That Bind also includes a documentary (on DVD or Blu-ray) on the making of the album, as well as a full concert filmed in 1980 that finds Springsteen & the E Street Band in incendiary form. The Ties That Bind: The River Collection, like a high-profile DVD release of the 2000s, is more about the bonus features than the main feature, but the extras lend an invaluable perspective to one of the most important works in Springsteen's catalog, and this set makes it possible to imagine the many chapters that could have been added or removed from the album while still telling the same powerful story, as well as documenting the thought and effort Springsteen put into the process.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Amazon.com</strong></p><hr/><p>'The Ties That Bind: The River Collection' is a comprehensive look at Bruce Springsteen's 'The River' era, one of the most pivotal periods of time in his career. The set contains 52 tracks on 4 CDs with a wealth of unreleased material, and 4 hours of never-before-seen video on 3 DVDs. It is comprised of the original 'The River' double album as released in 1980; the first official release of 'The River: Single Album;' a CD of 1979/80 studio outtakes; a two-DVD film of never-released, newly edited multi-camera footage from Springsteen's famed 1980 show in Tempe, AZ, long rumored but never-before-seen; rare tour rehearsal footage; a brand new documentary ~The Ties That Bind~ about 'The River;' and a coffee table book of 200 rare or previously unseen photos and memorabilia with a new essay by Mikal Gilmore. </p><p>'The River,' was originally released on October 17, 1980 as a double album and reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. 'The River: Single Album' is the 10-track album that Springsteen recorded in 1979 as a follow up to 1978's 'Darkness On The Edge Of Town' but never released. The fourth CD on the box set is 'The River: Outtakes,' which spans the entire 'The River' sessions in 1979 and 1980. Eleven songs are rarities that have never been released before, and for the most part are completely unheard and unknown even to fans, who have long considered Springsteen's outtakes to be treasured secrets. </p><p>~The Ties That Bind,~ on one DVD, is a brand new 60-minute documentary that features an intimate interview with Springsteen as he reflects on the tumultuous, extended period writing and recording 'The River.' The film transitions between Springsteen telling the stories behind the music and illustrating them with solo acoustic guitar performances -- interspersed with period concert footage and rare photos of Bruce and the band in and out of the studio. The final video component is ~Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band: The River Tour, Tempe 1980,~ a new film produced from footage professionally filmed in 1980 using four cameras and recorded in multitrack audio. The film features 24 songs 2 hours, 40 minutes on 2 DVDs from Springsteen s November 5, 1980 concert at Arizona State University in Tempe, AZ. Widely regarded as one of Springsteen s finest performances, this intense show features early live versions of over half of 'The River' songs. Also included is 20 minutes of footage from the late September, 1980 River Tour rehearsals held in Lititz, PA, showing Springsteen and The E Street Band working through live arrangements of what was then unreleased material from the upcoming album.</p><p>~The Ties That Bind: The River Collection is packaged in a 10~ x 12~ box with a hardcover 148-page coffee table book containing 200 studio and live photographs most of which have never been seen before plus pages from Springsteen's notebooks, single covers, images and outtakes from the original album package, and other memorabilia documenting the album. Liner notes include a new essay from journalist Mikal Gilmore, the original Rolling Stone album review from 1980, and Springsteen's updated comments about the album from the 1998 ~Songs~ book.</p><hr/><p>The River doesn't flow—it floods. Bruce Springsteen's fifth album gushes forth with the fury of a burst dam, delivering torrents of despair, inspiration, heartbreak, and joy. Coming after the deliberate twin masterpieces of Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town, records epic in scope but precise in execution, The River not only appears to be a mess but embodies the classic definition of a double album: it seems to be a clearinghouse for every song Bruce Springsteen had at the ready in 1980. The Ties That Bind: The River Collection shows just how wrong that assumption is. Expanding the original 20-song double album to a 4xCD set supplemented with video, it laughs at the notion that the original album was much too much by underscoring exactly how Springsteen intended the album to overwhelm.</p><p>Initially, Springsteen planned to follow 1978's Darkness on the Edge of Town with an album called The Ties That Bind but he withdrew the record in the fall of 1979, believing that it wasn't ~big enough.~ This claim came from the stage during a 2009 performance of The River at Madison Square Garden, with Bruce going on to say, ~I wanted to capture the themes that I'd been writing about on Darkness. I wanted to keep those characters with me and at the same time added the music that made our live shows so much fun and enjoyable for our audience.~ On this box, the scrapped The Ties That Bind gets an official airing as the third disc on the set—here it's dubbed The River [Single Album]—and it does indeed play like a truncated, miniature version of The River, containing in its 10 tracks seven of the double-album's songs, along with two alternate versions of tunes that wound up on the released record. What's striking is what's absent: shorn of its party songs, the record feels gloomy and haunted—even ~You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)~ in a lonesome Sun rockabilly incarnation feels like a transmission from the lonely black of night. It reiterates many of the themes of Darkness, only without aggression, fury, or precision, the very things that give that record a lift that fights against its undercurrents of hopelessness.</p><p>Surely recognizing this deficit, Springsteen spent roughly another year in the studio, reviving old songs and writing new ones, arriving at full-blown, completed recordings of most of these tunes, then picking and choosing from his surplus to create the final album. The result was enough material for another double album, presented here as The Ties That Bind, a collection that runs two songs longer the 1980 double-LP but winds up six minutes shorter. This is an absurd amount of shelved material—and, even with this abundance, there are a handful of bootlegged cuts that didn't make the grade. There's a lot of unheard music here, even if some tracks are colored with new Bruce vocals, a slightly sour grace-note that is only notable upon close inspection.</p><p>Listening through the box, it's hard not to be struck by Springsteen's labor-intensive creative method. He knew the broad outline of what he wanted to achieve, so he kept tweaking his material in the studio, rearranging and recording until he found just the right emotion. If The Cutting Edge 1965–1966 proves how Bob Dylan sought to capture the lightning of a live performance, Springsteen always is seduced by the illusion of a record: sure, he's invigorated by live performance—and the Tempe concert included here is tremendous, the E-Street Band at the peak of their power—but he sculpts his albums out of tracks that are powerful as recordings, not simply songs.</p><p>This is especially true of The River, which Bruce loaded up with the purest, hardest, and happiest rock'n'roll the E-Street Band ever cut in the studio. ~She's the One~ pulsated to a beat borrowed from Bo Diddley and Darkness surged with desperate passion, but Bruce's first four records rarely touched on the ecstatic joy that can be had from just making noise. The River is full of these moments (~Sherry Darling~, ~Crush on You~, ~I'm a Rocker~, ~Cadillac Ranch~), and some of the weightier items trade in this same sense of exuberance—a sense of desperation cuts against the grain of the sunny hook on ~Hungry Heart~, and ~Two Hearts~ spins headfirst into unfettered romanticism. But this music is so simple, so visceral, that it's often been tagged as throwaway, the detritus surrounding the haunting ~The River~, ~The Price You Pay~, and ~Stolen Car~.</p><p>Thing is, these throwaways give The River its cinematic scope. Some of the newer additions were cut from a familiar forlorn cloth (~Independence Day~, the closing pair of ~Drive All Night~ and ~Wreck on the Highway~) while ~Point Blank~ and ~Jackson Cage~ split the difference between the celebration and sorrow. But the biggest distinction between The River and the original Ties That Bind is this full-on bash, funny and furious and entirely sincere in its worship of the sounds rocking frat houses and AM radio in a '60s that didn't belong to the Beatles. It's the Springsteen album that can easily slip onto any show on Little Steven's Underground Garage, and this party winds up providing an ideal counterpoint to the sweeter, sadder moments on The River.</p><p>Take the second side, which opens with ~Hungry Heart~—Bruce's first genuine hit single, reaching number five on a combination of its hook and Springsteen's general momentum—then dwells upon the cinematic escape ~Out in the Street~ and serves up two breakneck rockers before settling into the dreaminess of ~I Wanna Marry You~ and the stark ~The River~, the latter two hitting harder due to the companions. Each side is structured similarly, with the last song tipping slightly toward melancholy, the cumulative effect suggesting there's no separating pleasure from the pain. It all comes at once and, depending on mood, The River either seems like the happiest or saddest of Bruce's records: in its mess lies a mirror that reflects the listener's state of mind.</p><p>The Ties That Bind illustrates this sprawl was no accident. Within these 22 rejects—some of them sneaking out as B-sides or on previous reissues, including the 1998 box Tracks and the bonus disc on 2003's The Essential Bruce Springsteen—Springsteen explores the same terrain as he does on The River: urban romance, accidental violence, working-man's blues, and restless nights. Like its parent, The Ties That Bind achieves a delicate balance between adult despair and adolescent freedom: he may dwell upon ~Little White Lies~ and ~The Time That Never Was~, but he also borrows a song title from Claudine Clark (~Party Lights~) and tips a hat to Connie Francis' beach classic Where the Boys Are (~Where the Bands Are~). Enough great songs didn't make a cut that it's possible to cobble together a killer single album from the outtakes—one that would open with the breathless ~Meet Me in the City~ and contain the cloistered paranoia of ~The Man Who Got Away~, the blank desperation of ~Roulette~, the open-hearted ~Ricky Wants a Man of Her Own~ and ~From Small (Big Things One Day Come)~, a heightened Chuck Berry story song Bruce turned over to Dave Edmunds. But like the completed album, what resonates is the magnitude of the sprawl itself.</p><p>As they spill out, the songs play off each other, accentuating the sorrow or celebration heard in their predecessors. Combing through these outtakes, it quickly becomes clear how Springsteen, Van Zandt, and Jon Landau constructed each track to deliver its own specific visceral thrill and then culled through their finished product to find the cuts that fit their intended design. Some of these rejects rely on that headstrong old time rock'n'roll—~Living on the Edge of the World~ bops along to its syncopated swing, ~Paradise by the C~ is a roadhouse jam highlighting Clarence Clemons—but others play like ripostes to the E-Street Band's peers: the live ~Held Up Without a Gun~ (which would later morph into the finished ~You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)~) careens like Elvis Costello & the Attractions, the chiming guitars of ~Take 'Em As They Come~ seem like an answer to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, while ~I Wanna Be With You~ pulses to the Iron City rush of Joe Grushecky & the Houserockers.</p><p>Thirty-five years after the release of The River, it's easy to think of Bruce Springsteen as existing on a separate plane from such contemporary kindred spirits or perhaps as somebody who only belongs to part of a self-styled lineage that runs through Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan. By adding The Times That Bind, both the scrapped '79 LP and this new double-disc collection of outtakes, to The River, this box highlights the plain, prosaic ways he belonged to his time. On these 52 songs, Springsteen sings about gas shortages, cold beer, unemployment agencies, busted dreams, and Burt Reynolds, fleeting images of a blue collar America that unknowingly was entering its decay but these words are married to the sound of a working band that knows it has to work, aware that it has to have songs to fuel those marathon three hour shows.</p><p>Springsteen never really let these straight-up rockers be part of his records again—maybe on Born in the U.S.A., but both ~Darlington County~ and ~Working on the Highway~ end in tears—but he also never quite worked the same way again, producing such a ridiculous surplus of finished material as he set out on his quest for bigger, greater things. The River brought Bruce to those heights, giving him his first number one album and Top 10 single, but it's hard not to think of it as not a beginning but an end, the last record where he and the E-Street Band were not the biggest band in the land but merely the best. In that light, piling on a ton of unreleased music, all in the same spirit and feel as the final album and nearly as good as what made the cut, feels like a gift. And for those who may think four CDs and three DVDs are too much, consider this: for an album that is all about contradictions, excess and mess, more of everything is most certainly a good thing.</p><hr/>When Bruce Springsteen released The Promise back in 2010, it was a document of what could have been. Although most of the album's songs were recorded during the same sessions that birthed Darkness On the Edge of Town, they contrasted wildly in tone — where Darkness was steeped in working class angst, The Promise had a more romantic outlook. Its arrangements were lusher and its characters found easier escape from their blue-collar confinements, their gazes turned upward to the stars instead of towards the factories pumping out smog below. Even the handful of tunes that popped up on both records received dramatically different treatments. Most notably, The Promise‘s version of ~Racing In the Street~ touted a higher key and jaunty fiddle from David Lindley, both of which made it more uplifting than the more funereal original. Likewise, ~Factory~ was turned from a dour going-to-work song into a more hopeful getting-off-work song.When compiling the final product, Springsteen had a wealth of material to choose from, and for one reason or another — perhaps because he was getting older and had already pushed romanticism to its limit on Born To Run — he chose to explore the shadows. It's no mistake that the title of Darkness On the Edge of Town sounds so much more foreboding than The Promise. It's no mistake that its songs are, for the most part, heavier and more bitter.The Ties That Bind has a similar background. Well, almost. Originally submitted to Columbia Records as a single disc of 10 songs, it got expanded to a whopping 20 after The Boss decided he wanted the album to have more depth and variety. Thus, The River was born, a heartland rock buffet with everything from humorous bar jams (~Cadillac Ranch~, ~I'm a Rocker~, ~Ramrod~) to soul-crushing folk ballads (~Independence Day~, ~Drive All Night~, the title track) on the menu. What's more is that, even as an 83-minute double album, The River had more than twice as many songs that didn't make the cut.And that's where The Ties That Bind starts to differ from The Promise, despite them both being companion pieces to already existing albums. Since Springsteen and The E Street Band plowed through the former's sessions with a singular aesthetic in mind (American realism where the stakes range from trivial to life-threatening) as opposed to two different sides of the same coin, the collection doesn't feel like a bizarro version of The River as much as an extension of it. A title like …And Now, More of The River would have been just as appropriate.Fortunately, The River — and thus The Ties That Bind — happens to be a damn near perfect album. This was in Springsteen's heyday of sketching crucially unremarkable (i.e., realistic) characters to explore themes larger than themselves (and, for a time, himself), not the other way around. ~Stolen Car~ does indeed feature a car thief, but it's really about marital entropy. On The Ties That Bind, several of the River outtakes function as its sister songs, also doling out loss through low-level criminal activity: The most obvious is a more boardwalk-friendly ~Stolen Car~ (Danny Federici steps out front-and-center with his accordion) before both ~The Man Who Got Away~ and ~Roulette~ open on a turd on the run — one who's flying solo and another who's been forced to take his wife and kids with him. There are also everyday Joes and Janes who get caught up in crime even when they're not looking for it, such as the guy who sees his girlfriend gunned down by gang crossfire in ~Stray Bullet~. As over-the-top as that sounds, the band keeps pulp at bay with Steven Van Zandt‘s ripped-open background falsetto and a rare bit of soprano sax from Clarence Clemons.Of course, The River isn't solely about criminals and neither is its single-disc counterpart or its mammoth compilation of outtakes. And since all three of them are included here in order — The River on discs one and two, The Ties That Bind on disc three, then all of the outtakes (first the unreleased ones, then those already heard on 1998's Tracks box set and various singles) on disc four — you can continue playing the mirror game with all of the varying subject matter and musical formats. Weekend warriors get their due in ~Out In the Street~ (The River), ~Cindy~ (The Ties That Bind), and the fret-jumping lead single ~Meet Me In the City~ (the outtakes). Elsewhere, E Street flaunts its bar band cred in the dispensable but fun as hell ~Sherry Darling~ (The River), ~Chain Lightning~, and ~Paradise By the ~C~~ (both on the outtakes), all of them shaken loose by group vocals, handclaps, and beer-soaked chatter. And since every last bit of music — serious and silly alike — places the same high currency on hooks and furious meat-and-potatoes rock, you could pick any 10 songs out of the box set's 52 and have one hell of an LP. Even Springsteen himself has confessed he's not sure why something as pummeling as ~Roulette~ was scrapped in favor of a throwaway track like ~Crush On You~. The River Collection isn't a glimpse of what could have been — it's raw proof that The River sessions produced too many good songs for one album (even a double album) to contain.<p>&mdash;<strong>Dan Caffrey</strong></p>"

After an unsuccessful single on Decca, ~The Elf~ (which featured Jimmy Page on guitar), Stewart signed with CBS and, beginning in 1967, released a series of albums largely consisting of introspective, confessional love songs. <i>Love Chronicles</i> was the only one to be released in the U.S., and the autobiographical title track, which detailed Stewart's romantic involvements, attracted a bit of attention for the singer's use of the word ~f*cking~ in a song with supposed artistic credibility. On 1974's <i>Past, Present and Future</i>, Stewart switched gears, exploring his fascination with historical tales, and was rewarded with his first U.S. chart album. <i>Modern Times</i> was even more successful, and <i>Year of the Cat</i> was an unqualified hit, selling over a million copies and spawning the Top Ten title single. Time Passages duplicated both feats, but Stewart's creativity dried up soon afterward, and difficulties over his contract and change of labels prevented him from releasing any new material until 1984. <i>Russians and Americans</i> was highly political, but sales were disappointing. Even so, Stewart recorded and toured sporadically in the late '80s and '90s while devoting time to his hobby of wine collecting.</p>&mdash;<b>Steve Huey</b> ",

He then perfected it all on 1976's <i>Year of the Cat</i>, arguably his masterpiece. There is no overarching theme here, as there was on its two immediate predecessors, but the impossible lushness of Alan Parsons' production and Stewart's evocative continental narratives give the record a welcome feeling of cohesion that keeps the record enchanting as it moves from ~Lord Grenville~ to ~Midas Shadow~ to ~Broadway Hotel,~ before it ends with the haunting title track. Along the way, Stewart doesn't dwell too deeply in any area, preferring to trace out mysteries with his evocative lyrical imagery and a spinning array of self-consciously sophisticated music, songs that evoke American and European folk and pop with a deliberate grace. This could be unbearably precious if it didn't work so well. Stewart is detached from his music, but only in the sense that he gives this album a stylish elegance, and Parsons is his perfect foil, giving the music a rich, panoramic sweep that mimics Stewart's globe-trotting songs. The result is a tremendous example of how good self-conscious progressive pop can be, given the right producer and songwriter -- and if you're a fan of either prog or pop and haven't given Al Stewart much thought, prepare to be enchanted.</p>&mdash;<b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"name": "Stephen Stills",
		"biography": "<p>Famed for his work in Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills & Nash, two of pop music's most successful and enduring groups, Stephen Stills was born in Dallas, Texas, on January 3, 1945. He became fascinated by music at a young age, and by the age of 15 was playing professionally. He eventually dropped out of college to move to New York City to try his hand as a folk performer before signing on as a guitar player with the Au Go-Go Singers, where he befriended a fellow bandmate named Richie Furay.</p><p>After a tour of Canada (during which they headlined a bill with the Squires, which featured guitarist Neil Young), Stills left the Au Go-Gos in 1965 for Los Angeles, where he became enmeshed in the city's burgeoning folk-rock community. After a series of session gigs and auditions (including one for the TV series The Monkees), in the spring of 1966 Stills enlisted Young, Furay, bassist Bruce Palmer, and drummer Dewey Martin to form the Herd, later dubbed the Buffalo Springfield. A year later, the group issued their eponymous debut; its Stills-penned single ~For What It's Worth,~ made them stars. Internal problems, ego clashes, and drugs were already tearing the band apart, however, and by the release of 1968's Last Time Around, the Springfield had already dissolved.</p><p>Stills quickly resurfaced with 1968's Super Session, recorded with fellow guitarists Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper. A jam session with ex-Byrd David Crosby and former Hollies member Graham Nash led to the formation of the vocal harmony supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash; released in 1969, their self-titled debut was hugely successful, propelled by the single ~Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,~ written by Stills for folksinger Judy Collins. Later that year, Neil Young joined the loose-knit group, and in 1970, as Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, they issued Déjà Vu, another major hit.</p><p>From its inception, CSNY was designed to allow the individual performers great latitude for their solo work, and following the recording of the group's live LP Four Way Street, in late 1970 Stills released his self-titled solo debut. Sparked by the success of the hit single ~Love the One You're With,~ the album, which featured cameos from Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton, was another smash, as was his 1971 follow-up Stephen Stills 2. In 1972, Stills began performing with a new backing unit, Manassas, which featured ex-Byrd and Flying Burrito Brother Chris Hillman; both their eponymous debut and 1973's Down the Road continued Stills' long string of chart successes.</p><p>In 1975, he celebrated his signing to Columbia with Stills, followed a year later by Illegal Stills. In the summer of 1976, he planned to tour with Neil Young; however, Young was hampered with throat problems, so Stills took to the road alone, although he and Young did team for the LP Long May You Run. In 1977, Stills reunited with Crosby and Nash for CSN, which sold over four million copies; the following summer, the trio mounted an acoustic tour, and Stills issued the solo record Thoroughfare Gap. CSN continued their reunion throughout the early years of the next decade, teaming in 1980 for Replay and in 1982 for Daylight Again, which featured the hits ~Southern Cross~ and ~Wasted on the Way.~</p>Following 1983's live CSN effort Allies, Stills again went solo for 1984's Right by You. In 1985, Crosby was sent to prison on drug possession charges, and Stills spent much of the late '80s out of the public eye. Following Crosby's release, in 1988 the reconstituted Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young recorded American Dream, followed in 1990 by the CSN release Live It Up. In 1991, Stills issued the solo LP Stills Alone, while CSN's After the Storm appeared in 1994. Stills, Young, and Furay finally reunited as Buffalo Springfield for a pair of shows at Young's annual Bridge School Benefit in the fall of 2010. It wasn't a complete reunion, since bassist Bruce Palmer had died in 2004 and drummer Dewey Martin passed in 2009, but the three singers used drummer Joe Vitale and bassist Rick Rosas to fill in. The same configuration played six concerts in the spring of 2011 but reportedly did no studio work. <p>&mdash;<strong>Jason Ankeny</strong></p>",

But when he misses the mark, as on ~Ecology Song,~ he misses it by a mile and then some. Besides that cut, ~Bluebird Revisited~ is pure self-indulgence that someone of his craft and technique should have known better than to include here -- or anywhere. But with CD players, one can omit anything offending and concentrate on what's good about Stephen Stills 2. Cut the disc in half, and you have a very enjoyable listening experience.

				"review": "<p>Talk about understatement -- there's Stephen Stills on the cover, acoustic guitar in hand, promising a personal singer/songwriter-type statement. And there is some of that -- even a lot of that personal music-making -- on Stephen Stills, but it's all couched in astonishingly bold musical terms. Stephen Stills is top-heavy with 1970 sensibilities, to be sure, from the dedication to the memory of Jimi Hendrix to the now piggish-seeming message of ~Love the One You're With.~ Yet, listening to this album three decades on, it's still a jaw-dropping experience, the musical equal to Crosby, Stills & Nash or Déjà Vu, and only a shade less important than either of them. The mix of folk, blues (acoustic and electric), hard rock, and gospel is seamless, and the musicianship and the singing are all so there, in your face, that it just burns your brain (in the nicest, most benevolent possible way) even decades later. Recorded amid the breakup of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Stills' first solo album was his effort to put together his own sound and, not surprisingly, it's similar to a lot of stuff on the group's two albums. But it's also infinitely more personal, as well as harder and bluesier in many key spots; yet, it's every bit as soft and as lyrical as the group in other spots, and all laced with a degree of yearning and urgency that far outstrips virtually anything he did with the group. ~Love the One You're With,~ which started life as a phrase that Stills borrowed from Billy Preston at a party, is the song from this album that everybody knows, but it's actually one of the lesser cuts here -- not much more than a riff and an upbeat lyric and mood, albeit all of it infectious. ~Do for the Others,~ by contrast, is one of the prettiest and most moving pieces of music that Stills has ever been associated with, and ~Church (Part of Someone)~ showed him moving toward gospel and R&B (and good at it, too); and then there's ~Old Times Good Times,~ musically as good a rock song as Stills has ever recorded (even if it borrows a bit from ~Pre-Road Downs~), and featuring Jimi Hendrix on lead guitar. ~Go Back Home~ (which has Eric Clapton on guitar) is fine a piece of bluesy hard rock, while ~Sit Yourself Down~ features superb singing by Stills and a six-person backing chorus (that includes Cass Elliot, Graham Nash, and David Crosby) around a great tune. ~To a Flame~ is downright ethereal, while the live ~Black Queen~ is a superb piece of acoustic blues. All of this is presented by Stills in the best singing voice of his career up to that point, bolder, more outgoing, and more powerful (a result of his contact with Doris Troy) than anything in his previous output. He also plays lots of instruments (à la Crosby, Stills & Nash, which is another reason it sounds so similar to the group in certain ways), though a bit more organ than guitar, thanks to the presence of Hendrix and Clapton on two cuts. If the album has a flaw, it's the finale, ~We Are Not Helpless,~ which slightly overstays its welcome. But hey, this was still the late '60s, and excess was the rule, not the exception, and it's such modest excess.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

It is credited to ~The Stills-Young Band,~ which is to say, Stephen Stills and his band with Young added, and the two divide up the songwriting and lead vocals, five for Young, four for Stills. The pairing, though it proved short-lived and had, in fact, ended before this album was released, must have seemed commercially logical. Like Young, Stills had seen his record sales decline after a successful period following the 1970 breakup of CSNY. So had erstwhile partners David Crosby and Graham Nash, but they had returned to Top Ten, gold-selling status in the fall of 1975 with their Wind on the Water duo album. Why couldn't Stills and Young do the same thing? Maybe they could have (and, actually, this was the first gold album for either in two years) if they had made a better record together. Young's songs were pleasant newly written throwaways with the exception of the title track, a trunk song he had written as a tribute to an old car. Stills' compositions seemed more seriously intended, but still were not substantial. The playing, largely handled by the professional sessionman types in Stills' band, was far smoother than what one was accustomed to in a Young album. The result was a listenable record, but not a compelling one, and thus well below Young's usual standard and Stills' best.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

		"biography": "<p>After disbanding the Police at the peak of their popularity in 1984, Sting quickly established himself as a viable solo artist, one obsessed with expanding the boundaries of pop music. Sting incorporated heavy elements of jazz, classical, and worldbeat into his music, writing lyrics that were literate and self-consciously meaningful, and he was never afraid to emphasize this fact in the press. For such unabashed ambition, he was equally loved and reviled, with supporters believing that he was at the forefront of literate, intelligent rock and his critics finding his entire body of work pompous. Either way, Sting remained one of pop's biggest superstars for the first ten years of his solo career, before his record sales began to slip.</p><p>Before the Police were officially disbanded, Sting began work on his first solo album late in 1984, rounding up a group of jazz musicians as a supporting band. Moving from bass to guitar, he recorded his solo debut, 1985's The Dream of the Blue Turtles, with Branford Marsalis, Kenny Kirkland, and Omar Hakim. The move wasn't entirely unexpected, since Sting had played with jazz and progressive rock bands in his youth, but the result was considerably more mature and diverse than any Police record. The album became a hit, with ~If You Love Somebody Set Them Free,~ ~Love Is the Seventh Wave,~ and ~Fortress Around Your Heart~ reaching the American Top Ten. Sting brought the band out on an extensive tour, which was captured on a documentary called Bring on the Night, which appeared in 1986, along with a live double album of the same name. That year, Sting participated in a half-hearted Police reunion that resulted in only one new song, a re-recorded version of ~Don't Stand So Close to Me.~</p><p>Following the aborted Police reunion, Sting began working on the ambitious Nothing Like the Sun, which was dedicated to his recently deceased mother. Working from a jazz foundation, and again collaborating with Marsalis, Sting worked with a number of different musicians on the album, including Gil Evans and former Police guitarist Andy Summers. The album received generally positive reviews upon its release in late 1987, and it generated hit singles with ~We'll Be Together~ and ~They Dance Alone.~ Following its release, Sting began actively campaigning for Amnesty International and environmentalism, establishing the Rainforest Foundation, which was designed to raise awareness about preserving the Brazilian rainforest. An abridged Spanish version of Nothing Like the Sun, Nada Como el Sol, was released in 1988.</p><p>Sting took several years to deliver the follow-up to Nothing Like the Sun, during which time he appeared in a failed Broadway revival of The Threepenny Opera in 1989. His father also died, which inspired 1991's The Soul Cages, a dense, dark, and complex album. Although the album peaked at number two and spawned the Top Ten hit ~All This Time,~ the record was less successful than its predecessor. Two years later, he delivered Ten Summoner's Tales, a light, pop-oriented record that became a hit on the strength of two Top 20 singles, ~If I Ever Lose My Faith in You~ and ~Fields of Gold.~ At the end of 1993, ~All for Love,~ a song he recorded with Rod Stewart and Bryan Adams for The Three Musketeers, became a number one hit. The single confirmed that Sting's audience had shifted from new wave/college rock fans to adult contemporary, and the 1994 compilation Fields of Gold: The Best of Sting played to that audience.</p><p>Three years after Ten Summoner's Tales, Sting released Mercury Falling in the spring of 1996. Although the album debuted highly, it quickly fell down the charts, stalling at platinum sales and failing to generate a hit single. While the album failed, Sting remained a popular concert attraction, confirming his immense popularity. Brand New Day, which followed in 1999, turned his commercial fortunes around in a big way, and 2003's Sacred Love did well also.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b> ",

				"review": "<p>Sting really got carried away with the idea that his supporting crew for Dream of the Blue Turtles was a real jazz band, and technically, he was kind of right. He did pluck them straight out of Wynton Marsalis' backing band (thereby angering Wynton and emboldening his anti-rock stance, while flaring up a sibling rivalry between the trumpeter and his saxophonist brother Branford -- a veritable hat trick, that), and since he was initially a jazz bassist, it seemed like a good fit. At the very least, it seemed like a monumental occasion because he documented the entire development of the band and the making of Dream with a documentary called Bring on the Night, releasing a double-live album as its soundtrack just a year after the debut hit the stores. This could be called hubris (and so it appears to be), especially because the appearance of the live album feels like a way of showcasing Sting's jazz band and jazz chops. Most of the songs run around five minutes and there are no less than three melodies, two of which marry an old Police number with a tune from Dream. Arriving as a second solo album, it can't help but feel a little unnecessary, even if the loose, rather infectious performances show what Sting was trying to achieve with his debut. Even so, this is a record for the cult, and while it will satisfy them, to others it will seem like, well, hubris.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<p>Emboldened by the enthusiastic response to the muted Nothing Like the Sun and reeling from the loss of his parents, Sting constructed The Soul Cages as a hushed mediation on mortality, loss, grief, and father/son relationships (the album is dedicated, in part, to his father; its predecessor was dedicated to his mother). Using the same basic band as Nothing Like the Sun, the album has the same supple, luxurious tone, stretching out leisurely over nine tracks, almost all of them layered mid-tempo tunes (the exception being grinding guitars of the title track). Within this setting, Sting hits a few remarkable peaks, such as the elegant waltz ~Mad About You~ and ~All This Time,~ a deceptively skipping pop tune that hides a moving tribute to his father. If the entirety of The Soul Cages was as nimbly melodic and urgently emotional as these two cuts, it would have been a quiet masterpiece. Instead, it turns inward -- not just lyrically, but musically -- and plays as a diary entry, perhaps interesting to those willing to spend hours immersing themselves within Sting's loss, finding parallels within their own life. This may be too much effort for anyone outside of the devoted, since apart from those two singles (and perhaps ~Why Should I Cry for You~), there are few entry points into The Soul Cages -- and, once you get in there, it only rewards if your emotional state mirrors Sting's.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<p>Reason number 872 why I hate REM: their arrogance. Back in 1995 as the band geared up for their ~Monster~ tour, bassist Mike Mills spoke to ~Rolling Stone~ magazine about the upcoming trek, the band's first in five years. He commented upon how important it is for bands to play live. To paraphrase, he related how the Police were a tight little post-punk act in their early days, but once they became an ~art project~ and stopped touring, they became useless and irrelevant.<p><p>Even after five years, I still find Mills' hypocrisy to be stunning. First of all, though ~Monster~ marked a return to harder-edged guitar rock, over the couple of albums prior to that release, REM had largely indulged in the kind of ~artsy~ experimentation for which he condemned the Police. During that period, REM did not tour; before 1994's ~Monster~, their last outing occurred in support of 1988's ~Green~, though that trek didn't happen until 1990.<p><p>Not only was Mills a hypocrite, but he was wrong. Despite his allegations to the contrary, the Police never became a ~studio-only~ outfit. Yes, their albums became more and more complex, but they still supported each one with extensive tours, through and including their hugely-successful swansong, 1983's ~Synchronicity~.<p><p>Even after the band split and Sting went off on his own, the consistent touring continued. As a matter of fact, Sting has played in support of each of his six solo albums, beginning with 1985's ~The Dream of the Blue Turtles~ up through 1999's ~Brand New Day~. REM can't even tour behind two albums in a row, much less the eleven straight backed by Sting (with and without the Police)!<p><p>Unfortunately, not all is positive in relation to Sting's live performances. I've seen him on each tour since the 1981/1982 outing behind ~Ghost in the Machine~ and I'm afraid his live shows have definitely declined over the years. I can't offer many comments about the January 1982 Police gig I saw because I was too inexperienced; it was only the third show I'd ever seen. I had a few more under my belt by the August 1983 concert, which I found to be pretty solid, and was much more experienced by the occasion of the August 1985 solo performance I witnessed.<p><p>In my opinion, Sting's first solo tour remains the pinnacle for his career on his own. It all seemed fresh and exciting, and he was backed with a tremendously solid band. Branford Marsalis provided a fine onstage foil for the boss, and entire ensemble created an energy that made the shows sizzle.<p><p>For the most part, a similar power inhabited Sting's 1988 shows in support of 1987's ~.Nothing Like the Sun~, though they weren't quite as strong as the 1985 gigs. Marsalis and some other musicians carried over from the earlier band, but a fair number of changes occurred. Nonetheless, the energy level remained high and the concerts were quite solid.<p><p>Unfortunately, Sting's shows in the Nineties weren't as entertaining. His 1991 tour found him with a completely-revamped band and a much more bland presentation. Instead of Marsalis, Sting's main partner on stage now became guitarist Dominic Miller. (Sting played guitar on his two prior solo tours and returned to the bass on this outing.) Miller's technically proficient and an able musician, but he has absolutely no personality whatsoever, and none of the other band members did anything to spark the proceedings either.<p><p>As such, the 1991 shows were musically-competent but generally somewhat lifeless affairs, and the three tours Sting has mounted since - 1993/94, 1996, and 1999/2000 - have all been virtual clones of that presentation. Miller continues as his guitarist - he's the only carryover from the 1991 band - and the shows remain listenable but fairly dull.<p><p>In a way, Sting's albums have followed the same pattern. While with the Police, each of their five albums seemed different; their sound slowly evolved from record to record, and though they all feel like the work of the same band, there are few songs that could easily be transplanted from one album to another. That trend continued during his first two solo records, though the differences seemed more subtle.<p><p>And then - bam! Sting hit a wall. If you examine his four albums from the Nineties, they're virtually interchangeable. He latched onto a fairly gentle VH1-ready sound he liked and has done little to deviate from that tone since then. Yes, he presents a fair number of stylistic changes within each work, from pop to country to jazz, but the results all still seem fairly even, and one could easily take pretty much any song off of, say, ~Brand New Day~ and drop it on one of the others and no one would notice the difference.<p><p>Don't get me wrong - I still enjoy Sting's work. However, I fail to generate much enthusiasm for it. His music has become too generic for my liking, and it lacks many distinctive qualities. The workmanship seems solid but the inspiration fails to appear.<p><p>On the DVD of Sting: The Brand New Day Tour Live at the Universal Ampitheatre, we find an October 1999 representation of his current act. I saw him live in June 2000, and I thought the DVD portrayed what I witnessed fairly effectively, though Sting seemed more lively during the Universal show. No, he doesn't do a whole lot, but he showed a little spark and energy that he lacked when I saw him locally.<p><p>This still doesn't make the concert rival the shows he put on in the Eighties, and I doubt he'll ever go anywhere with drowsy Miller in his band. To be fair, there's not a lot of energy coming from any part of Sting's group; they all seem like competent but disinterested participants. Actually, I can't recall the last time I saw a group of musicians who appeared so completely uninvolved with each other. Usually different folks interact, but that rarely occurs here; it's as though each of them resided in their own little sound booth and they can't have any active dealings with the others.<p><p>Actually, this tendency makes the show more entertaining as home video viewing than as a live performance. Frankly, I found much of the concert to be boring when I took it in live last summer. Granted, it didn't help that I'd just seen three Springsteen shows and two Bowie performances the week prior to Sting's concert; since Bowie and Bruce are easily the two best live performers I've even seen, it was hard for me to adjust to anyone less talented.<p><p>Even without that factor, however, I still wouldn't have thought much of Sting's show just because I like to have some sort of visual stimulation when I watch a concert. The stage is a very simply affair, and the lighting tends toward light reds, blues and yellows. The biggest flash we see happens during ~Desert Rose~; some fake fire effects that use paper and wind appear. It's a very conservative stage.<p><p>No, I don't require dancers, lasers and explosions; neither Bruce nor Bowie indulge in such antics and their shows are as good as it gets. I just want something interesting to watch; otherwise I might as well stay home and listen to the CD.<p><p>Or watch the DVD, as in this case. Actually, this program perfectly complements Sting's live show: it's a well-executed but bland presentation. The concert was filmed and edited in a most conservative manner, with no flashy camera moves or any kind of quick cuts. It's a fairly unexciting way to show the concert, but it works pretty well, especially since more daring techniques would have seemed so inappropriate here. I've seen concert videos that try to use effects and editing to ~spice up~ a performance; McCartney's Paul Is Live becomes almost unwatchable due to such antics.<p><p>As such, Sting Live is a moderately entertaining but fairly unexceptional concert video. It represents the show itself pretty well, which isn't a terrific compliment. I like Sting, and I'll continue to see him live, but I do so with somewhat low expectations. When you witness a Sting concert, you'll get a musically competent but drab performance that will likely leave your memory as soon as he departs the stage.<p><p>Note that although the DVD presents 18 songs, which is a fairly substantial roster, it doesn't include the entire setlist. The following tunes were performed at the October 29, 1999 concert but can't be found on this DVD: ~Roxanne~, ~Mad About You~, ~Fields of Gold~, ~Bring On the Night/When the World Is Falling Down You Make the Best of What's Still Around~, and ~If I Ever Lose My Faith In You~. Why'd they cut these songs? I have no clue. Since the DVD only runs about 88 minutes, I can see no reason to omit so many songs, especially since all of them are popular numbers; their absence would only hurt sales.<p><p>Also, although some publicity materials for the DVD claim that it contains all of the songs from ~Brand New Day~, this isn't true. The concert omits ~Big Lie Small World~, so only eight of that album's nine songs appear. Actually, the set features a pretty solid mix of elements from Sting's career, though the Police side seems underrepresented; only three of those tunes - ~Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic~, ~Every Breath You Take~ and ~Message In a Bottle~ - make the cut.<p><p>~The Dream of the Blue Turtles~, Sting's first solo album, is represented by ~If You Love Somebody Set Them Free~ and ~Moon Over Bourbon Street~, while follow-up ~.Nothing Like the Sun~ shows up via ~We'll Be Together~, ~Englishman In New York~ and ~Fragile~. ~Seven Days~ comes from ~Ten Summoner's Tales~, while ~Lithium Sunset~ represents ~Mercury Falling~. Albums completely neglected? Police titles ~Outlandos D'Amour~ and ~Zenyatta Mondatta~ plus Sting's ~The Soul Cages~. Note that if the six deleted tunes appeared on this DVD, those three absent albums would then be represented; ~Outlandos D'Amour~ featured ~Roxanne~, ~When the World.~ came from ~Zenyatta Mondatta~, and ~Mad About You~ was on ~The Soul Cages~. Too bad the omission keep this DVD from offering a better career overview.<p><p>The DVD:<p><p>Sting: The Brand New Day Tour Live From the Universal Ampitheatre appears in an aspect ratio of approximately 1.33:1 on this single-sided, single-layered DVD; due to those dimensions, the image has not been enhanced for 16X9 televisions. Overall, this show looked pretty solid, though the original videotaped material betrayed a few limitations that kept it from becoming great.<p><p>Sharpness appeared largely crisp and accurate throughout the concert. At times, many wider shots looked a bit soft and fuzzy, though this tendency seemed minor and wasn't a huge concern. Moiré effects were absent, but jagged edges cropped up with regularity; guitar strings and curves of instruments often cause such problems, and Sting was no exception. In regard to the source material, almost no flaws were discerned. I saw a blip or two, but no more significant problems, though the general blandness that comes from videotaped programs meant that the show lacked sparkle.<p><p>Almost all of the colors seen during the concert came from the lights; Sting and the band wear black or other dark tones. The lighting tended to feature warm, pastel hues, and violets, oranges, light reds, and blues dominated the proceedings. The videotapes nature of the program occasionally made the colors seem a little heavy, but for the most part they looked accurate and clear. Black levels appeared slightly pale at times, but they usually seemed deep and rich, and for low-light shots from the stage, shadow detail was appropriately dark but not excessively thick. Crowd views generally seemed much harder to discern, but I don't fault the production for that, since no lighting would be offered for those bits. All in all, the concert looked quite clean and watchable.<p><p>Also fine but unexceptional was the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack of the concert. Actually, Sting is perhaps the biggest star who supports 5.1 recordings; in addition to this DVD, you can buy DTS CDs of the Police's ~Greatest Hits~ plus Sting's ~.Nothing Like the Sun~, ~Ten Summoner's Tales~ , and ~Brand New Day~.<p><p>The soundfield heard on the DVD seemed pretty conservative. From the forward channels I detected decent stereo separation for the music but the mix didn't appear especially broad or well-defined. The instruments were placed in distinct locations to a degree, but they seemed to blend together in too mushy a manner; rarely did particular elements stand out very clearly. The surrounds were used simply to provide light reinforcement of the music and also to transmit occasional crowd noise. For all intents and purposes, this is a stereo soundtrack with a mild surround presence.<p><p>Audio quality seemed fairly strong. Sting's voice occasionally appeared too bright within the mix, and his vocals sometimes came across as slightly rough, but for the most part, his singing sounded clear and natural. The rest of the music seemed clean and relatively crisp throughout the proceedings. Dynamic range was good, though I thought the mix could have used strong low end. One oddity: at the start of ~Desert Rose~, the volume level escalates noticeably but returns to normal at the end of the song. Why does this happen? I have no idea, but keep the remote to your receiver handy; you'll likely want to knock down the volume a notch or two before the tune starts.<p><p>One thing I definitely liked about the soundtrack is that it seemed clear that no overdubs were performed to fix mistakes. The music sounded natural and real, and appears to come completely from an actual performance. These tendencies are best noted through some of Sting's vocals; you can easily hear him strain at times, and I'm pretty sure he messes up the first line to ~Every Breath You Take~: maybe I'm wrong, but I think he warbles, ~Every breath you make~. Hey, it may not sound like much, but a lot of performers would have fixed this error, and I appreciate the appropriate rawness that comes across through the audio.<p><p>Most music DVDs include literally no extras, so it's a pleasant surprise to find a minor addition to this disc. We get 15 minutes and 15 seconds of ~backstage footage~. This consists of a variety of semi-candid shots of Sting and others involved in the concert as they wait for the show to begin. It also includes a mix of interview snippets, most of which feature Sting's reflections on performing live and touring, but we hear a few lines from other band members and various production personnel as well. It's not exactly revelatory material, but it's a moderately interesting glimpse behind the scenes and it merits a look.<p><p>Ultimately, I recommend Sting: The Brand New Day Tour Live at the Universal Ampitheater just because I remain fond of his work and no other DVD representations of his music appear, but it's not a great program. The concert itself balanced different sides of his career fairly well, but the performance seemed somewhat drab and lifeless. The DVD offers solid though unexceptional picture and sound plus a nice extra. Sting fans will want to own this, but others may be less interested; I don't think it's the kind of video that will make any new devotees to his music.<p>&mdash; <b>Colin Jacobson</b>"

The name of the group was taken from Strange Creek, West Virginia, and they played a mixture of bluegrass and old-time musical styles, both traditional and contemporary. It was very much a hobbyist’s affair, given the commitments outside of the group of all concerned. Nevertheless, they toured both Europe and the USA, playing a number of major festivals in the process. Seeger is still recording, while Schwarz performs and tours with the Tracy Schwarz Cajun Trio. Dickens has also recorded solo.</p>",

One might also find these recordings spanning 1968 through 1970 full of charm and honesty. Four city kids are unsatisfied with the pop vocal groups and become enamored with the folk revival of the time. This is their worthy attempt to add to that honored body of work. Several bluegrass vocal favorites are treated here. Among them are ~Sunny Side of Life~ and ~Will the Circle Be Unbroken.~ While the Strange Creek Singers sometimes outdo themselves technically, their passion and love for their craft makes this album a classic.</p>"

		"lastname": "Talking Heads",
		"name": "Talking Heads",
		"biography": "<p>At the start of their career, Talking Heads were all nervous energy, detached emotion, and subdued minimalism. When they released their last album about 12 years later, the band had recorded everything from art-funk to polyrhythmic worldbeat explorations and simple, melodic guitar pop. Between their first album in 1977 and their last in 1988, Talking Heads became one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s, while managing to earn several pop hits. While some of their music can seem too self-consciously experimental, clever, and intellectual for its own good, at their best Talking Heads represent everything good about art-school punks.</p><p>And they were literally art-school punks. Guitarist/vocalist David Byrne, drummer Chris Frantz, and bassist Tina Weymouth met at the Rhode Island School of Design in the early '70s; they decided to move to New York in 1974 to concentrate on making music. The next year, the band won a spot opening for the Ramones at the seminal New York punk club CBGB. In 1976, keyboardist Jerry Harrison, a former member of Jonathan Richman's Modern Lovers, was added to the lineup. By 1977, the band had signed to Sire Records and released its first album, Talking Heads: 77. It received a considerable amount of acclaim for its stripped-down rock & roll, particularly Byrne's geeky, overly intellectual lyrics and uncomfortable, jerky vocals.</p><p>For their next album, 1978's More Songs About Buildings and Food, the band worked with producer Brian Eno, recording a set of carefully constructed, arty pop songs, distinguished by extensive experimenting with combined acoustic and electronic instruments, as well as touches of surprisingly credible funk. On their next album, the Eno-produced Fear of Music, Talking Heads began to rely heavily on their rhythm section, adding flourishes of African-styled polyrhythms. This approach came to a full fruition with 1980's Remain in Light, which was again produced by Eno. Talking Heads added several sidemen, including a horn section, leaving them free to explore their dense amalgam of African percussion, funk bass and keyboards, pop songs, and electronics.</p><p>After a long tour, the band concentrated on solo projects for a couple of years. By the time of 1983's Speaking in Tongues, the band had severed its ties with Eno; the result was an album that still relied on the rhythmic innovations of Remain in Light, except within a more rigid pop-song structure. After its release, Talking Heads embarked on another extensive tour, which would turn out to be their last; it's captured on the Jonathan Demme-directed concert film Stop Making Sense. After releasing the straightforward pop album Little Creatures in 1985, Byrne directed his first movie, True Stories, the following year; the band's next album featured songs from the film. Two years later, Talking Heads released Naked, which marked a return to their worldbeat explorations, although it sometimes suffered from Byrne's lyrical pretensions.</p><p>After its release, Talking Heads were put on ~hiatus~; Byrne pursued some solo projects, as did Harrison, and Frantz and Weymouth continued with their side project, Tom Tom Club. In 1991, the band issued an announcement that they had broken up. Five years later, the original lineup minus Byrne reunited as the Heads for the album No Talking Just Head. Then in 1999, all four worked together to promote a 15th-anniversary edition of Stop Making Sense.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b></p> ",

				"review": "<P>Up until 2004, Stop Making Sense was the only easily available live Talking Heads album on compact disc, but it caught the band in the second phase of its career, presenting a polished stage show after having arrived squarely in the mainstream with the success of Speaking in Tongues (their fifth album) and ~Burning Down the House~ in particular. It was a distinct change. Speaking in Tongues was their first new music in three years and was noticeably upbeat and danceable compared to the dark paranoia of Remain in Light and Fear of Music and the undistilled art-school geekiness of their first two albums. Stop Making Sense captured Talking Heads at the height of their popularity, but not at the height of their power. After all, it was those first four albums that established the band among critics and a fervent semiunderground following. And that's where The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads comes in. It was the perfect summary to the first phase of their career, presenting an LP of material performed by the original quartet (1977-1979) and an LP of material from the Remain in Light tours of 1980 and 1981 (featuring a greatly expanded band lineup). But alas, it languished in the strictly analog domain for more than two decades. In 2004, finally, The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads was made available on compact disc, and it may well have been worth the wait. Each version of the band is still given a disc of its own, but the longer running time of compact discs versus LPs means you're treated to almost double the original number of tracks.</P><P>The first disc, which features the original quartet, is brilliantly expanded with the original LP sequencing completely intact and all the bonus tracks coming between the LP sides (except for ~Heaven,~ the perfect album closer). The sound is crisp and clear, with tight drumming, a great punchy bass sound, and clearly separated guitars that allow you to really hear what complementary (and fine) players David Byrne and Jerry Harrison were. Byrne is the über-geek with a totally unique delivery (especially on tracks like ~Who Is It?,~ ~Artists Only,~ and ~Stay Hungry,~ not to mention his nervous stage announcements), but they all play with the raw energy of a young band on the way up. The bonus tracks are all excellent. There is no sense whatsoever that they were simply padding things for a longer running time, and it's just great hearing live versions of songs like ~Mind~ (with extended guitar solo), ~The Big Country,~ and ~The Book I Read~ that have never been readily available in live form. As fantastic as the first disc is, the second one is perhaps even more exciting. The expanded band (ten musicians and two backup singers) is amazing, not only adding power and punch to the Remain in Light material, but in most cases surpassing the studio versions (no mean feat). These live versions of ~The Great Curve,~ ~Houses in Motion,~ and ~Crosseyed and Painless (all prominently featuring Adrian Belew) are nearly worth the price of admission alone, but the bonus tracks here are just as exciting. The original release had no overlapping songs on the two LPs, with the large version of the band sticking solely to tunes from Remain in Light and Fear of Music. Now you're treated to arrangements of ~Psycho Killer,~ ~Stay Hungry,~ and ~Warning Sign~ as performed by the expanded lineup, not to mention live versions of ~Animals,~ ~Cities,~ and ~Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On).~<P></P>The band is on fire throughout the performances, and fans of Belew's guitar playing will practically be giddy with ecstasy. These are some of his finest performances strictly as a guitarist, and although Remain in Light was the only studio album he played on, he beautifully adds his own touches to ~Stay Hungry~ and especially ~Psycho Killer.~ Byrne also contributes some cool guitar, sometimes using a great delay sound, and again, the clear separation of instruments lets you really hear the details. The producers chose to depart from the album sequencing on this disc, opting to reproduce the entire set list in order instead. It works up until the end, where they move ~The Great Curve~ from its position at the beginning of side four and make it the album closer. It might be a more exciting song to finish the set, but folks who already know this album expect ~Take Me to the River~ to be the end, and it's a bit jarring to have the music continue after that (understanding this, the liner notes actually explain how to program the original album sequencing). However, that's a very minor quibble about a re-release that actually manages to vastly improve on an already excellent album. The liner notes also include a number of reviews of T-Heads live shows, and they wisely chose to reproduce all the band photos that originally decorated the inner sleeves as well.The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads is not only a vital document of an important, groundbreaking band on its way up, it's one of Talking Heads' best albums, easily surpassing Stop Making Sense. They were a young and hungry band making a name for themselves, pushing the boundaries of pop music and performing with palpable energy. Highly recommended.<P></P><P>— <B>Sean Westergaard</B></P>"

		"lastname": "Tangerene Dream",
		"name": "Tangerene Dream",
		"biography": "<p>Without doubt, the recordings of Tangerine Dream have made the greatest impact on the widest variety of instrumental music during the 1980s and '90s, ranging from the most atmospheric new age and space music to the harshest abrasions of electronic dance. Founded in 1967 by Edgar Froese in Berlin, the group has progressed through a full three dozen lineups (Froese being the only continuous member with staying power) and four distinct stages of development: the experimentalist minimalism of the late '60s and early '70s; stark sequencer trance during the mid- to late '70s, the group's most influential period; an organic form of instrumental music on their frequent film and studio work during the 1980s; and, finally, a more propulsive dance style, which showed Tangerine Dream with a sound quite similar to their electronic inheritors in the field of dance music.</p><p>Froese, born in Tilsit, East Prussia, in 1944, was little influenced by music while growing up. Instead, he looked to the Dadaist and Surrealist art movements for inspiration, as well as literary figures such as Gertrude Stein, Henry Miller, and Walt Whitman. He organized multimedia events at the residence of Salvador Dali in Spain during the mid-'60s and began to entertain the notion of combining his artistic and literary influences with music; Froese played in a musical combo called the Ones, which recorded just one single before dissolving in 1967. The first lineup of Tangerine Dream formed later that year, with Froese on guitar, bassist Kurt Herkenberg, drummer Lanse Hapshash, flutist Volker Hombach and vocalist Charlie Prince. The quintet aligned itself with contemporary American acid rock (the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane), and played around Berlin at various student events. The lineup lasted only two years, and by 1969 Froese had recruited wind player Conrad Schnitzler and drummer Klaus Schulze. One of the trio's early rehearsals, not originally intended for release, became the first Tangerine Dream LP when Germany's Ohr Records issued Electronic Meditation in June 1970. The LP was a playground for obtuse music-making -- keyboards, several standard instruments, and a variety of household objects were recorded and filtered through several effects processors, creating a sparse, experimentalist atmosphere.</p><p>Both Schulze and Schnitzler left for solo careers later in 1970, and Froese replaced them the following year with drummer Christopher Franke and organist Steve Schroeder. When Schroeder left a year later, Tangerine Dream gained its most stable lineup core when organist Peter Baumann joined the fold. The trio of Froese, Franke, and Baumann would continue until Baumann's departure in 1977, and even then, Froese and Franke would compose the spine of the group for an additional decade.</p><p>On 1971's Alpha Centauri and the following year's Zeit, the trio's increased use of synthesizers and a growing affinity for space music resulted in albums that pushed the margin for the style. Atem, released in 1973, finally gained Tangerine Dream widespread attention outside Europe; influential British DJ John Peel named it his LP of the year, and the group signed a five-year contract with Richard Branson's Virgin Records. Though less than a year old, Virgin had already become a major player in the recording industry, thanks to the massive success of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells (widely known for its use in the film The Exorcist).</p><p>Tangerine Dream's first album for Virgin, Phaedra, was an milestone not only for the group, but for instrumental music. Branson had allowed the group free rein at Virgin's Manor Studios, where they used Moog synthesizers and sequencers for the first time; the result was a relentless, trance-inducing barrage of rhythm and sound, an electronic update of the late-'60s and early-'70s classical minimalism embodied by Terry Riley. Though mainstream critics were unsurprisingly hostile toward the album (it obviously made no pretense to rock & roll in any form), Phaedra broke into the British Top 20 and earned Tangerine Dream a large global audience.</p><p>The follow-ups Rubycon and the live Ricochet were also based on the blueprint with which Phaedra had been built, but the release of Stratosfear in 1976 saw the use of more organic instruments such as untreated piano and guitar; also, the group added vocals for 1978's Cyclone, a move that provoked much criticism from their fans. Both of these innovations didn't change the sound in a marked degree, however; their incorporation into rigid sequencer patterns continued to distance Tangerine Dream from the mainstream of contemporary instrumental music.</p><p>Baumann left for a solo career in 1978 (later founding the Private Music label), and was replaced briefly by keyboard player Steve Jolliffe and then Johannes Schmoelling, another important member of Tangerine Dream who would stay until the mid-'80s. In 1980, the Froese/Franke/Schmoelling lineup was unveiled at the Palast der Republik in East Berlin, the first live performance by a Western group behind the Iron Curtain. Tangerine Dream also performed live on TV with the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra one year later, and premiered their studio work on 1980's Tangram.</p><p>Mike Oldfield had shown the effectiveness of using new instrumental music forms as a bed for film on Tubular Bells, and in 1977 The Exorcist's director, William Friedkin, had tapped Tangerine Dream for soundtrack work on his film Sorcerer. By the time the new lineup stabilized in 1981, Hollywood was knocking on the band's door; Tangerine Dream worked on more than 30 film soundtracks during the 1980s, among them Risky Business, The Keep, Flashpoint, Firestarter, Vision Quest, and Legend. If the idea of stand-alone electronic music hadn't entered the minds of mainstream America before this time, the large success of these soundtracks (especially Risky Business) entrenched the idea and proved enormously influential to soundtrack composers from all fields.</p><p>Despite all the jetting between Hollywood and Berlin, the group continued to record proper LPs and tour the world as well. Hyperborea, released in 1983, was their last album for Virgin, and a move to Zomba/Jive Records signaled several serious changes for the band during the late '80s. After the first Zomba release (a live concert recorded in Warsaw), 1985's Le Parc, marked the first time Tangerine Dream had flirted with sampling technology. The use of sampled material was an important decision to make for a group that had always investigated the philosophy of sound and music with much care, though Le Parc was a considerable success -- both fans and critics calling it their best LP in a decade. Tyger, released in 1987, featured more vocals than any previous Tangerine Dream LP, and many of the group's fans were quite dispirited in their disfavor.</p><p>Schmoelling left in 1988, to be replaced by the classically trained Paul Haslinger and (for a brief time) Ralf Wadephul. Optical Race, released in 1988, was the first Tangerine Dream album to appear on old bandmate Peter Baumann's Private Music label. Several more albums followed for the label, after which Haslinger left to work on composing film scores in Los Angeles. His replacement, and the only other permanent member of Tangerine Dream since, was Edgar's son Jerome Froese (whose photo had graced the cover of several TD albums in the past). Another record label change, to Miramar, preceded the release of 1992's Rockoon, which earned Tangerine Dream one of their seven total Grammy nominations. The duo continued to record and release live albums, remix albums, studio albums, and soundtracks at the rate of about two releases per year into the late '90s. Meanwhile, the influence of Tangerine Dream's '70s releases upon a generation of electronica and dance artists became increasingly evident, from the Orb's indebted ambient techno to DJ Shadow's sampling of Stratosfear's ~Invisible Limits,~ heard on ~Changeling,~ from 1996's Endtroducing....</p><p>During the early 2000s, new material surfaced at a slightly slower rate. In addition to a handful of studio albums -- including 2005's Jeanne d'Arc, for which Froese was first joined by Thorsten Quaeschning, a musician who would figure into several subsequent TD releases -- and a couple soundtracks (Great Wall of China, Mota Atma), there was ~the Dante trilogy~ (Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso, released from 2002 through 2006) and the five-part ~atomic seasons~ (with titles like Springtime in Nagasaki and Winter in Hiroshima, created for a Japanese man who survived the bombings of both cities). During these years, keeping tabs on archival releases, both live and studio, was more challenging than ever; most prominently, there was The Bootmoon Series, entailing audience and soundboard recordings of performances dating back to 1977, as well as reissues of the first four albums and several anthologies. Despite so much focus on the past, epitomized by 40th anniversary concerts that took place in 2007, Tangerine Dream remained equally connected to the present.</p>",

The result is best heard on the 15-minute title track, unparalleled before or since for its depth of sound and vision. Given focus by the arpeggiated trance that drifts in and out of the mix, the track progresses through several passages including a few surprisingly melodic keyboard lines and an assortment of eerie Moog and Mellotron effects, gaseous explosions, and windy sirens. Despite the impending chaos, the track sounds more like a carefully composed classical work than an unrestrained piece of noise. While the title track takes the cake, there are three other excellent tracks on Phaedra. ~Mysterious Semblance at the Strand of Nightmares~ is a solo Edgar Froese song that uses some surprisingly emotive and affecting synthesizer washes, and ~Movements of a Visionary~ is a more experimental piece, using treated voices and whispers to drive its hypnotic arpeggios. Perhaps even more powerful as a musical landmark now than when it was first recorded, Phaedra has proven the test of time.</p><p>&mdash;John Bush</p>"

The group was formed in 1967 and signed to Decca in England. Their first album was not a success, but their second, the live Undead (1968) containing ~I'm Going Home,~ a six-minute blues workout by the fleet-fingered Alvin, hit the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. Stonedhenge (1969) hit the U.K. Top Ten in early 1969. Ten Years After's U.S. breakthrough came as a result of their appearance at Woodstock, at which they played a nine-minute version of ~I'm Going Home.~ Their next album, Ssssh, reached the U.S. Top 20, and Cricklewood Green, containing the hit single ~Love Like a Man,~ reached number four. Watt completed the group's Decca contract, after which they signed with Columbia and moved in a more mainstream pop direction, typified by the gold-selling 1971 album A Space in Time and its Top 40 single ~I'd Love to Change the World.~ Subsequent efforts in that direction were less successful, however, and Ten Years After split up after the release of Positive Vibrations in 1974. They reunited in 1988 for concerts in Europe and recorded their first new album in 15 years, About Time, in 1989 before disbanding once again. In 2001, Ric Lee was preparing the back catalog for rerelease when he discoverd the Live at the Fillmore East 1970 tapes. He approached Alvin about getting back together to promote the lost album, but Alvin Lee declined. The rest of the band was up for it, though, and together with guitarist Joe Gooch, Ten Years After started touring again. In addition to touring the world, this new incarnation recorded their first new material in about a decade and a half and released Now in 2004 and added the live double CD set Roadworks in 2005.</P>&mdash; <b>William Ruhlmann</b>",

As a result, it was their first hit album in the U.S., peaking at number 20 in September of that year. This recording is a primer of British blues-rock of the era, showcasing Alvin Lee's guitar pyrotechnics and the band's propulsive rhythm section. As with most of TYA's work, the lyrics were throwaways, but the music was hot. Featured is a lengthy cover of Sonny Boy Williamson's ~Good Morning Little Schoolgirl,~ with reworked lyrics leaving little doubt what the singer had in mind for the title character. Also included was a twelve-bar blues song with the ultimate generic blues title, ~I Woke Up This Morning.~ Ssssh marked the beginning of the band's two-year run of popularity on the U.S. album charts and in the ~underground~ FM-radio scene.</p>&mdash; <b>Jim Newsom</b>"

In fact, ever since the mid-'50s, he has had no close competitors. Toots simply plays the harmonica with the dexterity of a saxophonist and has even successfully traded off with the likes of Oscar Peterson.</p><p>Toots Thielemans' first instrument was the accordion, which he started when he was three. Although he started playing the harmonica when he was 17, Thielemans' original reputation was made as a guitarist who was influenced by Django Reinhardt. Very much open to bop, Thielemans played in American GI clubs in Europe, visited the U.S. for the first time in 1947, and shared the bandstand with Charlie Parker at the Paris Jazz Festival of 1949. He toured Europe as a guitarist with the Benny Goodman Sextet in 1950, and the following year moved to the U.S. During 1953-1959, Toots was a member of the George Shearing quintet (mostly as a guitarist) and has freelanced ever since. He first recorded his big hit ~Bluesette~ (which featured his expert whistling and guitar) in 1961, and ever since has been greatly in demand (particularly for his harmonica and his whistling) on pop records (including many dates with Quincy Jones) and as a jazz soloist. Toots' two-volume <i>Brasil Project</i> was popular in the 1990s and found him smoothly interacting on harmonica with top Brazilian musicians.</p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b>",

		"biography": "<p>Rob Thomas was the singer and principal songwriter for Matchbox Twenty, a Florida-based adult alternative combo that found success with a blend of '70s rock influences, slick hooks, and 1990s post-grunge crunch. The band broke through in 1996 with ~Push~ and never looked back, issuing single after single, scoring hits in various radio formats, and watching its debut LP, <i>Yourself or Someone Like You</i>, go platinum 12 times over in the U.S. Thomas himself won numerous songwriting awards as the scribe of such Matchbox hits as ~Real World,~ ~If You're Gone,~ ~Bent,~ and ~Mad Season,~ and parlayed that success into a career as a solo artist. Rob Thomas was born February 14, 1972, on an Army base in Landstuhl, Germany. His parents divorced, and the ex-Army brat spent most of his childhood in South Carolina and Florida. He dropped out of high school at 17, and bounced around the South singing in pickup rock bands before landing in Orlando in 1993. There he helped form Tabitha's Secret, and the group had some regional success before Thomas, bassist Brian Yale, and drummer Paul Doucette left to form Matchbox Twenty with guitarists Adam Gaynor and Kyle Cook. Their debut, <i>Yourself or Someone Like You</i>, had gone five times platinum by 1998, and it established them as superstars even if Thomas wasn't individually well known.</p><p>That all changed with a song he co-wrote for the Carlos Santana album Supernatural. ~Smooth~ was ubiquitous in 1999, and it made Thomas a star. The track took home three Grammys including Song of the Year, and Thomas landed on People's ~Most Beautiful People~ list. He also married model Marisol Maldonado. <i>Mad Season</i> (2000) and <i>More Than You Think You Are</i> (2002) continued Matchbox Twenty's success, but after years of touring for both records, the bandmembers decided they needed a break, and Thomas used the hiatus to write and record his first solo album. When ~Lonely No More~ debuted in early 2005, its sleek and funky dance-pop sound was closer to Justin Timberlake than Matchbox, and it set up the April release of <i>Something to Be</i>.</p>&mdash; <b>Johnny Loftus</b>",

				"review": "<p>Since Matchbox Twenty is a faceless group, recognizable for its hits rather than its image, it's easy to assume that the band is nothing more than a solo project in disguise for its frontman, lead singer and chief songwriter Rob Thomas (who should not be confused with Rob Thomas, the creator of UPN's 2005 cult TV series Veronica Mars). Not only is he prominent in the band's videos and press, but he scored the biggest hit of his career with ~Smooth,~ a song he penned and sung for Santana's 1999 comeback, Supernatural. Even though Matchbox Twenty's 1996 debut, Yourself or Someone Like You, was a big hit and spawned four radio hits, ~Smooth~ was bigger than any of them, making Thomas famous, if not exactly a star. Instead of striking out for a solo career in 2000, he returned to his band, releasing Mad Season that year and More Than You Think You Are two years later. While both records had different moods -- the former was polished and radio-ready, the latter hit a little harder -- both found Thomas working as part of a unit, not as a flashy frontman. This may have illustrated how Matchbox Twenty worked as a band; in particular, More Than You Think You Are sounded like the work of a driven, cohesive unit, even the songs weren't quite up to snuff -- but they also had to sound a little workmanlike, and certainly not the product of the savvy cross-cultural crossover creator of ~Smooth.~ Given the relatively lackluster reception of More Than You Think You Are, the timing was right for Thomas to launch his official solo career in the spring of 2005. It was time to give his music a new coat of paint, similar to how ~Smooth~ spun his career in a different direction, and that's exactly what his solo debut, Something to Be, is: a slick new variation on Thomas' signature sound.</p><p>With its anthemic choruses and achingly sincere sentiments, Something to Be is clearly the work of the lead singer/songwriter of Matchbox Twenty, yet it lacks the lean rock-oriented sound of the group's albums, even if it is helmed by Matt Serletic, who has produced all three of the band's records. Serletic and Thomas have made a conscious attempt to have this solo album feel lighter, brighter, and a little hipper than Matchbox Twenty's music, adding slight drum loops and electronic elements to the rhythms while taking Thomas away from strictly guitar-based arrangements. Heavy on keyboards, elastic guitars, horns, insistent rhythms, and even the occasional gospel-inspired backing chorus or worldbeat inflection, this is a far splashier affair than the average Matchbox Twenty album, and that alone would make Something to Be a noteworthy solo record, since it is indeed a different beast than Thomas' regular gig, but the fresher sound is married to a strong set of songs that play to his strengths as a craftsman of big, anthemic post-alternative mainstream rock. This isn't edgy work by any means -- and for as hooky and chorus-driven as it is, it's music that becomes memorable through repeated plays, never quite catching hold upon the first listen -- but it's more colorful and well-constructed than a lot of contemporary mainstream rock in the mid-2000s, and it's arguably more appealing than Matchbox Twenty's earnest guitar rock, which can occasionally seem rather drab. With Something to Be, Thomas delivers an album that is at once familiar and fresh. It may not be something to win over the doubters, but it's enough to give him a promising new beginning to the second decade of his recording career, not unlike how ~Smooth~ helped propel him through the post-grunge fallout of the new millennium. [Something to Be is one of the first albums to be released solely as a DualDisc -- a disc that contains a CD of the album on one side and a DVD of the album with extras on the second side. The DVD contains a 5.1 mix of the album, lyrics for the 12 songs (these lyrics are also printed in the album's booklet), a link to Thomas' website, a plug for his charity Sidewalk Angels Foundation, a photo gallery containing nine photos, and a 20-minute making-of-the-album documentary that contains footage of Thomas writing, Thomas singing a lead vocal, John Mayer recording his cameo, and, finally, a photo shoot with Thomas.]</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

The above-mentioned warts (a cough here and there, a very occasional flubbed note) are tiny and difficult to spot, but Thompson was quite aware of them -- enough so that he persuaded Hannibal Records to delete the album from their catalog, though when the out-of-print album began fetching ridiculously high prices on the collectors market, he consented to a reissue in 1997. While the album is a hardly flawless recreation of the live Richard Thompson experience (and Thompson's solo acoustic shows would be noticeably stronger a few years down the line), it does capture Thompson's estimable charm as a stage performer with commendable accuracy, and the program is superb, featuring several Fairport Convention classics, a number of outstanding numbers from the Richard & Linda Thompson catalog, and a few otherwise unrecorded songs, most notably the devastating title track, which still stands as one of Richard's finest meditations on his favorite theme, love gone wrong. Small Town Romance may not be perfect, but it preserves a handful of passionate and impressive performances from one of the most gifted guitarists and songwriters around -- which puts it far ahead of the vast majority of live albums that will cross your path. Hopefully, though, one of Richard Thompson's even more dazzling solo shows from the 1990s will find it's way onto a widely available, non-bootleg CD some time in the future.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Mark Deming</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Richard Thompson is the sort of artist destined to be a cherished cult item rather than a bona fide star, which at the dawn of the 21th century puts him in an uncomfortable place in the music industry -- being able to reliably sell 100,000 copies of an album makes you too small for a major label, no matter how long they've kept you on the roster. In 2000, after a dozen years with Capitol Records, Thompson's contract was not renewed, and 2003's The Old Kit Bag found him recording for an independent for the first time since 1985. Creatively, this actually turns out to be a good thing; after the periodically excessive and self-conscious production Mitchell Froom imposed on nearly all of Thompson's releases for Capitol, 1999's Mock Tudor (produced by Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf) found Thompson going for a more lean and live sound, and with John Chelew at the controls, Thompson follows suit on The Old Kit Bag. Cut in a straightforward and stripped-down manner, with just bassist Danny Thompson, drummer Michael Jerome, and harmony vocalist Judith Owen along for company, The Old Kit Bag captures Thompson in spare but sympathetic circumstances; the performances are strong and confident, without a note or gesture wasted, and Thompson's interplay with his rhythm section is nothing short of superb. While Thompson eases back on the ~wow, listen to that!~ solos on The Old Kit Bag, his playing is fluid and superbly tasteful throughout, and his subtle overdubs show he's as good an accompanist as a bandleader. And Thompson's songwriting chops are still in superb shape; ~A Love You Can't Survive~ and ~I'll Tag Along~ are further meditations on Thompson's favorite theme, love and life gone wrong, and ~Outside of the Inside~ (which Thompson introduced on tour as ~a song about how the Taliban see the West~) is a chilling look inside a man blinded by his culture and his faith (and a bit of a surprise coming from a devout Muslim). The Old Kit Bag is Richard Thompson's simplest and most unadorned album since Shoot Out the Lights, and while it isn't an immediate masterpiece like that album, it confirms that this man's work is best presented at its simplest, and the result is a modest triumph.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Mark Deming</strong></p>"

		"biography": "<p>Jazz trumpeter Tomasz Stanko began his tenure as a major force in European free jazz in the early '60s with the formation of the quartet Jazz Darins in 1962 with Adam Makowicz. From 1963 to 1967 he played with Krzysztof Komeda in a group that revolutionized European jazz and made an impact across the Atlantic as well. Stanko also put in time with Andrzej Trzaskowski in the mid-'60s before leading his own quintet from 1968 to 1973. The Tomasz Stanko Quintet, which included Muniak and Zbigniew Seifert, garnered considerable critical acclaim, especially for their tribute to Komeda entitled Music for K. The early '70s brought collaborations with a number of avant-garde and creative jazz artists, including the Globe Unity Orchestra, Michal Urbaniak, Cecil Taylor, and Gary Peacock. From 1974 to 1978, Stanko played in a quartet with Edward Vesala, then returned to performing as a leader and soloist. The '80s brought Stanko collaborations with Chico Freeman in Freeman's group Heavy Life, as well as work with James Spaulding, Jack DeJohnette, and Rufus Reid. He was also briefly part of Cecil Taylor's big band in 1984. Shortly afterward, he formed another ensemble, Freelectronic. The '90s brought an alliance with ECM, which issued some of Stanko's most acclaimed work, including another lush, gorgeous tribute to Komeda, 1997's Litania, which was heavy with that composer's film work. The follow-up on ECM, 2000's From the Green Hill, drew from many of the same emotional and historic sources as Komeda's work, but this time the compositions were Stanko's. In 2002, Stanko's contributions to European jazz were honored when he was issued the very first European Prize, which was intended to honor outstanding European jazz musicians. During the final round of voting from 21 critics from as many countries, Stanko won ten votes, narrowly topping the runner-up, Dutch piano player Misha Mengelberg. That same year Soul of Things was released on ECM, followed by Suspended Night in 2004, also on ECM. Too Pee appeared in 2006, as did Chameleon and Lontano.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Stacia Proefrock</b></p> ",

				"review": "<p>The change of direction on Lontano, the third release by Polish trumpeter Tomasz Stanko and his three young collaborators — Marcin Wasilewski (piano), Slawomir Kurkiewicz (bass), and Michal Miskiewicz (drums) — is startling. Whereas Soul of Things (2002) and Suspended Night (2004) focused on Stanko's increasing sense of balladry and structurally harmonic, assonant atmospheres, Lontano showcases a band confident enough after playing for five years to find real space for free improvisation. Recorded in the south of France instead of Oslo, producer Manfred Eicher works his name magic and allows stillness and silence to play as much a role as the performers engaging one another musically. The opening title track is the first of three such excursions with the title ~Lontano.~ Here, Wasilewski's piano opens the door and allows for the band to haltingly and carefully enter the tune, contributing economically until a groove eventually develops out of one of Stanko's balladic ideas. Ever so slowly the beat becomes circular and focused, the band vamps on it, gradually gaining in intensity until it threatens to fall apart. But it never does. Instead the band winds it way back down into silence. ~Cyrhia~ begins as a thoughtful, hesitant ballad, but once more finds its way out into the world, entering it as a near-modal blues. ~Kattorna~ was originally performed by the Krzysztof Komeda group on its influential — and groundbreaking — album Astigmatic in 1965. Its angularity has been rounded off, but its sense of adventure is retained and Stanko's own economical style on playing, and then playing around its lyric line, is impressive, as is Kurkiewicz's empathic bassline. The other two ~Lontano~ pieces, at the middle and near the end of the disc, represent a kind of improvisation that actually sings. The interplay between the trio members and Stanko is instinctive. It's not nearly so hesitant and ranges farther than on ~Lontano I.~ Lyricism and melodic ideas are never sacrificed in this kind of improvisation, but the playing is so free it nearly leaves the realm of jazz altogether. This is outside playing with heart, tenderness, and quiet beauty in its marrow. The silences on ~Lontano III,~ are so vast, it's as if the listener can enter and remain inside any one of them. Indeed, this is music as poetry itself, a pure language at once crystalline and dreamy. The set closes with ~Tale,~ a piece Stanko recorded on his ECM debut in 1975. This version reflects restraint in its more euphoric spaces. The idea of story comes from the slowly unfolding piano chords of Wasilewski, who urges the trumpeter on to solo until the end, not so much of the piece, but until the story is complete. Lontano is at once the distillation of 40 years of European vanguard jazz history, and at once the key in the door of the lock where it enters the world not as a music categorized by its instrumentation or personnel, but as music itself; where harmonics, space, and the improvisational language expressed in it transcends genre and classification. This band is simply astonishing, and Lontano is their most adventurous and cohesive recording yet.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Since relocating to America from his native Europe, Polish trumpeter Tomasz Stanko has assembled a crack band to articulate his ever fluctuating, often experimental musical ideas. His New York Quartet, consisting of pianist David Virelles, bassist Thomas Morgan, and drummer Gerald Cleaver is a study in contrasts. The septuagenarian trumpeter proves as wily as ever on Wislawa, a double-disc titled for the late poet and Nobel Laureate Wislawa Szymborska, who passed away in 2012, and whose work and persona proved influential in composing the material for this set. Several of these pieces bear the titles of her poems. Stanko's signature brooding, cranky, tone-altering phrasing and disconsolate spirit of tenderness are apparent throughout, but they don't necessarily dictate the album's flow. Two versions of the title track bookend the album and showcase those qualities in balladic form, as do others such as ~April Song~; there is also plenty of fire here, evidenced by the aggressive interplay of the rhythm section on tracks such as ~Assassins~ and ~Metafizyka.~ ~Mikrokosmos~ is a Stanko showcase, offering at its opening all manner of squeals, skronks, sputters, and sharply angled tones before Virelles adds a Latin touch and the quartet settles into a groove. Likewise in the ~Dernier ~Cri,~ where the spirit of Miles Davis' second quintet is evoked. The second disc opens with ~Oni,~ led by Morgan's bass walk. It commences impressionistically, yet develops into an easy grooving post-bop thanks to the bassist and Cleaver's shimmering cymbal work. ~Tutaj - Here~ offers scintillating -- though often subtle -- interplay between Virelles and the trumpeter, while ~Faces~ presents the pianist's forceful, canny, harmonic assertions that the rhythm section responds to with near glee. Stanko is at his most fiery in this driven post-bop number that also recalls the Davis quintet's fearless sense of exploration. Throughout this set, Stanko leads this band as he has many others: by example. His democratic sensibilities allow his players to be fully themselves through his compositions, in turn adding depth and heft to them. Wislawa deftly celebrates in a deliberate way, not only the memory of an honored person in Stanko's life, but also the profound inspiration of her life's work upon his own.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

There is a lot of truth to the comparison, however, and it isn't exactly an insult. The guitarist, who also plays other instruments such as calabash and bongos, shares with Hooker (and similar American bluesmen like Lightnin' Hopkins) a predilection for low-pitched vocals and mid-tempo, foot-stomping rhythms, often playing with minimal accompaniment.</p><p>Toure's delivery is less abrasive than Hooker's, and the general tone of his material somewhat sweeter. Widespread success on the order of Hooker will probably not be in the offing, though, as Toure sings in several languages, and only occasionally in English. As he once told Option, his are songs ~about education, work, love, and society.~ If he and Hooker sound quite similar, it's probably not by conscious design, but due to the fact that both drew inspiration from African rhythmic and musical traditions that extend back many generations.</p><p>Toure was approaching the age of 50 when he came to the attention of the burgeoning world music community in the West via a self-titled album in the late '80s. Since then he's toured often in North America and Europe, and recorded frequently, sometimes with contributions from Taj Mahal and members of the Chieftains. 1994's Talking Timbuktu, on which he was joined by Ry Cooder, was his most well-received effort to date. It was also proof that not all Third World-First World collaborations have to dilute their non-Western elements to achieve wide acceptance. However, Toure didn't release a record on American shores for five years afterward; he finally broke the silence in 1999 with Niafunke, which discarded the collaborative approach in favor of a return to his musical roots.</p>&mdash; <b>Richie Unterberger</b>",

His playing often stretches beyond the boundaries of conventional jazz into world music and is quite distinctive. He started playing piano when he was three and trumpet at five, performing in a dance band when he was 13. Towner studied classical guitar in Vienna and played with classical chamber groups in the mid-'60s. After moving to New York in 1969, Towner worked with Jimmy Garrison, Jeremy Steig, and Paul Winter's Winter Consort (1970-1971). In the latter group, Towner first met up with Collin Walcott, Glen Moore, and Paul McCandless, and in 1971 they broke away to form Oregon, a highly versatile group that ranges from jazz and free improvisations to folk music. Towner (who guested with Weather Report in 1971 and played with Gary Burton a bit during 1974-1975) has performed and recorded with Oregon extensively since its formation, in addition to recording as a leader and with many other artists on the ECM label.</p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b> ",

Only ~Entry in a Diary~ and ~Mon Enfant~ are unaccompanied guitar solos; the latter, a traditional melody, is also the sole non-original. On four of the remaining six tracks, Towner accompanies himself via overdubs, playing both guitar and piano for an effect vaguely reminiscent of Bill Evans' Conversations With Myself. The best of these is ~Icarus,~ one of Towner's best-known compositions, which also appeared on Matchbook, his 1976 duo album with Gary Burton. The guitarist's most unusual moves include playing a set of gongs behind his sparse 12-string work on ~Images Unseen,~ and using his guitar entirely as a percussion instrument to create a propulsive rhythm track for ~Erg.~ He closes with a tuneful solo piano piece titled ~The Silence of a Candle.~ The reissue of Diary was timed to coincide with Towner's 2001 solo outing, Anthem.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>David R.

				"review": "<p>On this solo recording, Ralph Towner returns to the elementary sounds of his classical and 12-string guitars for inspiration. Though an accomplished pianist, French horn, and trumpet player, Towner has left all of them out of Anthem's stark mix. And it's a good thing too. There was a time when his love of the Prophet V synthesizer and his piano improvisations covered over the gracefulness of his trademark signature on the guitar. Anthem begins with ~Solitary Woman,~ for 12-string. It's based on modal intervals and harmonics. His sense of drama in the piece is remarkable; coming from a melodic framework and building an architecture of trills and single-string runs, he then evolves the piece into a chordal spiral, where semitones fall off in rows until only the melody remains -- skeletal, icy, crystalline. On the title track, he uses the classical guitar to create a riff-based structure, adding one element and then another, quoting from ~Greensleeves~ in one section until he has harmonically changed the entire structure of the tune's body, creating an almost Renaissance melody from its framework.</p><p><i>Anthem</i> reveals Towner in the role of being a composer for the guitar rather than of music. For example, City of Eyes, which was for an ensemble, relied both on composition and improvisation to offer a view of the album as something resembling a film score. Anthem has no such aspirations, but it's a far loftier album. These precise, moving, and technically virtuostic compositions have flair and depth to them; they accentuate the voices of these two guitars as solo instruments capable of carrying the most complex musical issues to the fore and resolving them. But above all, as the compositions ~The Lutemaker,~ ~Very Late,~ ~The Prowler,~ ~Gloria's Step,~ and ~Three Comments~ make plainly clear, Towner writes with great aesthetic beauty and settles for nothing less as a player. If there was ever any doubt of the latter being true, one need only hear the album's closing track, Charles Mingus' ~Goodbye Pork Pie Hat.~ Towner proves a consummate jazzman; his sensitivity to a complex melodic and harmonic work is instinctual. In fact, his reading of this tune is the most significant version heard on the instrument thus far -- and there have been many. Indeed, <i>Anthem</i> is Towner's finest album in a decade and one of the finest in his distinguished career.</p> &mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

Anthem was issued in 2000. Time Line is a return to the stark, spacious and lyrical explorations of that set. That's not to say this is any kind of direct replica. Towner's a restless artist, he pushes his boundaries on the classical and 12-string guitars. The set contains 14 new compositions and two fine covers that provide the real reason for Towner's not-so-secret inspiration here: George Gershwin's ~My Man's Gone Now,~ and Harold Arlen's ~Come Rain or Come Shine.~ The muse, of course, is Bill Evans. Evans has been forever associated with the former tune since his 1961 trio performance of it at the Village Vanguard; the latter is a tune he played live fairly often in the '60s and even the '70s. Time Line is full of lively, even, bright textures and moods. Check out the languid beauty of ~Turning of the Leaves~ or the nearly singing ~Always by Your Side,~ or the nearly Celtic folk aspects of ~Anniversary Song,~ where he plays airs and rounds. The moodier and more melancholy side of his playing can be heard in the brief ~Oleander Etude,~ or the tender, near flamenco single string playing in the 50-second section of ~Five Glimpses/3.~ ~Freeze Frame,~ the gorgeous 12-string exercise here, uses the instrument's droning quality to establish a harmonic resonance in spite of the legato playing he does on the higher strings. The set closes with the Gershwin tune, also played on the 12-string. His chromatic elegance and grace underscore the tune's nuances and subtleties even as he brings the lyric to the fore with extended chord voicings and embellishing the sonorities that echo the piano's more controlled tensions. In sum, this is a brief but utterly captivating issue from one of the music's great composers and theorists that should not be missed by anyone interested in Towner, of course, but also in melodic improvisation and composition.</P>— <B>Thom Jurek</B>"

				"review": "<p>Music from Lifehouse is a lovely record of two instantly famous concerts Pete Townshend performed in the winter of 2000, accompanied by the London Chamber Orchestra and sundry other musicians and vocalists. Undoubtedly the most rewarding failure in rock history, the Who's <i>Lifehouse</i> was kick-started and then abandoned in 1971 as a post-<i>Tommy</i> stage experiment. Composer Townshend's unwieldy dream of bringing together new music and controlled theatrical space with audience interaction sadly burst, but it also scattered song gems through various albums: <i>Who's Next</i>, Townshend's 1972 <i>Who Came First</i>, and <i>Lifehouse Elements</i> (2000).</p> <p>With passing years, Townshend has sought to unify and celebrate the music of his unrealized project, and this DVD, simultaneously contemplative and hard-charging, refines familiar warhorses (~Bargain,~ ~Pure and Easy,~ ~Baba O'Riley~) into works of refreshed beauty and gives Townshend a chance to shine on such lesser-known titles as ~Greyhound Girl.~ Often magical and surprisingly fun, this is a keeper for Townshend fanatics.</p>&mdash; <b>Tom Keogh</b> <p><b>Description</b><br>Thirty years have passed since Pete Townshend began work on ~<i>Lifehouse</i>,~ but it's only now that the technology exists to make the experimental nature of the piece a reality. This recording of the concerts held at Sadler's Wells in London on February 25 and 26, 2000, is a celebration of the music of ~<i>Lifehouse</i>~ rather than the culmination of the project. To this day, Pete Townshend is continuing the exciting musical experiments he first pioneered in a small South London theatre back in 1971. Songs: Fantasia Upon One Note, Teenage Wasteland, Love Ain't For Keeping, Greyhound Girl, Mary, I Don't Know Myself, Bargain, Pure and Easy, Baba O'Riley, Behind Blue Eyes, Let's See Action, Getting in Tune, Relay, Join Together, Won't Get Fooled Again, Can You Help the One You Really Love?</p>"

		"lastname": "Traffic",
		"name": "Traffic",
		"biography": "<p>Though it ultimately must be considered an interim vehicle for singer/songwriter/keyboardist/guitarist Steve Winwood, Traffic was a successful group that followed its own individual course through the rock music scene of the late '60s and early '70s. Beginning in the psychedelic year of 1967 and influenced by the Beatles, the band early on turned out eclectic pop singles in its native Great Britain, though by the end of its first year of existence it had developed a pop-rock hybrid tied to its unusual instrumentation: At a time when electric guitars ruled rock, Traffic emphasized Winwood's organ and the reed instruments played by Chris Wood, especially flute. After Dave Mason, who had provided the band with an alternate folk-pop sound, departed for good, Traffic leaned toward extended songs that gave its players room to improvise in a jazz-like manner, even as the rhythms maintained a rock structure. The result was international success that ended only when Winwood finally decided he was ready to strike out on his own.</p><p>Steve Winwood (born May 12, 1948) first attracted attention when, at the age of 15, he and his older brother Muff formed a band in their native Birmingham, England, with Spencer Davis and Pete York, eventually called the Spencer Davis Group. They were signed by record executive Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records, and began recording in 1964. As the band's vocalist, Winwood received the lion's share of attention. By the time he and his brother quit the group in April 1967, the Spencer Davis Group had amassed four Top Ten singles and three Top Ten albums in the U.K., two of those singles also reaching the Top Ten in the U.S.</p><p>Still not yet 19 years old, Winwood formed Traffic with three 22-year-old friends who had played in lesser-known bands -- drummer/singer Jim Capaldi (born August 24, 1944), singer/guitarist Mason (born May 10, 1944), and Wood (June 24, 1944 -- July 12, 1983). In the spirit of the times (and despite Winwood's prominence), the group was intended to be a cooperative, with the members living together in a country cottage in Berkshire and collaborating on their songs. Blackwell quickly signed them and released their debut single, ~Paper Sun,~ which peaked in the U.K. Top Five in July 1967 and also spent several weeks in the lower reaches of the charts in America, where Blackwell licensed it to United Artists Records, as he had the Spencer Davis Group's recordings.</p><p>Meanwhile, as Traffic recorded material for its debut album during the summer of 1967, its communal outlook was disrupted by Mason, who, unlike Winwood (a composer who needed help with lyrics and therefore tended toward collaboration), was capable of writing songs on his own and did so. The success of ~Paper Sun~ encouraged Blackwell to release a follow-up single quickly, and he chose as the most likely candidate among the songs Traffic had recorded so far ~Hole in My Shoe,~ written and sung by Mason. It became an even bigger hit than ~Paper Sun,~ almost topping the British charts in October, but that didn't sit well with Winwood, who felt it was unrepresentative of the sound he wanted for Traffic. The group's third single was ~Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush,~ the title song from a motion picture, which became their third British Top Ten hit in December, the same month that their debut album, <i>Mr. Fantasy</i>, was released. It, too, earned a Top Ten ranking in January 1968, but by then Mason had left Traffic. A fourth single, ~No Face, No Name, No Number,~ culled from the album, made the British Top 40 in March, the month that Traffic debuted as a live attraction in the U.S., where <i>Mr. Fantasy</i> (initially titled Heaven Is in Your Mind) reached the Top 100.</p><p>Traffic encountered two problems as a trio. First, given its unusual instrumentation, it had difficulty onstage doing without a player like Mason, who could handle the bass guitar work. In his absence, Winwood was forced to fill in the bass sound by playing the organ's bass pedals with his feet while simultaneously playing the organ keyboards with his hands and singing. Second, without a prolific writer like Mason, the group had more difficulty coming up with enough new material to satisfy its contractual commitments. As a result, Winwood, Capaldi, and Wood reconciled with Mason, who rejoined Traffic in the spring of 1968 and contributed heavily to the band's second album, <i>Traffic</i>, writing half of the songs, among them ~Feelin' Alright?,~ which went on to become a rock standard, particularly after Joe Cocker's 1969 cover version became an American Top 40 hit in 1972.</p><p><i>Traffic</i> was released in October 1968, and the band went on tour in the U.S. to promote it. But just after the start of the tour, Winwood, Capaldi, and Wood fired Mason. Then, at the conclusion of the tour, Winwood withdrew, announcing the breakup of Traffic at the beginning of 1969. These events notwithstanding, the album reached the U.K. Top Ten and the U.S. Top 20. And breakup or no, Winwood was contracted to Island and United Artists for five albums, of which only two had been delivered. Thus, in April 1969, the labels released <i>Last Exit</i>, a collection of non-LP singles sides, outtakes, and live recordings. It was another Top 20 success in America.</p><p>Meanwhile, Capaldi and Wood rejoined Mason along with keyboardist Wynder K. Frog in the short-lived band Wooden Frog, which never recorded, and Winwood teamed with former Cream members Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker as well as former Family member Ric Grech (November 1, 1946 -- March 16, 1990) in Blind Faith. This highly touted supergroup made one album, <i>Blind Faith</i>, which topped the charts in the U.S. and U.K., and played one American tour before breaking up. Still owing his record labels two albums, Winwood began work on a solo record in early 1970, but quickly brought in Capaldi and Wood and turned it into a Traffic LP. <i>John Barleycorn Must Die</i> was released in June 1970. In the U.S., it was a gold-selling Top Ten hit; in the U.K. it reached the Top 20.</p><p>Embarking on extensive touring, Traffic expanded its lineup, adding Ric Grech on bass. In the spring of 1971, in anticipation of British and American touring, drummer Jim Gordon, formerly of Derek and the Dominos, was brought in, as was percussionist Reebop Kwaku Baah. Also joining for a handful of U.K. dates was Dave Mason, who had in the meantime become a solo star with his 1970 album <i>Alone Together</i>. The band was able to work off its contractual commitment with a live album from this lineup, <i>Welcome to the Canteen</i>, released in September. Re-signed to Island, which began releasing albums in the U.S. as well as the U.K., Traffic quickly followed in November with the studio album <i>The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys</i>, which reached the American Top Ten and sold a million copies, though, in an indication of the group's increasingly international focus, it didn't even chart back home in Britain.</p><p>A winter 1971-1972 tour was aborted by Winwood's poor health (he was later revealed to be suffering from peritonitis), and Grech and Gordon left the band, while Capaldi recorded his debut solo album, <i>Oh How We Danced</i>; it reached the American Top 100. In the fall of 1972, with Winwood recovered, Traffic convened to record a new album, adding drummer Roger Hawkins and bassist David Hood, members of the studio band at the famed Muscle Shoals recording studio. (Keyboardist Barry Beckett, another Muscle Shoals alumnus, played with the band live.) <i>Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory</i>, released in January 1973, reached the American Top Ten and went gold. The world tour that promoted it was chronicled on <i>Traffic -- on the Road</i>, released in October 1973.</p><p>At the end of the tour, the Muscle Shoals musicians returned home and Kwaku Baah also left Traffic, which recruited bassist Rosko Gee. Capaldi released a second solo album, <i>Whale Meat Again</i>, in the summer of 1974; ~It's All up to You~ from it reached the U.K. Top 40. With Traffic, he recorded a new album, <i>When the Eagle Flies</i>, released in September. It was the band's fourth consecutive studio album to reach the American Top Ten and go gold, and the group toured to support it, but at the conclusion of the tour Traffic silently disbanded.</p><p>With a headstart on a solo career, Capaldi scored a Top Five hit in the U.K. in 1975 with a cover of ~Love Hurts~ from his third album, <i>Short Cut Draw Blood</i>. (The single charted in the U.S., but lost out to a competing version by Nazareth.) Along with former Santana drummer Michael Shrieve, Winwood participated prominently in Japanese percussionist Stomu Yamashta's concept album <i>Go</i>, which made the Top 100 in the U.S. in 1976. In 1977, he finally made his solo bow, releasing the modestly successful album <i>Steve Winwood</i>. A three-and-a-half year silence ensued, broken by the 1980 release of <i>Arc of a Diver</i>, which hit the American Top Five and went platinum, paced by the Top Ten single ~While You See a Chance.~ 1982's <i>Talking Back to the Night</i> was a commercial disappointment, but Winwood had the greatest success of his career with 1986's <i>Back in the High Life</i>, a multi-million seller that threw off four Top 20 singles, among them the chart-topping ~Higher Love.~ In 1987, ~Valerie,~ a remixed version of a song from </i>Talking Back to the Night</i>, hit the Top Ten. 1988's <i>Roll With It</i> was another multi-platinum seller for Winwood, with both the album and the title song topping the charts. But <i>Refugees of the Heart</i> (1990) was less successful. In 1994, Winwood announced a reunion with Capaldi (Wood had died of liver failure), who had continued to record solo albums with diminishing success. The two made a new album, <i>Far From Home</i>, and toured as Traffic during the summer. The album quickly reached the U.S. and U.K. Top 40, but did not sell well, and the tour also performed disappointingly, signaling another retirement of the Traffic name. Nevertheless, the 1967-1974-era band continued to enjoy significant status as a classic rock act, its albums earning CD reissues along with the release of compilations like <i>Smiling Phases</i> (1991) and <i>Feelin' Alright: The Very Best of Traffic</i> (2000).</p>&mdash; <b>William Ruhlmann</b>",

Meanwhile, former band member Steve Winwood formed Blind Faith, which produced a debut album that topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. No wonder Island and UA determined that the fall of 1969 was a good time for a Traffic compilation. The release was especially needed in Britain, where the singles sides ~Paper Sun,~ ~Hole in My Shoe,~ and ~Smiling Phases~ had not yet appeared on an LP. Since Traffic had moved away from being a singles band after its first year, the album was not dubbed a hits collection, though all its tracks had been released on one side or the other of a single on one side or the other of the Atlantic. As a selection of the best and most popular material from the group's first three albums, the result is hard to fault, though it's worth noting that the missing ~Here We Go 'Round the Mulberry Bush,~ the theme song from the 1967 movie of the same name, was a Top Ten hit in England. Also missing, on the British version of the LP, anyway, was ~You Can All Join In,~ a song that had enjoyed popularity in continental Europe. (The American version did include ~You Can All Join In,~ which replaced ~Smiling Phases.~) The group's U.K. hit singles, ~Paper Sun~ and ~Hole in My Shoe,~ were already beginning to sound like quaint bits of psychedelia by 1969, but the entire second side of the LP, comprising ~Medicated Goo,~ ~Forty Thousand Headmen,~ ~Feelin' Alright,~ ~Shanghai Noodle Factory,~ and ~Dear Mr. Fantasy,~ was the kind of progressive rock that would define Traffic and give it its place in the rock pantheon. Who could have known when this disc was first released that the band's story was far from over?</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

The album chronicled a late edition of the band in which original members Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, and Chris Wood were augmented not only by percussionist Reebop Kwaku Baah, but also by a trio of session musicians from the famed Muscle Shoals studio, Roger Hawkins, David Hood, and Barry Beckett. The studio pros lent a tightness and proficiency to their characteristic free-form jams, and though they sometimes sounded like they couldn't wait to get the songs over with, the tunes went on and on, four clocking in at over ten minutes. That might have been okay if the choice of material had been more balanced across the band's career, but 1971's Welcome To the Canteen had treated earlier efforts, and the 1973 tour was promoting Shoot Out At the Fantasy Factory, from which three of the six selections were drawn. Unfortunately, that album was not one of Traffic's best, and the live versions of its songs were no more impressive than the studio ones had been. Traffic: On the Road featured plenty of room for soloing by some good musicians, but it was the logical extreme of the band's forays into extended performance, with single tunes taking up entire sides on the original LPs. It's not surprising that, after this, Traffic shrunk in size and returned to shorter songs. [Though best known in its two-LP version, Traffic: On the Road was initially released in the U.S. as a single LP containing only four tracks.]</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

But the question of whether Winwood and Capaldi could validly constitute Traffic by themselves was not addressed until 1994, 20 years after the group disbanded, when the two surprisingly announced they would be recording and touring under their old band name. The album they made together sounded for the most part like a Winwood solo album. He played most of the instruments and sang (Capaldi drummed and sang occasional backup vocals), and he didn't show much interest in the lengthy instrumental passages that characterized Traffic in its heyday. Winwood, the composer, had simply moved on from that old style, and since the new Traffic wasn't a band in any real sense, its sound reflected his contemporary concerns. But if you listened to the lyrics, written by Capaldi, you did hear traces of the old Traffic. Granted, lyrics were not among Traffic's strong suits, but Capaldi, in his sometimes roundabout way, did have certain continuing concerns -- a generalized sense of spirituality, a tendency to give advice, and a rejection of the negative aspects of modern society. Winwood may have wished to return to music of greater substance, and if so, he got what he wanted; Far from Home certainly explored weightier topics than a Steve Winwood album. But Capaldi hadn't really improved as a writer over the years, and the final product still worked better musically than lyrically, and, to most ears, didn't really sound like a Traffic album. The resulting confusion kept the album from having much commercial impact.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

		"name": "Jethro Tull",
		"biography": "<p>Jethro Tull was a unique phenomenon in popular music history. Their mix of hard rock; folk melodies; blues licks; surreal, impossibly dense lyrics; and overall profundity defied easy analysis, but that didn't dissuade fans from giving them 11 gold and five platinum albums. At the same time, critics rarely took them seriously, and they were off the cutting edge of popular music since the end of the 1970s. But no record store in the country would want to be without multiple copies of each of their most popular albums (Benefit, Aqualung, Thick as a Brick, Living in the Past), or their various best-of compilations, and few would knowingly ignore their newest releases. Of their contemporaries, only Yes could claim a similar degree of success, and Yes endured several major shifts in sound and membership in reaching the 1990s, while Tull remained remarkably stable over the same period. As co-founded and led by wildman-flautist-guitarist-singer-songwriter Ian Anderson, the group carved a place all its own in popular music.</p><p>Tull had its roots in the British blues boom of the late '60s. Anderson (b. Aug. 10, 1947, Edinburgh, Scotland) had moved to Blackpool when he was 12. His first band was called the Blades, named after James Bond's club, with Michael Stephens on guitar, Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond (b. July 30, 1946) on bass and John Evans (b. Mar. 28, 1948) on drums, playing a mix of jazzy blues and soulful dance music on the northern club circuit. In 1965, they changed their name to the John Evan Band (Evan having dropped the ~s~ in his name at Hammond's suggestion) and later the John Evan Smash. By the end of 1967, Glenn Cornick (b. Apr. 24, 1947, Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England) had replaced Hammond-Hammond on bass. The group moved to Luton in order to be closer to London, the center of the British blues boom, and the band began to fall apart, when Anderson and Cornick met guitarist/singer Mick Abrahams (b. Apr. 7, 1943, Luton, Bedfordshire, England) and drummer Clive Bunker (b. Dec. 12, 1946), who had previously played together in the Toggery Five and were now members of a local blues band called McGregor's Engine.</p><p>In December of 1967, the four of them agreed to form a new group. They began playing two shows a week, trying out different names, including Navy Blue and Bag of Blues. One of the names that they used, Jethro Tull, borrowed from an 18th-century farmer/inventor, proved popular and memorable, and it stuck. In January of 1968, they cut a rather derivative pop-folk single called ~Sunshine Day,~ released by MGM Records (under the misprinted name Jethro Toe) the following month. The single went nowhere, but the group managed to land a residency at the Marquee Club in London, where they became very popular.</p><p>Early on, they had to face a problem of image and configuration, however. In the late spring of 1968, managers Terry Ellis and Chris Wright (who later founded Chrysalis Records) first broached the idea that Anderson give up playing the flute, and to allow Mick Abrahams to take center stage. At the time, a lot of blues enthusiasts didn't accept wind instruments at all, especially the flute, as seminal to the sound they were looking for, and as a group struggling for success and recognition, Jethro Tull was just a little too strange in that regard. Abrahams was a hardcore blues enthusiast who idolized British blues godfather Alexis Korner, and he was pushing for a more traditional band configuration, which would've put him and his guitar out front. As it turned out, they were both right. Abrahams' blues sensibilities were impeccable, but the audience for British blues by itself couldn't elevate Jethro Tull any higher than being a top club act. Anderson's antics on-stage, jumping around in a ragged overcoat and standing on one leg while playing the flute, and his use of folk sources as well as blues and jazz, gave the band the potential to grab a bigger audience and some much-needed press attention.</p><p>They opened for Pink Floyd on June 29, 1968, at the first free rock festival in London's Hyde Park, and in August they were the hit of the Sunbury Jazz & Blues Festival in Sunbury-on-Thames. By the end of the summer, they had a recording contract with Island Records. The resulting album, This Was, was issued in November. By this time, Anderson was the dominant member of the group on-stage, and at the end of the month Abrahams exited the band. The group went through two hastily recruited and rejected replacements, future Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi (who was in Tull for a week, just long enough to show up in their appearance on the Rolling Stones' Rock 'N Roll Circus extravaganza), and Davy O'List, the former guitarist with the Nice. Finally, Martin Barre (b. Nov. 17, 1946), a former architecture student, was the choice for a permanent replacement.</p><p>It wasn't until April of 1969 that This Was got a U.S. release. Ironically, the first small wave of American Jethro Tull fans were admiring a group whose sound had already changed radically; in May of 1969, Barre's first recording with the group, ~Living in the Past,~ reached the British number three spot and the group made its debut on Top of the Pops performing the song. The group played a number of festivals that summer, including the Newport Jazz Festival. Their next album, Stand Up, with all of its material (except ~Bouree,~ which was composed by Johann Sebastian Bach) written by Ian Anderson, reached the number one spot in England the next month. Stand Up also contained the first orchestrated track by Tull, ~Reasons for Waiting,~ which featured strings arranged by David Palmer, a Royal Academy of Music graduate and theatrical conductor who had arranged horns on one track from This Was. Palmer would play an increasingly large role in subsequent albums, and finally join the group officially in 1977.</p><p>Meanwhile, ~Sweet Dream,~ issued in November, rose to number seven in England, and was the group's first release on Wright and Ellis' newly formed Chrysalis label. Their next single, ~The Witch's Promise,~ got to number four in England in January of 1970. The group's next album, Benefit, marked their last look back at the blues, and also the presence of Anderson's longtime friend and former bandmate John Evan -- who had long since given up the drums in favor of keyboards -- on piano and organ. Benefit reached the number three spot in England, but, much more important, it ascended to number 11 in America, and its songs, including ~Teacher~ and ~Sossity, You're A Woman,~ formed a key part of Tull's stage repertory. In early July of 1970, the group shared a bill with Jimi Hendrix, B.B. King, and Johnny Winter at the Atlanta Pop Festival in Byron, GA, before 200,000 people.</p><p>By the following December, after another U.S. tour, Cornick had decided to leave the group, and was replaced on bass by Anderson's childhood friend Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond. Early the following year, they began working on what would prove to be, for many fans, the group's magnum opus, Aqualung. Anderson's writing had been moving in a more serious direction since the group's second album, but it was with Aqualung that he found the lyrical voice he'd been seeking. Suddenly, he was singing about the relationship between man and God, and the manner in which -- in his view -- organized religion separated them. The blues influences were muted almost to non-existence, but the hard rock passages were searing and the folk influences provided a refreshing contrast. That the album was a unified whole impressed the more serious critics, while the kids were content to play air guitar to Martin Barre's high-speed breaks. And everybody, college prog rock mavens and high-school time-servers alike, seemed to identify with the theme of alienation that lay behind the music.</p><p>Aqualung reached number seven in America and number four in England, and was accompanied by a hugely successful American tour. Bunker quit the band to get married, and was replaced by Anderson's old John Evan Smash bandmate Barriemore Barlow (b. Sept. 10, 1949). Late in 1971, they began work on their next album, Thick as a Brick. Structurally more ambitious than Aqualung, and supported by an elaborately designed jacket in the form of a newspaper, this record was essentially one long song steeped in surreal imagery, social commentary, and Anderson's newly solidified image as a wildman-sage. Released in England during April of 1972, Thick as a Brick got as high as the number five spot, but when it came out in America a month later, it hit the number one spot, making it the first Jethro Tull album to achieve greater popularity in American than in England. In June of 1972, in response to steadily rising demand for the group's work, Chrysalis Records released Living in the Past, a collection of tracks from their various singles and British EPs, early albums, and a Carnegie Hall show, packaged like an old-style 78 rpm album in a book that opened up.</p><p>At this point, it seemed as though Jethro Tull could do no wrong, and for the fans that was true. For the critics, however, the group's string ran out in July of 1973 with the release of A Passion Play. The piece was another extended song, running the length of the album, this time steeped in fantasy and religious imagery far denser than Aqualung; it was divided at the end of one side of the album and the beginning of the other by an A.A. Milne-style story called ~The Hare That Lost His Spectacles.~ This time, the critics were hostile toward Anderson and the group, attacking the album for its obscure lyrical references and excessive length. Despite these criticisms, the album reached number one in America (yielding a number eight single edited from the extended piece) and number 13 in England. The real venom, however, didn't start to flow until the group went on tour that summer. By this time, their sets ran to two-and-a-half hours, and included not only the new album done in its entirety (~The Hare That Lost His Spectacles~ being a film presentation in the middle of the show), but Thick As a Brick and the most popular of the group's songs off of Aqualung and their earlier albums. Anderson was apparently unprepared for the searing reviews that started appearing, and also took the American rock press too seriously. In the midst of a sell-out U.S. tour, he threatened to cancel all upcoming concerts and return to England. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed, especially once he recognized that the shows were completely sold out and audiences were ecstatic, and the tour continued without interruption.</p><p>It was 16 months until the group's next album, War Child -- conceived as part of a film project that never materialized -- was released, in November of 1974. The expectations surrounding the album gave it pre-order sales sufficient to get it certified gold upon release, and it was also Tull's last platinum album, reaching number two in America and number 14 in England. The dominant theme of War Child seemed to be violence, though the music's trappings heavily featured Palmer's orchestrations, rivaling Barre's electric guitar breaks for attention. In any case, the public seemed to respond well to the group's return to conventional length songs, with ~Bungle in the Jungle~ reaching number 11 in America. Tull's successful concert tour behind this album had them augmented by a string quartet.</p><p>During this period, Anderson became involved with producing an album by Steeleye Span, a folk-rock group that was also signed to Chrysalis, and who had opened for Tull on one of their American tours. Their music slowly begun influencing Anderson's songwriting over the next several years, as the folk influence grew in prominence, a process that was redoubled when he took up a rural residence during the mid-'70s. The next Tull album, Minstrel in the Gallery, showed up ten months later, in September of 1975, reaching number seven in the United States. This time, the dominant theme was Elizabethan minstrelsy, within an electric rock and English folk context. The tracks included a 17-minute suite that recalled the group's earlier album-length epic songs, but the album's success was rather more limited.</p><p>The Jethro Tull lineup had been remarkably stable ever since Clive Bunker's exit after Aqualung, remaining constant across four albums in as many years. In January of 1976, however, Hammond-Hammond left the band to pursue a career in art. His replacement, John Glascock (b. 1953), joined in time for the recording of Too Old to Rock 'n Roll, Too Young to Die, an album made up partly of songs from an un-produced play proposed by Anderson and Palmer, released in May of 1976. The group later did an ITV special built around the album's songs. The title track, however (on which Steeleye Span's Maddy Prior appeared as a guest backing vocalist), became a subject of controversy in England, as critics took it to be a personal statement on Anderson's part.</p><p>In late 1976, a Christmas EP entitled Ring Out Solstice Bells got to number 28. This song later turned up on their next album, Songs From the Wood, the group's most artistically unified and successful album in some time (and the first not derived from an unfinished film or play since A Passion Play). This was Tull's folk album, reflecting Anderson's passion for English folk songs. Its release also accompanied the band's first British tour in nearly three years. In May of 1977, David Palmer joined Tull as an official member, playing keyboards on-stage to augment the richness of the group's concert sound.</p><p>Having lasted into the late '70s, Jethro Tull now found itself competing in a new musical environment, as journalists and, to an increasing degree, fans became fixated on the growing punk rock phenomenon. In October 1977, Repeat (The Best of Jethro Tull, Vol. 2), intended to fill an anticipated 11 month gap between Tull albums, was released on both sides of the Atlantic. Unfortunately, it contained only a single new track and never made the British charts, while barely scraping into the American Top 100 albums. The group's next new album, Heavy Horses, issued in April of 1978, was Anderson's most personal work in several years, the title track expressing his regret over the disappearance of England's huge shire horses as casualties of modernization. In the fall of 1978, the group's first full-length concert album, the double-LP Live-Bursting Out, was released to modest success, accompanied by a tour of the United States and an international television broadcast from Madison Square Garden.</p><p>1979 was a pivotal and tragic year for the group. John Glascock died from complications of heart surgery on November 17, five weeks after the release of Stormwatch. Tull was lucky enough to acquire the services of Dave Pegg, the longtime bassist for Fairport Convention, which had announced its formal (though, as it turned out, temporary) breakup. The Stormwatch tour with the new lineup was a success, although the album was the first original release by Jethro Tull since This Was not to reach the U.S. Top 20. Partly thanks to Pegg's involvement with the Tull lineup, future tours by Jethro Tull, especially in America, would provide a basis for performances by re-formed incarnations of Fairport Convention.</p><p>The lineup change caused by Glascock's death led to Anderson's decision to record a solo album during the summer of 1980, backed by Barre, Pegg, and Mark Craney on drums, with ex-Roxy Music/King Crimson multi-instrumentalist Eddie Jobson on violin. The record, A, was eventually released as a Jethro Tull album in September of 1980, but even the Tull name didn't do much for its success. Barlow, Evan, and Palmer, however, were dropped from the group's lineup with the recording of A, and the new version of Jethro Tull toured in support of the album. Jobson left once the tour was over, and it was with yet another new lineup -- including Barre, Pegg, and Fairport Convention alumnus Gerry Conway (drums) and Peter-John Vettesse (keyboards) -- that The Broadsword and the Beast was recorded in 1982. Although this album had many songs based on folk melodies, its harder rocking passages also had a heavier, more thumping beat than earlier versions of the band had produced, and the use of the synthesizer was more pronounced than on previous Tull albums.</p><p>In 1983, Anderson confined his activities to his first official solo album, Walk Into Light, which had a very different, synthesizer-dominated sound. Following its lackluster performance, Anderson revived Jethro Tull for the album Under Wraps, released in September of 1984. At number 76 in the U.S., it became the group's poorest selling album, partly a consequence of Anderson's developing a throat infection that forced the postponement of much of their planned tour. No further Tull albums were to be released until Crest of a Knave in 1987, as a result of Anderson's intermittent throat problems. In the meantime, the group appeared on a German television special in March of 1985, and participated in a presentation of the group's work by the London Symphony Orchestra. To make up for the shortfall of new releases, Chrysalis released another compilation, Original Masters, a collection of highlights of the group's work, in October of 1985. In 1986, A Classic Case: The London Symphony Orchestra Plays the Music of Jethro Tull was released on record; and Crest of a Knave performed surprisingly well when it was issued in September of 1987, reaching number 19 in England and number 32 in America with the support of a world tour.</p><p>Crest of a Knave was something of a watershed in Tull's later history, though nobody would have guessed it at the time of its release. Although some of its songs displayed the group's usual folk/hard rock mix, the group was playing louder than usual, and tracks like ~Steel Monkey,~ had a harder sound than any previous record by the group. In 1988, Tull toured the United States as part of the celebration of the band's 20th anniversary. In July, Chrysalis issued 20 Years of Jethro Tull, a 65-song boxed-set collection covering the group's history up to that time, containing most of their major songs and augmented with outtakes and radio performances. In February of 1989, the band won the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance for Crest of a Knave. Suddenly, they were stars again, and being declared as relevant by one of the top music awards in the industry; a fact that kept critics buzzing for months over whether the group deserved it before finally attacking the voting for the Grammy Awards and the membership of its parent organization, the National Association of Recording Arts and Sciences.</p><p>Rock Island, another hard rocking album, reached a very healthy number 18 in England during September of the same year, while peaking only at 56 in America, despite a six-week U.S. tour to support the album. In 1990, the album Catfish Rising did less well, reaching only 27 in England and 88 in America after its release in September. And A Little Light Music, their own ~unplugged~ release, taped on their summer 1992 European tour, only got to number 34 in England and 150 in the United States.</p><p>Despite declining numbers, the group continued performing to good-sized houses when they toured, and the group's catalog performed extremely well. In April of 1993, Chrysalis released a four-CD 25th Anniversary Box Set -- evidently hoping that most fans had forgotten the 20th anniversary set issued five years earlier -- consisting of remixed versions of their hits, live shows from across their history, and a handful of new tracks. Meanwhile, Anderson continued to write and record music separate from the group on occasion, most notably Divinities: Twelve Dances with God, a classically-oriented solo album (and a distinctly non-Tull one) on EMI's classical Angel Records. J-Tull.Com followed in 1999.</p>&mdash; <b>Bruce Eder</b>",

When Impulse started out in 1960, John Coltrane and Tyner were the first artists to be signed, and when Impulse was briefly brought back by MCA in the 1980s, two of its most important albums were recordings by Brecker. There are not a lot of surprises on this quartet matchup (with bassist Avery Sharpe and drummer Aaron Scott) except perhaps for how well Tyner and Brecker mesh together. The music is somewhat similar to a set by the pianist's regular trio with a solo piece (~Blues Stride~), a generous amount of Tyner originals and colorful versions of Thelonious Monk's ~I Mean You~ and ~Good Morning Heartache,~ but Brecker's presence and consistently powerful playing does inspire Tyner and his sidemen. For a strong example as to why today's saxophonists have such a high opinion of Michael Brecker, his roaring statement on the extended ~Impressions~ will suffice. Highly recommended.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b></p>"

		"lastname": "U2",
		"name": "U2",
		"biography": "<p>Through a combination of zealous righteousness and post-punk experimentalism, U2 became one of the most popular rock & roll bands of the '80s. Equally known for their sweeping sound as for their grandiose statements about politics and religion, U2 were rock & roll crusaders during an era of synthesized pop and heavy metal. The Edge provided the group with a signature sound by creating sweeping sonic landscapes with his heavily processed, echoed guitars. Though the Edge's style wasn't conventional, the rhythm section of Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. played the songs as driving hard-rock, giving the band a forceful, powerful edge that was designed for arena rock. And their lead singer, Bono, was a frontman who had a knack of grand gestures that played better in arenas than small clubs. It's no accident that footage of Bono parading with a white flag with ~Sunday Bloody Sunday~ blaring in the background became the defining moment of U2's early career — there rarely was a band that believed so deeply in rock's potential for revolution as U2, and there rarely was a band that didn't care if they appeared foolish in the process. During the course of the early '80s, the group quickly built up a dedicated following through constant touring and a string of acclaimed records. By 1987, the band's following had grown large enough to propel them to the level of international superstars with the release of <i>The Joshua Tree</i>. Unlike many of their contemporaries, U2 was able to sustain their popularity in the '90s by reinventing themselves as a post-modern, self-consciously ironic dance-inflected pop-rock act, owing equally to the experimentalism of late '70s Bowie and '90s electronic dance and techno. By performing such a successful reinvention, the band confirmed its status as one of the most popular bands in rock history, in addition to earning additional critical respect.</p><p>With its textured guitars, U2's sound was undeniably indebted to post-punk, so it's slightly ironic that the band formed in 1976, before punk had reached their hometown of Dublin, Ireland. Larry Mullen Jr. (b. October 31, 1961; drums) posted a notice on a high school bulletin board asking for fellow musicians to form a band. Bono (b. Paul Hewson, May 10, 1960; vocals, guitar), the Edge (b. David Evans, August 8, 1961; guitar, keyboards, vocal), Adam Clayton (bass), and Dick Evans responded to the ad, and the group formed as a Beatles and Stone cover band called the Feedback, before changing their name to the Hype in 1977. Shortly afterward, Dick Evans left the band to form the Virgin Prunes. Following his departure, the group changed their name to U2.</p><p>U2's first big break arrived in 1978, when they won a talent contest sponsored by Guinness; the band were in their final year of high school at the time. by the end of the year, the Stranglers' manager Paul McGuinness saw the band play and offered to manage the group. Even with a powerful manager in their corner, the band had trouble making much headway — they failed an audition with CBS Records at the end of the year. In the fall of 1979, U2 released their debut EP U2:3. The EP was available only in Ireland and it topped the national charts. Shortly afterward, they began to play in England, but they failed to gain much attention.</p><p>U2 had one other chart-topping single, ~Another Day,~ in early 1980 before Island Records offered the group a contract. Later that year, the band's debut, <i>Boy</i>, was released. Produced by Steve Lillywhite, the record's sweeping, atmospheric but edgy sound was unlike most of its post-punk contemporaries, and the band earned further attention for its public embrace of Christianity; only Clayton was not a practicing Christian. Through constant touring, including opening gigs for Talking Heads and wet T-shirt contests, U2 was able to take Boy into the American Top 70 in early 1981. <i>October</i>, also produced by Lillywhite, followed in the fall, and it became their British breakthrough, reaching number 11 on the charts. By early 1983, Boy's ~I Will Follow~ and October's ~Gloria~ had become staples on MTV, which, along with their touring, gave the group a formidable cult following in the US.</p><p>Released in the spring of 1983, the Lillywhite-produced <i>War</i> was U2's breakthrough release, entering the UK charts at number one and elevating them into arenas in the United States, where the album peaked at number 12. War had a stronger political message than its predecessors, as evidenced by the UK, college radio, and MTV hits ~Sunday Bloody Sunday~ and ~New Year's Day.~ During the supporting tour, the band filmed their concert at Colorado's Red Rocks Amphitheater, releasing the show as an EP and video title <i>Under A Blood Red Sky</i>. The EP entered in the UK charts at number two, becoming the most successful live recording in British history. U2 had become one of the most popular bands in the world, and their righteous political stance soon became replicated by many other bands, providing the impetus for the Band Aid and Live Aid projects in 1984 and 1985, respectively. For the followup to War, U2 entered the studios with co-producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, who helped give the resulting album an experimental, atmospheric tone. Released in the fall of 1984, <i>The Unforgettable Fire</i> replicated the chart status of War, entering the UK charts at number one and reaching number 12 in the US the album also generated the group's first Top 40 hit in America with the Martin Luther King Jr. tribute ~(Pride) In the Name of Love.~ U2 supported the album with a successful international tour, highlighted by a show-stealing performance at Live Aid. Following the tour, the band released the live EP, <i>Wide Awake in America</i> in 1985.</p><p>While U2 had become one of the most successful rock bands of the '80s, they didn't truly become superstars until the spring 1987 release of <i>The Joshua Tree</i>. Greeted with enthusiastic reviews, many of which proclaimed the album a masterpiece, <i>The Joshua Tree</i> became the band's first American number one hit and its third straight album to enter the UK charts at number one; in England, it set a record by going platinum within 28 hours. Generating the US number one hits ~With or Without You~ and ~I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,~ <i>The Joshua Tree</i> and the group's supporting tour became the biggest success of 1987, earning the group the cover of respected publications like Time magazine. U2 decided to film a documentary about their American tour, recording new material along the way. The project became <i>Rattle & Hum</i>, a film that was supported by a double-album soundtrack that was divided between live tracks and new material. While the album <i>Rattle & Hum</i> was a hit, the record and film received the weakest reviews of U2's career, with many critics taking issue with the group's fascination with American roots music like blues, soul, country and folk. Following the release of <i>Rattle & Hum</i>, the band took an extended hiatus.</p><p>U2 reconvened in Berlin 1990 to record a new album with Eno and Lanois. While the sessions for the album were difficult, the resulting record, <i>Achtung Baby</i>, represented a successful reinvention of the band's trademark sound. Where they had been inspired by post-punk in the early career and American music during their mid-career, U2 delved into electronic and dance music with <i>Achtung Baby</i>. Inspired equally by late '70s Bowie and the Madchester scene in the UK, <i>Achtung Baby</i> was sonically more eclectic and adventurous than U2's earlier work, and it didn't alienate their core audience. The album debuted at number one throughout the world and spawned Top 10 hits with ~Mysterious Ways~ and ~One.~ Early in 1992, the group launched an elaborate tour to support <i>Achtung Baby</i>. Dubbed Zoo TV, the tour was an innovative blend of multi-media electronics, featuring a stage filled with televisions, suspended cars and cellular phone calls. Bono devised an alter-ego called the Fly, which was a knowing send-up of rock stardom. Even under the ironic guise of the Fly and Zoo TV, it was evident that U2 was looser and more fun than ever before, even though they had not abandoned their trademark righteous political anger.</p><p>Following the completion of the American Zoo TV tour in late and before the launch of the European leg of tour, U2 entered the studio to complete an EP of new material that became the full-length <i>Zooropa</i>. Released in the summer of 1993 to coincide with the tour of the same name, <i>Zooropa</i> demonstrated a heavier techno and dance influence than <i>Achtung Baby</i> and it received strong reviews. Nevertheless, the album stalled at sales of two million and failed to generate a big hit single. During the <i>Zooropa</i> tour, the Fly metamorphosed into the demonic MacPhisto, which dominated the remainder of the tour. Upon the completion of the <i>Zooropa</i> tour in late 1993, the band took an extended break. During 1995, U2 re-emerged with ~Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me,~ a glam-rock theme to Batman Forever that was produced by Nellee Hooper (Bjork, Soul II Soul). Later that year, they recorded the collaborative album Original Soundtracks, Vol. 1 with Brian Eno, releasing the album under the name the Passengers late in 1995. It was greeted with a muted reception, both critically and commercially.</p><p>Many hardcore U2 fans, including drummer Larry Mullen Jr., were unhappy with the Passengers project, and U2 promised their next album, to be released in the fall of 1996, would be a rock & roll record. The album took longer to complete than usual, being pushed back to the spring of 1997. During its delay, a few tracks, including the forthcoming first single ~Discotheque,~ were leaked, and it became clear that the new album was going to be heavily influenced by techno, dance and electronic music. When it was finally released, <i>Pop</i> did indeed bear a heavier dance influence, but it was greeted with strong initial sales, as well as some of the strongest reviews of U2's career. In late 1998, the group returned with <i>Best of 1980-1990</i>, the first in a series of hits collections issued in conjunction with a reported $50 million agreement with Polygram. Three years after the mediocre response to <i>Pop</i>, U2 teamed up with Eno and Lanois once again to release <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i> in fall 2000.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>",

Unsurprisingly for a band that always favored the grand statement, the group flourished in such a setting, as this mini-EP attests. Comprised of material recorded in America and Germany, Under a Blood Red Sky draws equally from the band's first three albums, and these live versions, while less textured, are considerably tougher than their studio counterparts and illustrate quite effectively why U2 were considered one of the best, most exhilarating live bands of the '80s.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Using the textured sonics of <i>The Unforgettable Fire</i> as a basis, U2 expanded those innovations by scaling back the songs to a personal setting and adding a grittier attack for its follow-up, <i>The Joshua Tree</i>. It's a move that returns them to the sweeping, anthemic rock of <i>War</i>, but if War was an exploding political bomb, The <i>Joshua Tree</i> is a journey through its aftermath, trying to find sense and hope in the desperation. That means that even the anthems — the epic opener ~Where the Streets Have No Name,~ the yearning ~I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For~ — have seeds of doubt within their soaring choruses, and those fears take root throughout the album, whether it's in the mournful sliding acoustic guitars of ~Running to Stand Still,~ the surging ~One Tree Hill~ or the hypnotic elegy ~Mothers of the Disappeared.~</p><p>So it might seem a little ironic that U2 became superstars on the back of such a dark record, but their focus has never been clearer, nor has their music been catchier, than on The <i>Joshua Tree</i>. Unexpectedly, U2 have also tempered their textural post-punk with American influences. Not only are Bono's lyrics obsessed with America, but country and blues influences are heard throughout the record, and instead of using these as roots, they're used as ways to add texture to the music. With the uniformly excellent songs — only the clumsy, heavy rock and portentous lyrics of ~Bullet the Blue Sky~ fall flat — the result is a powerful, uncompromising record that became a hit due to its vision and its melody. Never before have their big messages sounded so direct and personal.</p> &mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

				"review": "<p>Reinventions rarely come as thorough and effective as Achtung Baby, an album that completely changed U2's sound and style. The crashing, unrecognizable distorted guitars that open ~Zoo Station~ are a clear signal that U2 have traded their Americana pretensions for postmodern, contemporary European music. Drawing equally from Bowie's electronic, avant-garde explorations of the late '70s and the neo-psychedelic sounds of the thriving rave and Madchester club scenes of early-'90s England, Achtung Baby sounds vibrant and endlessly inventive. Unlike their inspirations, U2 rarely experiment with song structures over the course of the album. Instead, they use the thick dance beats, swirling guitars, layers of effects, and found sounds to break traditional songs out of their constraints, revealing the tortured emotional core of their songs with the hyper-loaded arrangements. In such a dense musical setting, it isn't surprising that U2 have abandoned the political for the personal on Achtung Baby, since the music, even with its inviting rhythms, is more introspective than anthemic. Bono has never been as emotionally naked as he is on Achtung Baby, creating a feverish nightmare of broken hearts and desperate loneliness; unlike other U2 albums, it's filled with sexual imagery, much of it quite disturbing, and it ends on a disquieting note. Few bands as far into their career as U2 have recorded an album as adventurous or fulfilled their ambitions quite as successfully as they do on Achtung Baby, and the result is arguably their best album.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>No matter which way you look at it, Pop doesn't have the same shock of the new that Achtung Baby delivered on first listen. Less experimental and more song-oriented than Zooropa, Pop attempts to sell the glitzy rush of techno to an audience weaned on arena rock. And that audience includes U2 themselves. While they never sound like they don't believe in what they're doing, they still remove most of the radical elements of electronic dance, which is evident to anyone with just a passing knowledge of the Chemical Brothers and Underworld. To a new listener, Pop has flashes of surprise -- particularly on the rampaging ~Mofo~ -- but underneath the surface, U2 rely on anthemic rockers and ballads. ~Discotheque~ might be a little clumsy, but ~Staring at the Sun~ shimmers with synthesizers borrowed from Massive Attack and a Noel Gallagher chorus. Similarly, ~Do You Feel Loved~ and ~If You Wear That Velvet Dress~ fuse old-fashioned U2 dynamism with a keen sense of the cool eroticism that makes trip-hop so alluring. Problems arise when the group tries to go for conventional rock songs, some of which are symptomatic of the return of U2's crusade for salvation. Pop is inflected with the desire for a higher power to save the world from its jaded spiral of decay and immorality, which is why the group's embrace of dance music never seems joyous -- instead of providing an intoxicating rush of gloss and glamour, it functions as a backdrop for a plea of salvation. Achtung Baby also was a comment on the numbing isolation of modern culture, but it made sweeping statements through personal observations; Pop makes sweeping statements through sweeping observations. The difference is what makes Pop an easy record to admire, but a hard one to love. </p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

The title signifies more than it seems, since the group sifts through its past, working with Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, all in an effort to construct a classicist U2 album. Thankfully, it's a rock record from a band that absorbed all the elastic experimentation, studio trickery, dance flirtations, and genre bending of Achtung, Zooropa, and Pop -- all they've shed is the irony. U2 choose not to delve as darkly personal as they did on Achtung or Zooropa, yet they also avoid the alienating archness of Pop, returning to the generous spirit that flowed through their best '80s records. On that level, All may be reminiscent of The Joshua Tree, but this is a clever and craftsmanlike record, filled with nifty twists in the arrangements, small sonic details, and colors. U2 take subtle risks, such as their best pure pop song ever with ~Wild Honey~; they're so self-confident they effortlessly write their best anthem in years with ~Beautiful Day~; they offer the gospel-influenced ~Stuck in a Moment,~ never once lowering it to the shtick it would have been on Rattle and Hum. Like any work from craftsmen, All That You Can't Leave Behind winds up being a work of modest pleasures, where the way the verse eases into the chorus means more than the overall message, and this is truly the first U2 album where that sentiment applies -- but there is genuine pleasure in their craft, for the band and listener alike.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

U2 Go Home: Live From Slane Castle marks the joyous return of Ireland's top band at the close of their 2001 Elevation Tour. This DVD, the second video release from the same tour, was filmed in early September at Slane Castle, where U2 previously recorded The Unforgettable Fire. The band's transition from being an opening act in 1981 to a headliner in 2001 helps make this performance special, as does the fact that Ireland had earned a spot in the 2002 World Cup several hours before U2 took the stage. As a result, Live from Slane Castle captures the band at their best, playing a mix of old staples and All That You Can't Leave Behind-era hits to an ecstatic audience that sings along to every word. ~Out of Control~ sounds as sharp as it did in 1980, and ~Beautiful Day~ could possibly be the band's best stadium anthem ever. Spending time with this concert package will leave you grinning from ear to ear -- not only because you like U2 -- but because they've convinced you once again that they're the best rock & roll band in the world. [Bonus interactive material, as well as a digitally remastered version of The Unforgettable Fire documentary, is also included in this DVD set. For those who prefer the audio only, an official bootleg was released in 2007 to members of the band's fan club.]</p><p>&mdash;<strong>MacKenzie Wilson</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>A rock & roll open secret: U2 care very much about what other people say about them. Ever since they hit the big time in 1987 with The Joshua Tree, every album is a response to the last — rather, a response to the response, a way to correct the mistakes of the last album: Achtung Baby erased the roots rock experiment Rattle and Hum, All That You Can't Leave Behind straightened out the fumbling Pop, and 2009's No Line on the Horizon is a riposte to the suggestion they played it too safe on 2004's How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. After recording two new cuts with Rick Rubin for the '06 compilation U218 and flirting with will.i.am, U2 reunited with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois (here billed as ~Danny~ for some reason), who not only produced The Joshua Tree but pointed the group toward aural architecture on The Unforgettable Fire. Much like All That You Can't and Atomic Bomb, which were largely recorded with their first producer, Steve Lillywhite, this is a return to the familiar for U2, but where their Lillywhite LPs are characterized by muscle, the Eno/Lanois records are where the band take risks, and so it is here that U2 attempts to recapture that spacy, mysterious atmosphere of The Unforgettable Fire and then take it further. Contrary to the suggestion of the clanking, sputtering first single ~Get on Your Boots~ — its riffs and ~Pump It Up~ chant sounding like a cheap mashup stitched together in GarageBand — this isn't a garish, gaudy electro-dalliance in the vein of Pop. Apart from a stilted middle section — ~Boots,~ the hamfisted white-boy funk ~Stand Up Comedy,~ and the not-nearly-as-bad-as-its-title anthem ~I'll Go Crazy if I Don't Go Crazy Tonight~; tellingly, the only three songs here to not bear co-writing credits from Eno and Lanois — No Line on the Horizon is all austere grey tones and midtempo meditation. It's a record that yearns to be intimate but U2 don't do intimate, they only do majestic, or as Bono sings on one of the albums best tracks, they do ~Magnificent.~ Here, as on ~No Line on the Horizon~ and ~Breathe,~ U2 strike that unmistakable blend of soaring, widescreen sonics and unflinching openhearted emotion that's been their trademark, turning the intimate into something hauntingly universal. These songs resonate deeper and longer than anything on Atomic Bomb, their grandeur almost seeming effortless. It's the rest of the record that illustrates how difficult it is to sound so magnificent. With the exception of that strained middle triptych, the rest of the album is in the vein of ~No Line on the Horizon~, ~Magnificent~ and ~Breathe,~ only quieter and unfocused, with its ideas drifting instead of gelling. Too often, the album whispers in a murmur so quiet it's quite easy to ignore — ~White as Snow,~ an adaptation of a traditional folk tune, and ~Cedars of Lebanon,~ its verses not much more than a recitation, simmer so slowly they seem to evaporate — but at least these poorly defined subtleties sustain the hazily melancholy mood of No Line on the Horizon. When U2, Eno, and Lanois push too hard — the ill-begotten techno-speak overload of ~Unknown Caller,~ the sound sculpture of ~Fez-Being Born~ — the ideas collapse like a pyramid of cards, the confusion amplifying the aimless stretches of the album, turning it into a murky muddle. Upon first listen, No Line on the Horizon seems as if it would be a classic grower, an album that makes sense with repeated spins, but that repetition only makes the album more elusive, revealing not that U2 went into the studio with a dense, complicated blueprint, but rather, they had no plan at all.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

This newly remastered ~Director's Cut~ edition is a companion to the expanded DVD and features 24-bit encoding on two 24-karat-gold discs, sharpening the sonic clarity of the performances of Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields to near perfection. The performances (which, Marriner notes, crucially served as templates during actual production) have also been augmented to match the expanded new video edition and include a new, 2001 recording of the Adagio in C Minor for Glass Armonica, K. 617.</p><b><I>--Jerry McCulley</I></b>"

				"review": "<p>Peter Gabriel's score for Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, released as the album Passion, was a fair introduction to world music forms for the complete novice, as the music was filtered through Gabriel's more accessible western pop sensibility. The far superior Passion - Sources (the first release on Gabriel's incipient Real World label) presents the original performances that inspired Gabriel's music, and as such is both a handy second step for those intrigued by the soundtrack and an entertaining collection for the more experienced world music fan. Due to the physical location and spiritual themes of the film, Gabriel's source material focuses on the Middle East, northern Africa, and southern Asia and incorporates much religious and ceremonial music. Strict purists have balked about this collection, as it includes one fairly dire piece of Indian pop music by Shankar & the Epidemics, shortens some tracks (most unfortunately, a spine-tingling performance by the great Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, cut from over 11 minutes to not quite five), and overdubs some of Gabriel's musical associates onto others, like Manu Katche's somewhat distracting percussion overdubs on an otherwise enchanting Moroccan wedding song. For most listeners, however, these will be only minor annoyances, and there are plenty of ~purer~ representations of these musics available. Passion - Sources is in most ways an exemplary collection that did much to launch Real World as one of the most viable high-profile world music labels in the world.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stewart Mason</strong></p>"

The album starts out with a Who piece that makes good use of the Bo Diddley beat. An instrumental piece from His Name Is Alive follows. The Who make another appearance with the slower ~Gettin' in Tune,~ and Elvis' ~Pocketful of Rainbows,~ complete with laughing outtakes, allows a lighter moment. Neil Young's thumping ~World on a String~ kicks the energy back up some small amount, before some much lighter work, including Nancy Wilson's contributions specifically made for the movie and Bruce Springsteen's ~Secret Garden.~ Paul McCartney's dual songs are presented afterwards, with a finale of Bob Dylan's ~Shelter From the Storm.~ There's a definite leaning towards the classics of rock & roll here, though the softer side is presented in most cases. As such, it's nice for its coherence, as well as the alternate version of Dylan's song and the outtakes from Elvis.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Adam Greenberg</b></p>"

Organized and executive-produced by Peter Case, this contains covers of the Mississippi bluesman's songs by more than a dozen medium-big and very-big names from the folk and rock worlds, including Beck, Taj Mahal, Bruce Cockburn, Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle (dueting with Justin Earle), Ben Harper, Peter Case & Dave Alvin (performing together), Geoff Muldaur, Gillian Welch, and John Hiatt. It's more a folk-rock-blues crossover album than a Delta blues one, which is fine: tribute albums shouldn't be re-creations of the originals, and whether or not it was the intention, it will expose some of John Hurt's songs to fans who identify themselves primarily as folk or rock listeners. And not many of these songs are very well-known, with the exception of ~Candy Man~ (done by Steve & Justin Earle) and ~Stagolee~ (sung by Beck). The arrangements are low-key and respectful, the best ones being Ben Harper's ~Sliding Delta~ (which is one of the bluesiest performances) and Victoria Williams' ~Since I've Laid My Burden Down,~ which has very eccentric banjo sounds.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Richie Unterberger</b></p>"

Instead, he divided the film into chapters, giving him opportunity to play with both time and location, and then decided to shoot each chapter as a homage to a different kind of exploitation film — something that's reflected in the soundtrack. After Nancy Sinatra's torchy ~Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)~ and Charlie Feathers' tough, swaggering rockabilly chestnut ~That Certain Female~ set the story and the mood, the record is devoted primarily to instrumental pieces that range from surging epics to the calm kitsch of Zamfir's ~The Lonely Shepherd,~ to the intense funk pastiche of Tomoyasu Hotei's ~Battle Without Honor or Humanity~ (the song that kicks off nearly every trailer and ad for <I>Kill Bill</I>).</p><p>The reduced presence of dialogue from the film — a hallmark of Tarantino  soundtracks — is a reflection of the film, which places emphasis on action and visuals. Hell, even the tracks on the soundtrack have minimal lyrics, consisting largely of instrumentals. This gives it more of a meandering feeling, and the soundtrack kind of peters out, ending in two quick excerpts of futuristic electro music by Quincy Jones  and Neu!, then a gaggle of sound effects and kung fu hits. Nevertheless, its cavalcade of contradictory moods has its own coherence, and is more <I>musical</I> than most pop music soundtracks. Plus, this has <I>no</I> familiar material, nor does it have anything that would be a single on Clear Channel, which is why it works as an album of its own — it doesn't just reflect the movie; it follows its own logic, and displays fearless imagination. It makes you hungry for <I>Vol. 2</I>, both the movie and soundtrack. — <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B></p>"

So he naturally turned to the extremely efficient publishing houses of Amsterdam for his collections of concertos opus 3 (<I>L'estro armonico</I>, 1711) and 4 (<I>La stravaganza</I>, 1714), among others. Success was not long in coming - both he and the Venetian concerto of which he was the mosy brilliant representative quickly achieved fame all over Europe. To such an extent that very soon, at the little German court of Saxe-Weimar, a young <I>Kapellmeister</I> by the name of Johan Sebastian Bach studied them carefully, even transcribing for harpsichord some of the finest specimens, which were to inspire him in his own compositions... The scene is set for this appealing new CD by Rinaldo Alessandrini, whose Vivaldian and Bachian credentials need no underlining: one need only recall his splendid recital of Bach's harpsichord music ~<I>all'italiana</I>~. Here, with his ensemble Concerto Italiano (which celebrates its twentieth anniversary in 2005), not content with presenting the original versions of four magnificent concertos that attracted the attention of Bach the transcriber (two of them composed by talented Marcello brothers), not to mention the celebrated flute concerto <I>La notte</I>,&nbsp;Alessandrini offers us the added bonus of his own reconstruction of Bach's ~Italian Concerto~ in what may have been its first version, now lost. Thus the masterpiece for solo harpsichord here becomes a ~real~ concerto for violon and strings, whose leaping vigour and exemplary transparency are totally convincing. Here is the transcriber transcribed - with delightful results!</SPAN></P><P><HR><BR>The Baroque era? Just a bunch of dead guys' dead music. It was three centuries ago, for example, that Bach transcribed some Venetian violin concertos into works for solo harpsichord. (Big deal.) But what if you reversed the process? What if you turned Bach's harpsichord piece ~after the Italian taste~ into a violin concerto and restored the lost violin parts of some of Bach's transcriptions? Presto, you'd have some brand-new Baroque music, thematically arranged.<BR>Concerto Italiano and its director, Rinaldo Alessandrini, have done just that -- and created marvels. Listen for the use of staccato and silence in the two slow movements of Benedetto Marcello's second Concerti a cinque; the contrast between the serene Adagio and the festive Presto in his brother Alessandro's exquisite oboe concerto; and the second of Vivaldi's amazingly innovative flute concertos, with its creepy ~Night~ and hypnotic ~Sleep~ sections.<BR>In 2003, Gramophone declared that Concerto Italiano's version of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons was the finest ever recorded. The pristine Naive Classique recording of Concerti Italiani will similarly raise your spirits -- along with those of a few dead guys.<BR>-Michael Bowen<BR><I>The Inlander</I>, Spokane, Washington - November 2004 (USA)<BR><BR><HR>&nbsp;<BR><P><B><A href=~http://www.andante.com/boutique/shop/index.cfm?action=displaycatalog&amp;iProductLabelID=&amp;by=composer&amp;iConcPeopleID=1767&amp;vFirstName=Benedetto&amp;vLastName=Marcello&amp;vSection=Benedetto%20Marcello~><FONT color=#000000>Benedetto Marcello</FONT></A></B><BR>1-4 Concerto in mi minore per violino obligato, violoncello, archi e basso continuo (<I>concerti a cinque</I>, op.I, Venezia, 1708) 10:18 <BR><P>-ricostruzione della parte di violino obbligato a cura di Rinaldo Alessandrini -</P><BR>Recorded in September 2000 in Chiesa della SS.

No other locally produced programme has ever continually drawn out of musicians such intimate, occasionally raw, yet always unique performances.</p><p>These performances covering a diverse range of both local and international musicians and musical styles- What other album would have the biggest Australian band in the world today - Jet, alongside one of Australia's great Indie talents John Butler Trio and internationally acclaimed David Gray, Jamie Cullum and Joe Cocker!</p><p>What is the common thread that links all these performances together? - THE PANEL's Rob Sitch says. ~I think all performers like the chance to be ~Unplugged~. Occasionally this happened mid-song and against their will and for that we apologise. We'll gaffer tape the cables next year.~.</p><p>TV being a technical medium so many variables can come into play to sabotage a performance no matter how well rehearsed and prepared it may be! Maybe it was the vibe emanating from The Panel regulars whose respect for all of their guests puts them at ease, or the intimate set where the studio audience is almost within touching distance. Maybe it was the policy that absolutely no compromises would be made when providing each of the musicians with the best possible sound. Whatever the reason, the many acts who appear on The Panel, without exception, turn in outstanding performances on the night, and have preserved for us on this 4th CD, indelible moments of their musical talent.</p>"

The kitsch factor dominating the rest of said series is basically gone with all the bands here simply doing unplugged versions of fan's favorite songs, and the record is the predictable result of pop-punkers turning off their amps and adding in the occasional piano and handclap for good measure. Fans of acts like Silverstein and the Audition will be smitten all the way through, though really, some songs work much better than others, stripped down and without the driving chords to cover up oft-nasal vocals. Jack's Mannequin's ~Bruised~ is unsurprisingly a standout, since Andrew McMahon is heads above his peers anyways, but newcomers All Time Low bring an unexpectedly solid performance by doing, well, absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. Mixing up the emo-heavy crowd a bit, Set Your Goals' great ~Echoes~ stands tall as a punchy little melodic hardcore number that recalls early New Found Glory, while vets Anti-Flag can barely contain their anger at the Bush administration over the strummed notes of ~Welcome to 1984.~ These songs — along with a rather whimsical version of Say Anything's ~Woe~ and a laid-back, barebones All-American Rejects number — are welcome respite from the album's generally consistent nature, not to mention the grating screamo-lite of Alesana and a rather boring cut from Sherwood. Perfectly inoffensive and agreeable ~punk~ ready for late-night make-out sessions between a boy and girl most likely wearing the same sized jeans.</P><P>— <B>Corey Apar</B></P>"

				"review": "<p>Between 1971 and 1987, BBC television's The Old Grey Whistle Test was crucial viewing for any ~serious~ rock fan, a weekly digest of live performance, concert footage, interviews, and news, presented for most of that run by the gently bearded whisper of DJ Bob Harris. It was never a show that chased headlines -- although Whistle Test can claim to have launched some of the most incandescent talents of the early '70s, from Alice Cooper, who made his first U.K. TV appearance on the show, to Focus, hitherto an unknown Dutch prog act, it was just as notable for the acts it didn't feature as for those it did. No ~pop~ groups, no Top 40 hypes, nothing that at least one member of the production team wouldn't trust with his life. The result, though the show itself drifted in and out of critical and public favor throughout its 16-year run, is today regarded among the most crucial British rock archives in existence, and the two DVDs that comprise this package highlight at least a fraction of the jewels therein. The 45 exclusive performances stretching across the show's entire run do indeed include the most epochal showings, with the first disc traveling through the first half of the 1970s, a gold mine of thinking man's rock -- Focus, of course, whipping up a frenzied (and festive) ~Hocus Pocus,~ show favorites the Sensational Alex Harvey Band hamming it up with ~Give My Compliments to the Chef,~ the Wailers' spellbinding romp through ~Stir It Up,~ and an absolutely epic rendition of ~Frankenstein~ from the Edgar Winter Group.</p> <p>There's room, too, for a couple of the bands that Harris himself furiously fought against including on the show, only to be outvoted by his teammates -- nobody who saw them will ever forget the scorn and disgust with which the staid and serious Harris introduced the decidedly glamorous novelty of Roxy Music and the New York Dolls, and there's a school of thought that actually credits his outrage with laying the foundations of punk rock a few years later. Harris represented the establishment; Roxy (and the Dolls) were the future. If you liked one, you couldn't trust the other. Harris himself had departed Whistle Test by the time the show itself was ready to embrace punk -- he presided over a handful more begrudging nods in that direction, including the blistering performances from Dr. Feelgood and Otway & Barrett that appear here, but it was with the arrival of hostess Annie Nightingale that the show (and this collection) moved into the new age. Talking Heads, XTC, Blondie, the Damned, Public Image, and the Teardrop Explodes all highlight disc two, although there's still room for the traditional Whistle Test audience. Meat Loaf turned in a phenomenal ~Paradise By the Dashboard Lights,~ there's some stunning footage of Bruce Springsteen, Robert Wyatt turns in a heartbreaking ~Shipbuilding,~ and R.E.M. -- possibly the one band in the '80s that wholly epitomized the spirit of the show in the '70s -- takes a suitably po-faced trip down ~Moon River.~ Bonus material includes personal recollections from the show's hosts (a wealth of entertaining trivia) and a clutch of interviews from the show's golden years: Lennon, Led Zeppelin, Keith Richard, Elton John. In addition, producer Mike Appleton delivers a vastly enjoyable audio commentary, while there's also a smattering of still-photo features. At the end of the day, though, it's the music that made The Old Grey Whistle Test what it was, and the music -- close to five hours of it -- that renders this collection such an essential document.</p>&mdash; <b>Dave Thompson</b>"

		"lastname": "Vaughan",
		"name": "Stevie Ray Vaughan",
		"biography": "<p>With his astonishingly accomplished guitar playing, Stevie Ray Vaughan ignited the blues revival of the '80s. Vaughan drew equally from bluesmen like Albert King, Otis Rush, and Muddy Waters and rock & roll players like Jimi Hendrix and Lonnie Mack, as well as the stray jazz guitarist like Kenny Burrell, developing a uniquely eclectic and fiery style that sounded like no other guitarist, regardless of genre. Vaughan bridged the gap between blues and rock like no other artist had since the late '60s. For the next seven years, Stevie Ray was the leading light in American blues, consistently selling out concerts while his albums regularly went gold. His tragic death in 1990 only emphasized his influence in blues and American rock & roll.</p><p>Born and raised in Dallas, Vaughan began playing guitar as a child, inspired by older brother Jimmie. When he was in junior high school, he began playing in a number of garage bands, which occasionally landed gigs in local nightclubs. By the time he was 17, he had dropped out of high school to concentrate on playing music. Vaughan's first real band was the Cobras, who played clubs and bars in Austin during the mid-'70s. Following that group's demise, he formed Triple Threat in 1975. Triple Threat also featured bassist Jackie Newhouse, drummer Chris Layton, and vocalist Lou Ann Barton. After a few years of playing Texas bars and clubs, Barton left the band in 1978. The group decided to continue performing under the name Double Trouble, which was inspired by the Otis Rush song of the same name; Vaughan became the band's lead singer.</p><p>For the next few years, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble played the Austin area, becoming one of the most popular bands in Texas. In 1982, the band played the Montreux Festival and their performance caught the attention of David Bowie and Jackson Browne. After Double Trouble's performance, Bowie asked Vaughan to play on his forthcoming album, while Browne offered the group free recording time at his Los Angeles studio, Downtown; both offers were accepted. Stevie Ray laid down the lead guitar tracks for what became Bowie's Let's Dance album in late 1982. Shortly afterward, John Hammond, Sr. landed Vaughan and Double Trouble a record contract with Epic, and the band recorded its debut album in less than a week at Downtown.</p><p>Vaughan's debut album, Texas Flood, was released in the summer of 1983, a few months after Bowie's Let's Dance appeared. On its own, Let's Dance earned Vaughan quite a bit of attention, but Texas Flood was a blockbuster blues success; receiving positive reviews in both blues and rock publications, reaching number 38 on the charts, and crossing over to album rock radio stations. Bowie offered Vaughan the lead guitarist role for his 1983 stadium tour, but he turned him down, preferring to play with Double Trouble. Vaughan and Double Trouble set off on a successful tour and quickly recorded their second album, Couldn't Stand the Weather, which was released in May of 1984. The album was more successful than its predecessor, reaching number 31 on the charts; by the end of 1985, the album went gold. Double Trouble added keyboardist Reese Wynans in 1985, before they recorded their third album, Soul to Soul. The record was released in August 1985 and was also quite successful, reaching number 34 on the charts.</p><p>Although his professional career was soaring, Vaughan was sinking deep into alcoholism and drug addiction. Despite his declining health, Vaughan continued to push himself, releasing the double live album Live Alive in October of 1986 and launching an extensive American tour in early 1987. Following the tour, Vaughan checked into a rehabilitation clinic. The guitarist's time in rehab was kept fairly quiet, and for the next year Stevie Ray and Double Trouble were fairly inactive. Vaughan performed a number of concerts in 1988, including a headlining gig at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and wrote his fourth album. The resulting record, In Step, appeared in June of 1989 and became his most successful album, peaking at number 33 on the charts, earning a Grammy for Best Contemporary Blues Recording, and going gold just over six months after its release.</p><p>In the spring of 1990, Stevie Ray recorded an album with his brother Jimmie, which was scheduled for release in the fall of the year. In the late summer of 1990, Vaughan and Double Trouble set out on an American headlining tour. On August 26, 1990, their East Troy, WI, gig concluded with an encore jam featuring guitarists Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, Jimmie Vaughan, and Robert Cray. After the concert, Stevie Ray boarded a helicopter bound for Chicago. Minutes after its 12:30 a.m. takeoff, the helicopter crashed, killing Vaughan and the other four passengers. He was only 35 years old.</p><p>Family Style, Stevie Ray's duet album with Jimmie, appeared in October and entered the charts at number seven. Family Style began a series of posthumous releases that were as popular as the albums Vaughan released during his lifetime. The Sky Is Crying, a collection of studio outtakes compiled by Jimmie, was released in October of 1991; it entered the charts at number ten and went platinum three months after its release. In the Beginning, a recording of a Double Trouble concert in 1980, was released in the fall of 1992 and the compilation Greatest Hits was released in 1995. In 1999, Vaughan's original albums were remastered and reissued, with The Real Deal: Greatest Hits, Vol. 2 also appearing that year. 2000 saw the release of the four-disc box SRV, which concentrated heavily on outtakes, live performances, and rarities.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>",

Vaughan may have been the new news, but King was not suffering, either. He had a world-class supporting band and was playing as well as he ever had. In other words, the stage was set for a fiery, exciting concert and that's exactly what they delivered. Vaughan was clearly influenced by King -- there are King licks all over his first two recorded efforts, and it was an influence that stayed with him to the end -- and he was unafraid to go toe-to-toe with his idol. King must have been impressed, since In Session never devolves into a mere cutting contest. Instead, each musicians spurs the other to greater heights. For aficionados of either guitarist, that means the album isn't just worth a listen -- it means that it's a record that sounds as exciting on each subsequent listen as does the first time through.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

The 1982 show is essentially the show that got his career started. He met both Jackson Browne and David Bowie after his set, and they were so impressed that Browne volunteered use of his studio (for free!) for Stevie to record what would become his debut album, and Bowie recruited him as lead guitarist for the Let's Dance album and tour (alas, the tour was not to be). However, not everyone was so impressed. In fact, there are choruses of boos that follow nearly every tune. Vaughan was basically a nobody at the time, playing very electric blues at the end of a mostly acoustic program. But he had done enough bar gigs to completely rise above it, and he plays with the passion and hunger of a young musician getting his big chance. He's not really an engaging frontman at this point in his career, but man, can he play that guitar. And he simply never lets up. Even at this stage, his tone and style are pretty close to fully formed, and it's easy to see how he could become the guitar hero he ended up being.</p><p>The 1985 show is quite a contrast. Vaughan had become a star, and it shows in so many ways. He had developed more of a stage persona, with showier moves and infinitely more presence as a frontman. He's also dressed to the hilt, looking like some sort of '80s cowboy-pimp with a ridiculous hat, multiple scarfs, and gigantic earring. Heck, even Whipper Layton is sporting fancier '80s pants and a big earring, and Tommy Shannon's hat is more extravagant than the 1982 show as well. Double Trouble also now included Reese Wynans on keyboards, which, along with Vaughan's addition of a wah-wah pedal, really expanded the sound. Vaughan has many fiery moments on this set as well, but he also loses focus during several solos, and seems more than content to share or even hand over the spotlight to fellow Texas guitar legend Johnny Copeland. Vaughan seems a bit worn out, and it wouldn't be long before he got sober. Even so, there are clear moments of brilliance and this time the audience is fully behind him. Live at Montreux 1982 & 1985 is a vital document for fans, showing the raw ingredients that would make him a star, then comparing it to what happened once he got there. The video is great, with multiple angles throughout (except for the encore of the 1985 set) and there are many excellent close-ups of his playing. It's a great look at the rise of one of rock's most revered guitar players.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Sean Westergaard</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>By adding two members to Double Trouble -- keyboardist Reese Wynans and saxophonist Joe Sublett -- Stevie Ray Vaughan indicated he wanted to add soul and R&B inflections to his basic blues sound, and Soul to Soul does exactly that. It's still a modern blues album, yet it has a wider sonic palette, finding Vaughan fusing a variety of blues, rock, and R&B styles. Most of this is done through covers -- notably Hank Ballard's ~Look at Little Sister,~ the exquisitely jazzy ~Gone Home,~ and Doyle Bramhall's impassioned soul-blues ~Change It~ -- but Vaughan's songwriting occasionally follows suit, as well. Even if only the tortured blues wailer ~Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love~ entered his acknowledged canon, he throws in some delightful soul-funk touches on ~Say What!,~ the instrumental wah-wah workout that kicks off the album, and the Curtis Mayfield-inspired closer, ~Life Without You,~ captures Vaughan at his best as a composer and performer. It's such a seductive number -- such a full realization of his soul-blues ambitions -- that the rest of the album pales in comparison. In fact, for all of its positive attributes, Soul to Soul winds up being less than the sum of its parts, and it's hard to pinpoint an exact reason why. Perhaps it was because Vaughan was on the verge of a horrible battle with substance abuse at the time of recording or perhaps it just has that unevenness inherent in transitional albums. Still, he has good taste in covers, his originals are sturdy, and there's not a bad performance here, so Soul to Soul winds up enjoyable in spite of its flaws, and it clearly points the way to his 1989 masterpiece, In Step.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Stevie Ray Vaughan had always been a phenomenal guitarist, but prior to In Step, his songwriting was hit or miss. Even when he wrote a classic modern blues song, it was firmly within the genre's conventions; only on Soul to Soul's exquisite soul-blues ~Life Without You~ did he attempt to stretch the boundaries of the form. As it turns out, that was the keynote for In Step, an album where Vaughan found his own songwriting voice, blending blues, soul, and rock in unique ways, and writing with startling emotional honesty. Yes, there are a few covers, all well chosen, but the heart of the album rests in the songs he co-wrote with Doyle Bramhall, the man who penned the Soul to Soul highlight ~Change It.~ Bramhall proved to be an ideal collaborator for Vaughan; tunes like the terse ~Tightrope~ and the dense ~Wall of Denial~ feel so intensely personal, it's hard to believe that they weren't the product of just one man. Yet the lighter numbers -- the dynamite boogie ~The House Is Rockin'~ and the breakneck blues of ~Scratch-n-Sniff~ -- are just as effective as songs. Of course, he didn't need words to make effective music: ~Travis Walk~ is a blistering instrumental, complete with intricate fingerpicking reminiscent of the great country guitarist Merle Travis, while the shimmering ~Riviera Paradise~ is every bit as lyrical and lovely as his previous charmer, ~Lenny.~ The magnificent thing about In Step is how it's fully realized, presenting every facet of Vaughan's musical personality, yet it still soars with a sense of discovery. It's a bittersweet triumph, given Vaughan's tragic death a little over a year after its release, yet it's a triumph all the same.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

It's not so much a best-of or career retrospective as a very generous pile of career-spanning material that will genuinely add a new dimension to the Stevie Ray Vaughan listener's library, as fully two-thirds of the 54 tracks were previously unreleased. In addition, of the songs that have been previously available, five of those are cuts on which Vaughan was a sideman or partner (for Johnny Copeland, Albert King, Lonnie Mack, A.C. Reed, and as part of the Vaughan Brothers), so the Vaughan collector might have missed those in the past. Each of the first three discs clock in at more than 75 minutes, progressing from 1977 to 1990 and emphasizing live material, from soundchecks and radio programs to arena-headlining gigs and three solo acoustic tunes (one of which was previously on The Unplugged Collection, Vol. 1) from a 1990 MTV Unplugged episode. As music, though, it's uneven. The earliest and leanest cuts are a valuable supplement to Vaughan's discography, since he didn't have much opportunity to record until the early '80s. Yet sometimes these are too-long shuffles and boogies; his songwriting and singing is not nearly as impressive as his instrumental technique; and his occasional attempts to replicate Jimi Hendrix are inessential. A few familiar popular studio cuts like ~Pride and Joy~ and ~Wall of Denial~ are here, presumably to entertain the more casual Vaughan fans who need an extra push to spring for the box. More rabid Vaughan followers will likely be so overwhelmed by the quantity of unreleased items that they're unlikely to quibble about the presence of tracks they already own. The fourth disc is a DVD with five never-aired and never-issued performances from an episode of the television program Austin City Limits, recorded on October 10, 1989; the 72-page booklet of essays, appreciative quotes from several dozen peers, and more are other bonuses.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

A sometime leader, his bass dances and skitters around an ensemble as a co-equal member of the front line, and he makes very creative use of the bow. He is influenced not only by bassists like Scott LaFaro, Ron Carter and Gary Peacock, but also by Czech folk music.</p><p>Vitous began his musical studies on the violin at age six, switching to piano from ages nine to fourteen before finally settling upon the bass. While studying at the Prague Conservatory, he played with a trio that included his brother Alan on drums and Jan Hammer -- another future jazz-rock mover and shaker -- on piano. After winning a scholarship to Berklee in 1966, he moved to New York the following year and wound up working with Art Farmer, Freddie Hubbard, Bob Brookmeyer, Clark Terry, and very briefly, Miles Davis.</p><p>Now one of the most highly touted prodigies in jazz, Vitous started playing in a recurring trio with Chick Corea and Roy Haynes on Corea's 1968 album Now He Sings, Now He Sobs. He then joined one of Herbie Mann's most popular groups from 1968 until 1970, with time out for a tour with Stan Getz; Mann produced his first album, a pioneering series of extended jazz-rock workouts called Infinite Search on the flutist's Embryo label. As a founding member of Weather Report, Vitous helped define the band's freewheeling initial stage, leaving the group in late 1973 as its music began to evolve into more structured forms. A move to Los Angeles in 1974 led to a year-long session of woodshedding in private with a new custom-made instrument, a double-necked guitar and bass. However, that experiment did not pan out, and he returned to the bass, leading sessions for Warner Bros., Arista, and from 1979, a sporadic series of dates for ECM as a leader and in reunions of Corea's bop-to-free Trio Music group.</p><p>In the meantime, Vitous became immersed in academia, joining the faculty of the New England Conservatory in 1979 and becoming head of the jazz department in 1983. Although his profile isn't nearly as high as it was at the height of the jazz-rock era, he continued to play at jazz festivals and record into the 1990s.</p>&mdash; <b>Richard S. Ginell</b>",

Vitous, who has been through every music, from jazz-rock fusion as a founding member of Weather Report to being a classical composer, decided to revisit the skeletal remains of his very first session for the label in 1969. Produced by Herbie Mann the disc was, from a musical standpoint, a contentious, utterly brilliant marriage of ideas both old and new. Bandmembers DeJohnette and McLaughlin were present on those sides as well.</p><p>Universal Syncopations is by turns a return to not the old forms, but rather to the manner of illustrating harmonic concepts in a quintet setting that allows for a maximum space between ensemble players while turning notions of swing, counterpoint, and rhythmic invention on their heads. From the wooly, expressionistic ~Tramp Blues,~ with Vitous vamping around the changes, to the wide-open legato guitar phrasing of McLauglin against the double time in Vitous' bass on ~Univoyage,~ to the simmering undulations of Garbarek's saxophones on top of Corea's intricate melodies and right-hand runs on ~Brazilan Waves,~ all of it propelled, not anchored, by the leader's rich tone and accented and punctuated by Garbarek's tight, loping saxophone lines. This is one of those recordings that feels familiar in tone, but is timeless in concept and execution. Universal Syncopations is one of the most gorgeous sounding and toughly played dates of the calendar year.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

				"review": "<p>At this stage of the game, any new Tom Waits record is an event. Listening through the music of his entire career is daunting, to say the least, but it's a journey no one else, with the possible exception of Bob Dylan, has taken before. If one listens to the official recordings, from 1973's Closing Time, featuring the songs of an itinerant Beat barroom singer (no lounges please), right on through to the frenetic mania of 2004's Real Gone, one becomes aware of not only the twists and turns of a songwriter wrestling and bellowing at and with his muse, but of a journeyman artist barely able to hold on to the lid of his creativity, let alone keep it on. True, there have been many stops along the way: in the seediest lounges (1977's Foreign Affairs, which could have been a twisted inspiration to novelist Phillip Kerr when he wrote the Berlin Noir trilogy); acid-drenched blues scree (1980's Heartattack and Vine); travelogues of the unseen and the unspeakable (1985's Rain Dogs); seething and murderous suburban nightmares (1987's Franks Wild Years); the frighteningly comic tales of plagues and carnivals (1993's Black Rider); the scrape, squeal, and hollowed-out metal crunch of urban junkyards and classically American paranoia (1999's Mule Variations); and through-the-mirror-darkly image nightmares and fairy tale variations (2002's Alice and Blood Money). All of it is contained in the man who takes delight in the bent, quarreling marriage of song and sound with dangerously comic imagery.</p><p>Orphans is the most unwieldy Tom Waits collection yet. Packaged in a Cibachrome-tinted box are three discs containing 56 songs total. It claims 30 new tunes, but a mere 14 can be found on other records — six othersd have to be hunted for while the remainder have shown up in various incarnationson soundtracks, compilations, etc. This crazy thing began as a collection of outtakes, rarities, soundtrack tunes, and compilation-only cuts — some of which survive here in new form, including tracks from the Ramblin' Jack Elliot tribute, the Bridge benefit, and two Ramones covers, to name a few. In other words, the first conception for this mess was as a hodgepodge collection of attic material. Waits checked out the tune selection as it was and said something like ~nah, bad idea; this would suck.~ So, he did what any self-respecting artist with a head full of ideas, two stomping, shuffling feet, and itchy fingers — and time on his hands — would do: he recorded new songs and re-recorded others, so the thing would have some kind of elasticity yet hold its rickety bone and far-reaching sources together by means of cheap glue, chewed gum, solder, and a visionary recording engineer named Karl Derfler.</p><p>The end result is this daunting triple disc divided by title and theme: disc one is ~Brawlers,~ Waits' rock and blues record, evoking everyone from T. Rex and Johnny Burnette to Sonny Curtis and Howlin' Wolf. It's a grand thing, since he hasn't released one like this before — the closest were Heartattack and Vine on one side and Mule Variations on the other. Travel, regret, murder, salvation, guttersnipe meditations on sorrow, and nefarious and broken-down innocent — and nefarious — amorous intentions are a few of the themes that run through these tunes like oil and sand. Disc two is ~Bawlers,~ a collection of ballads, raw love songs, weepy wine tunes, wistful yet tentative hope — in the form of floppy prayers — and an under-the-table and wishing, bewildered, yet dead-on topical tome on the world's political situation. Disc three, entitled ~Bastards,~ is even edgier; it's Waits hanging out there with his music and muse on the lunatic fringe of experimentation. Think Bone Machine's wilder moments and Waits' loopy standup comedy in the form of six spoken word pieces included here. Thank goodness he finally did this. If you've ever seen the man on a stage, you'll get why these are so important immediately.<p>~Brawler~ digs deep into the American roots music that has obsessed Waits since the beginning of his long labyrinthine haul. There's the frenetic rockabilly swagger that probably makes Carl Perkins and Gene Vincent shake and shimmy in their graves. One of the movie tunes, a cover of ~Sea of Love,~ recalls its place in the film for those who've seen it. If you haven't, it's a slanted, tarnished jewel freshly liberated from antiquity. The hobo ballad ~Bottom of the World~ recalls old country gospel, and ~Lucinda~ can only be described as a gallows dance tune. The slippery hoodoo blues ~Road to Peace~ is the season's most timely and topical political song.</p><p>~Bawlers~ is the set's bridge, and it's easy to see why: it's the most accessible disc in the box. There are some of the movie tunes here, from flicks like Pollock, Big Bad Love, and Shrek 2. Other cuts, such as ~Goodnight Irene,~ recall ~Tom Traubert's Blues (Four Sheets to the Wind in Copenhagen)~ from the Small Change album; the singing protagonist here is older and more desperate, almost suicidal. Resignation displaces hope; it's a long reach into the past and expresses the void of the present. The cover of the Ramones' ~Danny Says~ is completely reinvented; it's one of the loneliest, most sweetly desolate of Waits' many sides. It's not all darkness, however; there are gorgeous songs here too, such as ~Never Let Go~ and ~You Can Never Hold Back Spring,~ where an indomitable human spirit reins and rings true.</p><p>Finally, it comes down to ~Bastards.~ The eerie, strange, cabaret-in-a-carnival music that is Weill and Brecht's ~What Keeps Mankind Alive~ enlists banjos, accordion, tuba, and big bass drum as simply the means to let these twisted words out of the box. Thankfully the cover of ~Books of Moses,~ originally by Skip Spence, is here, as is Daniel Johnston's ~King Kong.~ Neither of these cuts resembles their original version, and Waits brings out the dark underbelly inherent in each. ~Bedtime Story~ is the first of the Waits monologues here. It is the repressed wish of every parent (with a sense of humor) to have the temerity to tell this kind of tale to their children when they retire. Others include a reading of Charles Bukowski's ~Nirvana,~ the hilarious monologue ~The Pontiac,~ and the live routine ~Dog Door.~ Perhaps the most inviting cut here is the piano-and-horn ballad ~Altar Boy,~ a postmodern saloon song that would make Bobby Short turn red with rage. This disc is the true mixed bag in the set: unruly, uneven, and full of feints and free-for-alls.</p><p>Ultimately, the epicenter of Orphans is Waits' voice. It's many expressions, nuances, bellows, barks, hollers, open wails, roughshod croons, and midnight whispers carry these songs and monologues to the listener with authority as an open invitation into his sound world, his view of tradition, and his manner of shaping that world as something not ephemeral, but as an extension of musical time itself. As a vocalist, Waits, like Bob Dylan, embodies the entire genealogical line of the blues, jazz, local barroom bards, and traveling minstrels in the very grain of his songs. That wily throat carries not only the songs he and his songwriting partner and wife, Kathleen Brennan, pen, but also the magnet for the sonic atmospheres that frame it. There is adventure, danger, and the sound of the previous, the forgotten, and the wished for in it. And it is that voice that links all three of these discs together and makes them partners. One cannot dismiss that even though some of these songs have appeared elsewhere, Orphans is a major work that goes beyond the origins of the material and drags everything past and present with sound and texture into a present to be presented as something utterly new, beyond anything he has previously issued. To paraphrase Ezra Pound in response to Allen Ginsberg's inquiry about what his poem ~The Cantos~ meant, these orphans speak for themselves.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b></p>"

He was born Ronald Clyde Crosby in upstate New York and recorded his first several albums while living in New York City. He didn't move to Austin until 1971, but he's remained a major figure in the area ever since. Walker has been quoted as saying, ~the first time I set foot in Texas, particularly in Austin, I knew I was home.~</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/jjw-mr-bojangles.jpg~ alt=~Mr. Bojangles~><p>Walker first recorded with the folk-rock group Circus Maximus for Vanguard in 1967. The band split after its second album, and Walker signed with Atco and released his first solo album, Mr. Bojangles, in 1968. He is, for better or worse, best known as the writer of ~Mr. Bojangles,~ an enduring pop classic he wrote after meeting former tap dancer and street singer Bill ~Bojangles~ Robinson in a New Orleans drunk tank. His version of ~Bojangles~ never hit it big, but the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's rendition made the Top Ten of the pop charts in 1971.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/jjw-viva.jpg~ alt=~Viva Terlingua~><p>Viva TerlinguaIn 1972, Walker signed with Decca/MCA and released a self-titled album that included his version of Guy Clark's ~L.A. Freeway,~ and ~That Old Time Feeling,~ along with his own ~Hill Country Rain,~ his reputation for being a ~gypsy songman~ found its roots in this outing. His best-known album from the period, however, is Viva Terlingua, which he recorded in 1973 in the tiny Texas town of Luckenbach with the Lost Gonzo Band. The album went gold, and was his biggest-selling album to date. His subsequent recordings of the '70s, particularly It's a Good Night for Singin', Ridin' High, and A Man Must Carry On solidified Walker's reputation for being not only a great songwriter, but a wonderful interpreter of the work of his peers, and for being the greatest example of the living embodiment of ~cosmic cowboyism.~</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/jjw-jerry-jeff.jpg~ alt=~Jerry Jeff~><p>Walker was a hard drinker throughout much of his career (his friends called him ~Jacky Jack~), and this reputation became part of his identity. He's since cleaned up his act -- in part thanks to his wife, Susan, whom he married in 1974 -- and he's continued to record steadily into the 2000s. He released a couple albums on Elektra/Asylum in the late '70s, but remained mostly with MCA until his 1982 album Cowjazz -- a record that became his last for any major label. The Elektra recordings, Jerry Jeff and Too Old to Change, were undervalued during their heyday, and have proven to be among his most adventurous and enduring recordings thanks to a Wounded Bird two-fer CD reissue in 2003. Walker, as evidenced by these recordings, was the only one of his peers -- with the possible exception of Willie Nelson -- who unrelentingly sought change and development in his sound. It didn't help with a country music industry completely hoodwinked by (sub)urban cowboyism and a pop market less receptive to organic American music than at any time in its history. In 1985, however, he showed the industry he could live without their help and released the first of a series of self-made cassettes, Gypsy Songman, many of which he sold via a mailing list that had grown to more than 40,000 strong. In 1987, Walker worked out a deal with Rykodisc, which released his CDs until 1996 when their partnership ended. He has since continued to market his material on Tried & True through his website and live shows. While Walker's Tried & True issues have not been as critically well-regarded as his earlier work, they are compelling, occasionally brilliant, always written from the perspective of where his gypsy songman is at this particular musical moment.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/jjw-viva-luckenbach.jpg~ alt=~Viva Luckenbach!~><p>In 1991 and 1992, Walker hosted the weekly TV show The Texas Connection on TNN. In 1993, he returned to Luckenbach for an anniversary recording that became the album Viva Luckenbach! Walker's birthday is a major celebration in Austin every March, when he plays several shows in different local clubs and theaters. In 1999, he published an autobiography, Gypsy Songman, accompanied by an LP of the same name. Walker's 2003 album Jerry Jeff Jazz showcased him singing jazz-pop and swing standards with a small, tightly knit combo. It was followed in 2004 by a live album and video, The One and Only. The studio album Moon Child appeared in 2009, and included originals along with covers of John Denver's ~Back Home Again,~ Jimmie Dale Gilmore's ~Tonight I Think I'm Gonna Go Downtown,~ and Susanna Clark's ~I’ll Be Your San Antonio Rose~ (the latter with guest vocals from Christine Albert).</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Kurt Wolff</strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>Jerry Jeff Walker was issued on Decca in 1972, and completed his rambling transition from New York folkie to Texas singer/songwriter. He'd left New York a decade earlier, but with all of his running around, he didn't make Austin home until 1971. Everywhere in this record's grooves -- which was recorded in different sessions in both cities -- is the latter's famed good-time, laid-back, take-it-as-it-comes feeling. The organic nature of the sound here is simply because Walker and two different groups (at least) of musicians played the songs live from the studio floor with no soundboard. These first versions of ~Hill Country Rain~ and ~Charlie Dunn~ are virtually peerless. Two Guy Clark tunes (~That Old Time Feeling~ and ~L.A. Freeway~) rival the songwriter's versions and ~Curly and Lil~ and ~When I Had You~ guarantee the makings of one of the original Texas Music Scene's classics; the music made now that uses that moniker -- from Pat Green's to Cross Canadian Ragweed's -- is merely revisionist history and can be dismissed as such. Walker is at the peak of his powers on this album; it was the first in a string of his records that wouldn't run out, quality-wise, until the end of the decade. He is surrounded by what would become the Lost Gonzo Band (Bob Livingston, Gary P. Nunn, Craig Hillis, and Michael McGreary), with Mary Eagan and Dave Cook adding fiddle and pedal steel, respectively, and with a lively crew of friends (including Mickey Raphael playing harmonica on ~That Old Time Feeling~). In New York, Walker went to ~mix~ his Texas record with Michael Brovsky, and landed when the Gonzos were playing The Bitter End, prompting more live sessions. In addition to the band, Michael Murphey, David Bromberg, Andy Newmark, Joanne Vent, and Ellen Kearney played on the recordings that cut that part of the album. ~Her Good Lovin' Grace~ (though not the final track) sums up the ambience of these two informal, even revelatory, sessions, as the (Texas) band slips and slides its way through a song in the process of being written as it's recorded. Amazing. Like It's a Good Night for Singin', Ridin' High, and Viva Terlingua, this is a masterpiece, full of terrific songs, fine playing, and a sound that defines the era, yet is timeless.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

It's the Live at the Fillmore East of redneck Texas folk-rock. Essentially, it's Jerry Jeff fronting the Lost Gonzo Band at the beginning of their long run together playing, living it up, having a ball, giving everybody the impression that life was a party, and to be sure, it was for a while. Given the loose, inspired performance on this set, Walker was every bit the equal of Willie, Waylon, and Billy Joe Shaver at the time. The material is terrific. Half of it is from Jerry Jeff's catalog: ~Sangria Wine,~ ~Gettin' By,~ ~Little Bird,~ ~Get It Out,~ and ~Wheel.~ The rest? Can't possibly do better: Guy Clark's ~Desperados Waiting for the Train,~ Ray Wylie Hubbard's ~Up Against the Wall, Redneck Mother,~ Michael Murphy's ~Backslider's Wine,~ and Gary P. Nunn's Austin City Limits anthem, ~London Homesick Blues.~ It doesn't sound anything like it was recorded in front of an audience, but it does sound live as hell. These folks were partyin' it up and layin' down the tracks at white heat. This record was made in a night and it feels like it was made in your living room. It's guaranteed to lift any dark mood within 15 minutes. This record asks no questions and there are no hidden meanings in Walker's or anybody else's lyrics; it's all there for the taking. And that's what makes it the enduring classic it is.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

Walker wrote six of the album's ten tracks, the Lost Gonzo Band's Gary P. Nunn wrote two more, Billy Callery wrote one, and David Cohen wrote another. It was all in the family. It's an up-tempo, rockin' country record with ~Salvation Army Band~ kicking everything off; it's followed by a drunken, barely pulled-off ~Will There Be Any~ a cappella. There are the tough outlaw love songs like ~She Left Me Holdin'~ and the long, moving ballad ~My Old Man,~ which follows the wild Dixieland ride of ~I Like to Sleep Late in the Morning.~ There's Gary Nunn fronting the band on a live version of ~Rock Me, Roll Me~ and the brass band feel of ~The First Showboat.~ This is where Stephen Foster meets Louis Armstrong's Hot Fives meets Jerry Jeff's lazy, drawling Texas bass voice on the Mississippi. The album's high point is a ballad, Walker's version ~Well of the Blues~ by Nunn. It's simply arranged: a piano, a bass drum, a brushed snare, Walker's deep voice, and a backing chorus with a B3 easing in the background very slowly and faintly. What can you say? It's another winner.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>The mid- to late '70s were good to Jerry Jeff Walker. He recorded a string of absolutely endearing classics of the outlaw singer/songwriter genre of country music: Viva Terlingua, Walker's Collectibles, Jerry Jeff Walker, It's a Good Night for Singin', the live A Man Must Carry On, and this one, Ridin' High from 1975. Most Walker fans will argue like hell about which is best, but they are interchangeably great and stand the test of time in the same way Guy Clark's and Billy Joe Shaver's albums do. In any case, Ridin' High is pure Texas country drunk & roll with some Nash Vegas players added to the Lost Gonzo Band for some truly Cosmic Cowboy yammering. The material here is top-notch: Willie Nelson's ~Pick Up the Tempo,~ Bob Livingston's ~Public Domain,~ and Guy Clark's ~Like a Coat from the Cold~ -- and they're the first three tracks on the album! Walker has a way of delivering drunken anthems and tender ballads in his deep bass voice that brings you into the song so far you feel as if he's singing it just for you and your friends. He does this consistently on this album, backed by a star cast of players including not only the Gonzos but also Johnny Gimble, David Briggs, Norbert Putnam, and others. And the gorgeous horn touches added by Michael Brovsky are stunning. Two of Walker's own best songs are here, ~I Love You,~ written for his then new wife Susan, and the rowdy man's good-time anthem ~Pissin' in the Wind.~ The album is rounded out by Jesse Winchester's ~Mississippi You're on My Mind,~ Mike Burton's oft-covered nugget ~Night Rider's Lament,~ and a few others. The album feels like a solid stream of hippie cowboy music fed by cold Lone Star, lots of pot, and the occasional line. To listen closely is to miss the point. This is an album to be experienced with the senses, entering into the free flow of Walker's good-time world even for the 40 minutes it takes to listen to the album. But that's far better than nothin', ain't it?</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

Welch was born in 1968 in California and grew up in West Los Angeles, where her parents scored the music for the comedy program <I>The Carol Burnett Show</I>. It was as a child that she became fascinated by bluegrass and early country music, in particular the work of the Stanley Brothers, the Delmore Brothers, and the Carter Family.</p><P>In the early '90s, Welch attended the Berklee School of Music in Boston, MA, where she began performing her own material, as well as traditional country and bluegrass songs, as part of a duo with fellow student David Rawlings. After honing their skills in local open mike showcases, the duo began performing regularly throughout the country. While opening for Peter Rowan in Nashville, they were spotted by musician and producer T-Bone Burnett, who helped Welch and Rawlings land a record deal. With Burnett producing, they cut 1996's starkly beautiful <I>Revival</I>, an album split between bare-bones duo performances &mdash; some even recorded in mono to capture a bygone sound &mdash; and more full-bodied cuts featuring legendary session men like guitarist James Burton, upright bassist Roy Huskey Jr., and drummers Buddy Harmon and Jim Keltner.</p><P>Her sophomore album, <I>Hell Among the Yearlings</I>, followed in 1998. The years following her second release found Welch involved in several soundtracks (<I>O Brother Where Art Thou</I>, <I>Songcatcher</I>), tribute albums (<I>Songs of Dwight Yoakam: Will Sing for Food</I>, <I>Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons</I>), and guest spots on other artists' albums (Ryan Adams' ><I>Heartbreaker</I>, Mark Knopfler's <I>Sailing to Philadelphia</I>). Following the success of <I>O Brother</I>, Welch and Rawlings found themselves in the center of a traditional American folk revival and released their third album, <I>Time (The Revelator)</I>, in mid-2001. Steady touring, guest appearances, and the release of a DVD (he Revelator Collection) kept the pair busy, but in 2003 they found time to record <I>Soul Journey</I>, their second release on their own Acony Records label.</p>",

On occasion, the performances and songs are a bit too studied to be truly effective, but those moments are fleeting -- <i>Hell Among the Yearlings</i> offers ample proof that Welch is a talented, individual songwriter and that her debut was no fluke.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Owens</b>"

				"review": "<p>Gillian Welch's third album, Time (The Revelator), finds the folk vocalist and musician shifting her attention from achingly beautiful mountain ballads to achingly beautiful pop/rock ballads. Regarding this album, Welch states: ~As opposed to being little tiny folk songs or traditional songs, they're really tiny rock songs. They're just performed in this acoustic setting. In our heads we went electric without changing instruments.~ This philosophy is most evident in songs like ~I Want to Sing That Rock and Roll~ and ~Elvis Presley Blues,~ with her longtime collaborator David Rawlings accompanying her on Louvin-esque high harmonies and vintage guitar. Fans of the duo's neo-old-timey sound will be happy to hear a few of their familiar, intimate dust bowl folk songs peering through the fence posts.</p><p>The banjo-driven ~My First Lover~ could've been recorded on Alan Lomax's back porch, while the title track aches and moans along with the best of her two previous albums. Rawlings' production on the album remains warm and intimate throughout, capturing the subtleties of the acoustic instruments and earthy harmonies. Highlights include the passionate romp ~Red Clay Halo,~ which includes the best elements of time-honored folk stylings and their newfound passion for rock & roll, and the hushed awe that captures the audience in the Ryman Auditorium during the live recording of ~I Want to Sing That Rock and Roll.~ <i>Time (The Revelator)</i> ends with an unprecedented 15-minute track called ~I Dream a Highway,~ which drifts lazily through the album's final moments, sweetly dozing in the current like Huck and Jim's Mississippi River afternoons. Welch and Rawlings are at the top of their form and continue to make the best Americana recordings without resorting to drenching their albums in guest stars, but by writing and performing heartfelt songs that speak with a clear and undeniable honesty.</p>&mdash; <b>Zac Johnson</b>"

		"biography": "<p>Tony Joe White has parlayed his songwriting talent into a modestly successful country and rock career in Europe as well as America. Born July 23, 1943, in Goodwill, LA, White was born into a part-Cherokee family. He began working clubs in Texas during the mid-'60s, and moved to Nashville by 1968. White's 1969 debut album for Monument, Black and White, featured his Top Ten pop hit ~Polk Salad Annie~ and another charting single, ~Roosevelt and Ira Lee (Night of the Moccasin).~ That same year, Dusty Springfield reached the charts with White's ~Willie and Laura Mae Jones.~ Brook Benton recorded a version of White's ~Rainy Night in Georgia~ that hit number four early in 1970; the song has since become a near-standard with more than 100 credits. White's own ~Groupie Girl~ began his European success with a short stay on the British charts in 1970.</p><p>White moved to Warner Bros. in 1971, but success eluded him on his three albums — <i>Tony Joe White</i>, <i>The Train I'm On</i>, and <i>Homemade Ice Cream</i>. Other stars, however, continued to keep his name on the charts during the 1970s: Elvis charted with ~For Ol' Times Sake~ and ~I've Got a Thing About You Baby~ (Top Five on the country charts), and Hank Williams Jr. took ~Rainy Night in Georgia~ to number 13 on the country charts. White himself recorded <i>Eyes</i> for 20th Century Fox in 1976, but then disappeared for four years. He signed to Casablanca for 1980's <i>The Real Thang</i> but moved to Columbia in 1983 for <i>Dangerous</i>, which included the modest country hits ~The Lady in My Life~ and ~We Belong Together.~</p><p>Tony Joe White was inactive through much of the '80s, but worked with Tina Turner on her 1989 <i>Foreign Affair</i> album, writing four songs and playing guitar and harmonica. He released <i>Closer to the Truth</i> a year later for his own Swamp label, and toured with Eric Clapton and Joe Cocker to very receptive French crowds (<i>Closer to the Truth</i> has sold 100,000 copies in that country alone). His 1993 album, <i>Path of a Decent Groove</i>, was released only in France, though Warner's <i>The Best of Tony Joe White</i> earned an American release the same year. <i>Lake Placid Blues</i> (1995) and <i>One Hot July</i> (1998) were Europe-only efforts until 2000, when Hip-O Records brought out <i>One Hot July</i> in the U.S., giving White his first new major label domestic release in 17 years.</p>&mdash; <b>John Bush</b>",

		"name": "The Who",
		"biography": "<p>Few rock & roll bands were riddled with as many contradictions as the Who. All four members had wildly different personalities, as their notorious live performances demonstrated: Keith Moon fell over his drum kit while Pete Townshend leaped into the air with his guitar, spinning his right hand in exaggerated windmills. Vocalist Roger Daltrey prowled the stage as bassist John Entwistle stood silent, the eye of the hurricane. They clashed frequently, but these frictions resulted in a decade's worth of remarkable music. Though it took a while to find their audience, by the late '60s the Who rivaled the Rolling Stones as a live act and in album sales.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/tw-tommy.jpg~ alt=~Tommy~><p>Key figures of the British Invasion and the mid-'60s mod movement, the Who were an undeniably powerful sonic force. They exploded conventional rock and R&B structures with Townshend's furious guitar chords, Entwistle's hyperactive basslines, and Moon's vigorous, seemingly chaotic drumming. Unlike most rock bands, the Who based their rhythm on Townshend's guitar, letting Moon and Entwistle improvise wildly over his foundation, while Daltrey belted out his vocals. The band thrived on this sound in concert, but on record they were a different proposition: Townshend pushed the group toward new sonic territory, incorporating pop art and conceptual extended musical pieces into the group's style. He was regarded as one of the era's finest British songwriters, as songs like ~The Kids Are Alright~ and ~My Generation~ became teenage anthems, while his rock opera Tommy earned respect from mainstream music critics.</p><p>However, the rest of the Who, especially Entwistle and Daltrey, weren't always eager to follow his musical explorations. They wanted to play hard rock instead of Townshend's textured song suites and vulnerable pop songs. The Who settled into their role as arena rockers in the mid-'70s, continuing on this path after Moon's death in 1978 and following it through various disbandments and reunions in the '80s and '90s. Nevertheless, at their peak, the Who were one of rock's most innovative and powerful bands.</p><p>Townshend and Entwistle met while attending high school in London's Shepherd's Bush area. In their early teens, they played in a Dixieland band, with Entwistle on trumpet and Townshend on banjo. By the early '60s, the pair had formed a rock & roll band, but in 1962 Entwistle joined the Detours, a hard-edged group featuring a sheet-metal worker named Roger Daltrey on lead guitar. By the end of the year, Townshend had joined as a rhythm guitarist, and in 1963 Daltrey became the group's lead vocalist after Colin Dawson left the band. The group's sound evolved rapidly, influenced not only by American acts such as James Brown, Booker T. & the MG's, and Eddie Cochran but also one classic British act, Johnny Kidd & the Pirates, who rocked the British charts with an original called ~Shakin' All Over~ (which Townshend and company added to their set list). They built their reputation on fierce renditions of American-style R&B, which relied on a lean single guitar/bass/drums approach with the guitarist playing lead and rhythm, a rarity in England at the time. Townshend, realizing that approach suited him, became the band's lone guitarist. A name change also followed; with the Beatles burning up the charts, they needed something more striking than the Detours. Daltrey and Townshend settled on the Who, which confused people in conversation initially, but worked memorably on posters. Amid these changes, original drummer Doug Sandom -- who was married and considerably older than the others -- parted ways with the band just as they were about to attempt cutting a record. The group replaced him with Keith Moon, previously the drummer for the surf-rock group the Beachcombers.</p><p>As the group struggled to get a break, Townshend attended art school, while the remaining three worked odd jobs. The band became regulars at the Marquee Club in London and attracted a small following, leading to the interest of manager Pete Meaden. Under his direction, the Who were renamed the High Numbers and dressed in sharp suits to appeal to style- and R&B-obsessed mods. Many R&B-oriented groups tried to cultivate relationships with the mods, who could fill clubs and help propel a record onto the charts; among those who succeeded most, besides the Who, were the Small Faces (~face~ being a part of mod slang) and the Move.</p><p>The High Numbers released one single, ~I'm the Face.~ After it bombed, the group began working with Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp, two fledgling music business entrepreneurs. Lambert was the son of composer/arranger Constant Lambert; Stamp was the brother of actor Terence Stamp, and both wanted to make their mark on England's percolating music scene. Lambert spotted the group playing at the Railway Hotel in the wake of ~I'm the Face~ and brought in Stamp. Lambert and Stamp encouraged them to embrace the mod movement, advising them on what to play and wear, including the target T-shirt that became a visual signature. The group reclaimed the Who name and began playing a set consisting entirely of soul, R&B, and Motown -- or, as their posters said, ~Maximum R&B.~</p><p>During this period, Townshend smashed his first guitar at a gig at the Railway Hotel by accident. A temporary stage extension built by the band caused him to hit the ceiling with his guitar; frustrated by the damage, and the crowd's reaction, he struck it until it was in pieces; he was only able to finish the show by using a recently acquired 12-string Rickenbacker. The following week, he discovered that people had come to see him smash his guitar. He eventually obliged with encouragement from Keith Moon, who attacked his drum kit. At first Lambert and Stamp were appalled, but Townshend soon demolished another guitar as part of Lambert's publicity campaign (and it worked, even though the journalist for whose benefit he committed the destruction never actually saw it). He didn't smash guitars at every show in those days; what he was doing in terms of generating feedback sufficed in most audience's minds. It did enhance their status with the mods: by late 1964, they'd developed an enthusiastic following: mods loved destruction as part of an act.</p><p>At the end of 1964, Townshend presented the group with an original song called ~I Can't Explain,~ which owed a little to the Kinks' ~You Really Got Me,~ but had lots of fresh angles. Townshend's lyrics gave a vivid impression of teenage angst perfect for Daltrey's powerful vocals and the band's full-bore attack. The result was equally punchy, sensitive, and macho, with a mean lead guitar and even some harmonies. The band and their managers thought it seemed like a great potential debut single for the newly rechristened Who. So did producer Shel Talmy, an American based in England who was producing the Kinks' records (including ~You Really Got Me~). Talmy got the band a contract with the American Decca Records label on the strength of ~I Can't Explain~ and followed it with a contract with English Decca (the two companies were separate entities at the time).</p><p>The Talmy-produced single arrived to little attention in January 1965. After the group's incendiary performance on the television program Ready, Steady, Go -- which featured Townshend and Moon destroying their instruments -- ~I Can't Explain~ reached the British Top Ten. Their next single, that summer's ~Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere,~ declared the mod ethos to the world: ~I can go anywhere (where I choose).~ While it wasn't far removed from the mentality behind early rock & roll anthems, the Who made it sound resolutely English. That fall, ~My Generation~ climbed to number two on the charts, confirming their status as a British pop phenomenon. An album of the same name appeared at year's end, featuring various R&B covers and some interesting originals (mostly by Townshend) on the U.K. Brunswick label.</p><p>Early in 1966, ~Substitute~ became their fourth British Top Ten hit. Produced by Kit Lambert, the single marked the band's acrimonious split with Talmy and the end of the group's British Decca/Brunswick recording contract. Lambert and Stamp also tried to scrap the American Decca deal, but that proved impossible. Starting with ~Substitute,~ the band was signed to Polydor in England, and issued on Reaction. For a time, there were rival releases on Brunswick and Reaction, but the competition was eventually sorted out in Lambert and Stamp's (and the band's) favor. ~I'm a Boy,~ released in the summer of 1966, was the first Who single without a rival release on Brunswick, and it showed just how far the band and Townshend had come in 18 months. During this period, Lambert introduced Townshend to a huge range of classical music that broadened his way of thinking about composition, songs, and subject matter: ~I'm a Boy,~ about a teenage boy forced to dress and act like a girl by his dominating mother, carried an amazing amount of exposition, but left plenty of room for the band's furious attack. In their own way, the Who were having as profound effect on rock & roll as the Beatles or the Rolling Stones: they generated immensely popular English singles that redefined the acceptable content and boundaries of pop/rock music and were also some of the era's hardest -- yet most melodic and complex -- songs.</p><p>The story in the United States was very different. ~I Can't Explain~ barely created a ripple, and ~Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere~ didn't do much better, despite publicity on the ABC television rock & roll showcase Shindig. Even with Decca getting behind ~My Generation~ for a major marketing push, it only got to number 74, a shadow of what it did in England. British success was all well and good, but it wasn't enough. The instrument-smashing routine and the attendant effects (often involving flash-powder and damage to Moon's drums, as well as Townshend's guitars) were frightfully expensive, and the band was carrying an ongoing debt that drove expenses through the roof. Financial ruin was never far from the thoughts of their management, despite the fact that Lambert and Stamp now had their own Polydor imprint, Track Records -- which had a new signing in late 1966, a transplanted American guitarist/singer named Jimi Hendrix. A breakthrough for the Who in America, or in the album market in a major way, was essential.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/tw-a-quick-one.jpg~ alt=~A Quick One~><p>For their second album, Lambert, Stamp, and the band had a more ambitious agenda. Townshend's success at writing singles inspired the Who's managers, and it was decided that this time, every member of the band would contribute songs to generate more revenue. Although this meant A Quick One was uneven, Lambert's presence allowed Townshend to write the title track as a ten-minute mini-opera. ~A Quick One While He's Away~ found Townshend writing (and the Who singing and playing) in idioms far beyond rock & roll, including faux Western and faux operetta. Getting dedicated rockers Daltrey and Entwistle to throw their full talents into the music, and the track's successful extended narrative, showed Townshend and company that this idea had potential. A Quick One also provided a canvas for Entwistle's blossoming songwriting: His macabre humor shone through on the catchy ~Boris the Spider~ and ~Whisky Man,~ the latter showing off his skills on the French horn. Moon's ~Cobwebs and Strange~ was also a suitable moment of light humor, and even Daltrey -- whose songwriting aspirations never rated much of his attention -- contributed ~See My Way.~ A Quick One had a diversity of sounds and creative voices, though the Who got relatively little recognition for it at the time.</p><p>Upon its 1966 release, A Quick One became another British hit, and also provided a minor American breakthrough. Retitled Happy Jack, its title track reached the Top 40 in early 1967. To do that, the Who played the U.S. as part of a package tour organized by DJ-turned-impresario Murray the K. Booked alongside Cream, folkies Jim & Jean, and Wilson Pickett, doing short sets five times a day, the group got the necessary exposure to a wider public, even though ~Happy Jack~'s vocal harmonies and relatively restrained guitars made it an atypical Who song. Their next major U.S. milestone was playing the Fillmore in San Francisco. For that occasion, they had a problem that was the reverse of the Murray the K performances: the latter had been too slight at 15 to 20 minutes, but their usual 40-minute sets were too short for the Fillmore. In the Richard Barnes book Maximum R&B, it was recalled that to lengthen their set, they learned the entire mini-opera and the rest of A Quick One, which they hadn't performed live. After the Fillmore gig in June 1967, they played their most important American show yet, the Monterey International Pop Festival, which put them in a duel with labelmate Jimi Hendrix to see who could end their set more outrageously. Hendrix won with his incendiary performance, but the Who acquitted themselves admirably with a dramatic destruction of their instruments. Reverting to their old stage antics was especially awkward, as they'd finished an album and single that represented a new phase.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/tw-sell-out.jpg~ alt=~The Who Sell Out~><p>Constructed as a mock-pirate radio broadcast, The Who Sell Out was a concept album and a loving tribute to England's pirate radio stations, which had been closed in a government crackdown. The group threw everything they had into the album in order to solidify their position in England and finally crack the U.S. market, including the classic ~I Can See for Miles.~ An explosion of excitement and controlled tension, it seemed like a certain chart-topper. Daltrey's performance was the best of his career to date, matched by Townshend's slashing guitar, Moon's frenetic drumming, and Entwistle's anchor-like bass. It took a lot of work at three different studios -- including Los Angeles' Gold Star -- on two continents and two coasts to get that sound; as a consequence, it was so difficult to perform that it became the only hit that they abandoned playing live. It became their first Top Ten hit in America, and reached number two in England, but that wasn't sufficient for what the band or their management needed.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/tw-direct-hits.jpg~ alt=~Direct Hits~><p>The group spent much of 1968 seeing the singles ~Call Me Lightning,~ ~Magic Bus,~ and ~Dogs~ -- inspired by Townshend's interest in dog racing -- fail to meet expectations. Track Records, squeezed for cash even with Hendrix's burgeoning sales, assembled Direct Hits, which compiled the band's recent singles (minus the Shel Talmy-produced Brunswick sides). In the United States, Decca Records -- with only two actual ~hits~ by the group to work with, plus ~Magic Bus~ (which did unexpectedly well on that side of the Atlantic) -- released Magic Bus, an unacknowledged compilation album built around the hit and drawn from U.K. singles, EPs, and recent album tracks. It was misleadingly subtitled ~The Who on Tour,~ and that's a lot of what they did in 1968, especially in the United States, but not the way they did in 1967; this time, they were playing places like the Fillmore East, where they recorded one show for a possible live album. This plan went awry when the show wasn't quite good enough to represent the group, and was abandoned entirely with the vast changes in their songbook in 1969. While making their first serious long-term headway in the U.S., the band -- mostly Townshend, in collaboration with Lambert on the early libretto -- were devising and recording a large-scale work.</p><p>Tommy arrived in May of 1969, more than a year-and-a-half after The Who Sell Out. However, it was still unfinished; the band wanted to add more instruments on certain songs, and Entwistle was particularly upset at the bass sound on the released recording. But they were out of money and options, so Tommy was released as a work in progress. And for the first time, the stars lined up in the Who's favor, especially in the United States. The serious rock press seized on the album as a masterpiece, while the mainstream press started to take rock music seriously. The Who were new and fresh enough, and Tommy ambitious enough, that it became one of the most widely reviewed and written-about albums in history. Tommy climbed into the American Top Ten as the group supported the album with an extensive tour where they played the complete opera. In some respects, Tommy became too successful. Audiences expected it to be done in its entirety at every show, and suddenly the Who were routinely playing for two hours at a clip. The work soon overshadowed the Who; it was performed as a play, redone as an orchestrated all-star extravaganza (starring Daltrey and featuring Townshend's guitar), and would eventually be filmed by Ken Russell in 1975 (the movie starred Daltrey). In 1993, Townshend turned it into a Broadway musical with director Des McAnuff.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/tw-live-at-leeds.jpg~ alt=~Live at Leeds~><p>While Tommy kept the band busy touring for almost two years, how to follow it stumped Townshend. As he worked on new material, the group released Live at Leeds in 1970 (which yielded the hit single ~Summertime Blues~), as well as the single ~The Seeker,~ giving them some breathing room. Eventually, he settled on Lifehouse, a sci-fi rock opera strongly influenced by the teachings of his guru, Meher Baba, that pushed the group into new sonic territory with electronics and synthesizers. The rest of the Who weren't particularly enthralled with Lifehouse, claiming not to understand its plot, and their reluctance contributed to Townshend suffering a nervous breakdown. Once he recovered, the group picked up the pieces of the abandoned project and recorded Who's Next with producer Glyn Johns. Boasting a harder sound, Who's Next was a major hit, and many of its tracks -- including ~Baba O'Riley,~ ~Bargain,~ ~Behind Blue Eyes,~ and ~Won't Get Fooled Again~ (which were both issued as singles), and Entwistle's ~My Wife~ -- became cornerstones of '70s album-oriented FM radio. The Who's Next tour solidified the band as one of the two top live rock attractions in the world along with the Rolling Stones. Suddenly their history was of interest to millions of fans; Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy, a 14-song retrospective of their singles, also sold in massive numbers.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/tw-quadrophenia.jpg~ alt=~Quadrophenia~><p>The success of Who's Next spurred Townshend to attempt another opera. With Quadrophenia, he abandoned fantasy to sketch a portrait of a '60s mod. He stopped working with Kit Lambert, who lost influence with the group in Tommy's wake; the band also left Lambert and Stamp's management. As Townshend wrote the album in 1972, he released Who Came First, a collection of private recordings and demos he made for Meher Baba. Entwistle began his own solo career with Smash Your Head Against the Wall, which he followed with Whistle Rhymes, released the same day as Townshend's album. A double album, Quadrophenia sold extremely well, but it proved to be a troublesome concert piece. It was difficult to play live, and few outside of England were familiar with its mod subject matter. It soon became clear that audiences hadn't had the time to familiarize themselves with the work, leading to a lukewarm response on tour. After some retooling, the group performed an abbreviated version of Quadrophenia with some success.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/tw-two-sides.jpg~ alt=~Two Sides of the Moon~><p>The Who began to fragment after Quadrophenia's release. In public, Townshend fretted over his role as a rock spokesman; in private, he sank into alcohol abuse. Entwistle concentrated on his solo career, including recordings with his side projects Ox and Rigor Mortis. Meanwhile, Daltrey approached the peak of his powers: he had become a truly great singer and was surprisingly comfortable as an actor as he alternately pursued a film career and solo albums. Moon continued to party, celebrating his substance abuse and releasing the solo album Two Sides of the Moon. During this hiatus, the group issued the rarities collection Odds & Sods (1974), which surpassed existing bootleg collections and charted like a new release. Meanwhile, Townshend worked on new songs, resulting in 1975's disarmingly personal The Who by Numbers. The album was a hit, though its number eight placement in the U.S. reflected listeners' modestly diminishing enthusiasm (Quadrophenia, despite being a rather expensive double LP built around a somewhat outré subject, reached number two on both sides of the Atlantic). Following The Who by Numbers tour, the band took an extended hiatus.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/tw-who-are-you.jpg~ alt=~Who Are You~><p>During the late '70s, they started to succumb to age and the rock & roll lifestyle. After years of playing live, Townshend permanently damaged his hearing. On their 1976 tour, Moon collapsed on-stage just a few minutes into a show at the Boston Garden. He recovered and seemed to laugh off the incident, while an audience member sat in behind the drum kit to allow the band to finish playing. He continued partying and even suggested a possible successor, ex-Small Faces/Faces drummer Kenney Jones. The Who reconvened in early 1978 to record Who Are You, which was released that August, accompanied by a stunning promotional/performance video of the title song. Instead of responding to the insurgent punk movement, which labeled the Who as has-beens, the album represented the group's heaviest flirtation with prog rock since Quadrophenia. It was a huge hit, peaking at number two in the American charts and selling platinum. Instead of being a triumphant comeback, however, Who Are You became a symbol of tragedy: on September 7, 1978, Moon died of a drug overdose. Since he was such an integral part of the Who's sound and image, the band debated carrying on. Though they continued, all three surviving members later claimed they felt the Who ended with Moon's death.</p><p>They took Moon's suggestion and hired Small Faces drummer Kenney Jones as his replacement, as well as keyboardist John ~Rabbit~ Bundrick, and began working on new material in 1979. Before they released a new record, they released the live documentary The Kids Are Alright and contributed music to Franc Roddam's cinematic adaptation of Quadrophenia, which starred Phil Daniels. The Who began touring later that year, but the tour's momentum was destroyed when 11 attendees at the group's December 3, 1979, concert at Cincinnati's Riverfront Coliseum were trampled to death in a rush for choice festival seating. The band wasn't informed of the incident until after the concert, and the tragedy deflated whatever good will they had.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/tw-face-dances.jpg~ alt=~Face Dances~><p>Following the Cincinnati concert, the Who slowly fell apart. Townshend became addicted to cocaine, heroin, tranquilizers, and alcohol, suffering a near-fatal overdose in 1981. Meanwhile, Entwistle and Daltrey soldiered on in their solo careers. The band reconvened in 1981 to record their first album since Moon's death, Face Dances, a hit that received mixed reviews. The following year, they released It's Hard and embarked on a supporting tour billed as their farewell to fans, with the live Who's Last arriving in 1984 as a commemoration of the tour.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/tw-join-together.jpg~ alt=~Join Together~><p>The farewell tour wasn't the Who's final goodbye. While Entwistle and Daltrey's solo careers lost momentum in the '80s, Townshend continued recording to relative success. However, the Who still haunted him. The group reunited to play Live Aid in 1985, and three years later, they played a British music awards program. In 1989, Townshend agreed to reunite (minus Jones, who was replaced by session drummer Simon Phillips) for a 25th anniversary American tour, which was perceived as a way to make a lot of money -- which Daltrey and especially Entwistle needed. They followed it with a live album, Join Together.</p><p>The Who reconvened in 1994 for two concerts celebrating Daltrey's 50th birthday, commercial success that helped Townshend's effort to bring Tommy to the Broadway stage. It became a huge hit and revived interest in the album. Townshend revived Quadrophenia in 1996, reuniting the Who to perform it at the Prince's Trust concert in Hyde Park that summer, and it was followed that fall by an American tour that proved to be a failure. The following summer, the Who launched an oldies tour of America that was ignored by the press. In October 2001, they played the Concert for New York City benefit for families of the victims of the September 11 attacks.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/tw-wire-and-glass.jpg~ alt=~The Who: Wire & Glass - Six Songs from a Mini-Opera~><p>In late June 2002, the Who were about to kick off a North American tour when Entwistle died at the age of 57 in Las Vegas' Hard Rock Hotel. In 2006, Townshend and Daltrey released the mini-opera Wire & Glass, their first collaboration as the Who in over 20 years. The full-length Endless Wire, which included the EP, was released later that year to the best reviews of any Who album since Who Are You 28 years earlier; the accompanying tour was similarly well-received. On December 7, 2008, at a gala ceremony in Washington, D.C., Townshend and Daltrey received Kennedy Center Honors for the Who's lifetime contributions to American culture.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/tw-quadrophenia-live.jpg~ alt=~Quadrophenia: Live in London~><p>Townshend rumbled about the Who writing and recording new material, but instead, he and Daltrey turned their attention to Quadrophenia, once again touring the album in its entirety. After a full performance in 2010 to benefit the Teenage Cancer Trust, a Quadrophenia and More tour began in the summer of 2012 and ran for over a year, culminating with a July concert at Wembley Arena that was later released as the live package Quadrophenia: Live in London. This 2014 release was the opening salvo in a farewell tour, with dates in 2015 in cities they hadn't played previously. A hits compilation appeared late in 2014; titled The Who Hits 50!, it included the band's first new material in almost a decade with the song ~Be Lucky.~ The Who supported The Who Hits 50! with a tour that ran into 2016. Townshend and Daltrey then turned their attention to completing their first album since Endless Wire. Entitled Who, the album appeared in December 2019. </p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>",

				"review": "<p>As many Who fans know, disputes between the Who and producer Shel Talmy held back the release of a CD version of <em>My Generation</em> taken from the best available original sources for quite some time. Eventually the dispute was resolved, and 2002 saw the release of the deluxe edition of this classic album, expanded into a two-CD work with the addition of no less than 17 extra tracks. So is it time to celebrate and finally throw away that scratchy old <em>My Generation</em> LP, whichever version of that you have? Unfortunately, not quite. Pluses first: The sound, remixed in stereo by Talmy, is very good indeed, very clear and punchy without sacrificing the enormous power the band brought to the sessions, sometimes revealing parts with a clarity never before heard. This also, finally, adds some seminal non-LP tracks also recorded in 1965 (most notably their debut single, ~I Can't Explain~), as well as a bunch of R&amp;B cover outtakes that previously surfaced on the 1980s comps <em>Who's Missing</em> and <em>Two's Missing</em>.</p><p>There are also slightly longer versions of a few tracks; an instrumental track for ~My Generation~ and an ~a cappella version~ of ~Anytime You Want Me~; and one genuine previously unheard song, ~Instant Party Mixture,~ a weird and not good takeoff on Dion's ~Runaround Sue~ that was recorded in early 1966 as a possible B-side. So what's to carp about? Well, some overdubs used in the original version of the LP have been lost, and their loss is not just something that audiophiles or unhealthily completist record collectors will notice. Specifically, on ~My Generation,~ Pete Townshend's guitar is virtually missing from the instrumental break, and the group's backup vocals at the song's climax are likewise mostly missing. Other little omissions crop up too, and though this compilation makes up for that a bit with ~monaural versions with guitar overdubs~ of ~My Generation~ and ~A Legal Matter,~ it's no small loss. Also, unbelievably, although ~Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere~ is here (and misspelled on the cover), it's an alternate version with different vocals from a French EP. It's fine to include that, but the classic single version itself, a tremendously exciting and important record, isn't present at all, and no one could reasonably claim there shouldn't have been room for both. Too, the version of ~Leaving Here~ is an alternate, and while that's fine to have as a marginally interesting addition, the version that first showed up on <em>Who's Missing</em> is, um, missing.</p><p>These shortcomings are not unimportant. If a group and label are going to bill something as the ultimate package of classic album-plus-bonus tracks, it should have everything you want to hear. This deluxe edition doesn't. This doesn't, of course, mean that it doesn't contain much great music, particularly the <em>My Generation</em> album itself, a <em>tour de force</em> of British mod music maturing from R&amp;B rave-ups into melodic power pop with riveting instrumental and lyrical hooks. It is also good to hear the nice early R&amp;B cover B-sides ~Daddy Rolling Stone~ and ~Anytime You Want Me,~ and while the R&amp;B-oriented outtakes of Motown songs like ~(Love Is  Like A) Heat Wave~ aren't so good, as historical documentation they're important. The sessions are also documented nicely in a booklet of liner notes. But no doubt we'll have to wait for the SACD or DVD or some such configuration to correct some of these flaws and separate us from more of our hard-earned cash.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p><hr/><p>The Who got bigger, brainier, better and generally tougher as they grew. But they were never as fiercely raw as they were on their first album, My Generation. In 36 minutes, they tore through the conventions of British rock 'n' roll until they found a place they could call their own. Five decades after its release, the album stands as one of rock music's greatest debuts.</p><p>For its 50th anniversary, My Generation has been expanded to a five-CD Super Deluxe Edition that adds new mixes, B-sides, singles, alternate takes and demos. And over the course of more than 75 tracks, the set sketches out a template the Who would build from and break down several times during their career, pulling in everything from R&B rave-ups and chiming pop to scorching rock 'n' roll and proto-punk anarchy.</p><p>While much of this material has surfaced on other collections, including previous anniversary editions of My Generation, the set attempts to wrangle most of the period's songs into one place. A few strays from earlier editions, mostly different alternate versions, are missing, but the Super Deluxe Edition is the most representative collection of a pivotal year in the life of the Who, starting with the ~I Can't Explain~ single from early 1965.</p><p>The center of it all is the My Generation LP, included here in a newly remastered mono mix and a stereo mix of the album from 2014 that was previously available only on iTunes. Both versions heighten the guitars and pulsing rhythm section that drive songs like ~The Kids Are Alright,~ ~A Legal Matter~ and the classic title tune. The bonus tracks here -- shuffled between mono and stereo mixes, and including some of the singles and B-sides released before and after the album came out -- serve as jagged bookends to the LP's dozen tracks.</p><p>It's a vivid portrait of the Who's first several months as professional recording artists. All these years later, the explosive clash of garage-rock R&B and serrated pop from this period that later helped form their identity sounds like a launching point of things to come -- from Roger Daltrey's throaty vocals to Pete Townshend's whipping guitar attacks to that thing Keith Moon did on the drums where he was never quite on the beat but powered the rhythm all the same.</p><p>The weakest disc here, the one dedicated to almost a dozen Townshend demos from the era, provide the sketches (and, in one case, just a fragment) for the full-band takes. They're interesting as starting points, but they don't approach the force of the released versions. (Three of the songs are brand new to Who fans; Townshend discovered the stashed-away demo tapes in 2015.)</p><p>And that's why My Generation matters the most. As the band grew and got more popular, Townshend took control as its chief songwriter and architect. This Super Deluxe Edition of the Who's debut is all about the band -- before the rock operas, fringe jackets and trashed hotels -- in all of its raging glory.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Michael Gallucci</strong></p>"

With the expansion to a two-CD format, much of the previously edited material has been reinstated to reflect the actual pacing of the show more accurately. This new mix — supervised by Pete Townshend (guitar/vocal) — is an all-encompassing stereoscape which has never felt more intimidating. Although no mention is made in the information- and memorabilia-laden 28-page liner-notes booklet, vocalist Roger Daltrey performed several vocal overdubs during <I>Tommy</I> which are unique to this release.

				"review": "<P>The Who's catalog was revamped in the mid-'90s, with every title (except My Generation, due to legal entanglements with producer Shel Talmy) receiving new remastering and bonus tracks. Nearly eight years later, Who's Next, one of the group's most beloved albums, was given another remastered/expanded treatment as part of Universal Chronicles' Deluxe Edition series. Now it spans two discs, including a full disc devoted to their legendary show at the Young Vic on April 26, 1971. Reportedly, this is also the first time the original master tapes were used for a CD master as well, and while the difference isn't as dramatically different as it was from the 1984 CD to the 1995 CD, this is a richer, resonant mix, which may be reason enough for some fans to acquire it. Most collectors will focus on the bonus material, all of which ranges from very good to great, yet the set on the whole gets a qualified recommendation for one very simple reason: The greatest of the material here was already featured as bonus material on the 1995 reissue. True, some of the versions were present as single edits, but the greatest songs — ~Pure and Easy,~ a rollicking cover of ~Baby Don't You Do It,~ the live set pieces ~Naked Eye~ and ~Water,~ ~Too Much of Anything,~ ~I Don't Even Know Myself,~ the original take of ~Behind Blue Eyes~ — were all bonus tracks on the previous edition (this is not counting the fact that the electric version of ~Love Ain't for Keepin',~ which is really good, is also on Odds &amp; Sods). That said, there is some unreleased music here that is either fascinating (the first take of ~Won't Get Fooled Again,~ which sounds as if it's on the verge of collapse) or excellent (the whole of the Young Vic show, where you can hear the band get its strength back; it's a truly fine concert). But no matter how good, or even revelatory, some of this is, the end result feels underwhelming because any Who fan has heard the most crucial music here before (and those who enjoy nitpicking will surely wonder why there wasn't more of an effort to present Lifehouse rejects and outtakes here instead of a full concert). If you're a fan, Who's Next: The Deluxe Edition is like paying a bill — buying it is something that needs to be done, you're glad once it's done, but it's not something you're necessarily eager to do. — <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B> <P>&nbsp;</P><P>Few albums in the pantheon of classic rock recordings embody the greatness of an artist more than 1971's Who's Next. Arguably the Who's finest effort, the album came at a time when the group was at its creative peak. Fresh off the monumental success of the rock opera Tommy in 1969, the band had ridden a wave of critical acclaim for the album and subsequent live performances of its material, highlighted by memorable gigs at the Metropolitan Opera House, Woodstock, and the Isle of Wight. The scope of Tommy had drawn attention to Pete Townshend's emerging genius as a songwriter, and in the process set a standard that he would be measured by throughout the Who's illustrious career. The viability of Tommy as a recorded and live vehicle had given Townshend renewed confidence in his own abilities, and had motivated him to take on larger challenges. His primary focus post Tommy came in the form of the Lifehouse project, a grandiose look at the possibilities of music in a futuristic setting. Townshend's idealized views on rock and roll as an element of one's being, laid the groundwork for an elaborately sophisticated creation consisting of a feature film, expansive album, and interactive live concerts. While plausible to Townshend, the intricate blueprint for musical salvation proved to be a logistical impossibility, and the project gradually unraveled into disarray. In spite of its failure to reach fruition, the Lifehouse project yielded enough quality recorded material to assemble the nine-song album Who's Next. At the time, no one could have foreseen the magnitude of this release, particularly Townshend himself who had viewed it as a commercial compromise of his Lifehouse vision.</P><P>Despite Townshend's initial misgivings, the magnitude of Who's Next is undeniable. The scope of its grandeur is evidenced by every track having become an FM radio staple, with much of the album's material incorporated into the Who's long standing concert set list. While each song is memorable in its own right, most notable are ~Won't Get Fooled Again~, which has reached rock anthem status, and the John Entwistle penned ~My Wife~ that proudly displays the bassist's skills as a songwriter. Simply put, it is as close to perfect an album as could be imagined. How then could a recording of this stature be improved upon? Read on. </P><P>MCA has given Who aficionados an early Christmas present with the release of Who's Next Deluxe Edition. The original album has been coupled with added songs, and a complete second disc has been included featuring a live Lifehouse performance at London's Young Vic Theater. Altogether, the twin CD set provides twenty-nine tracks totaling two and a half hours of vintage Who material. Additionally, an updated Townshend essay describing the Lifehouse project is featured, as well as extensive liner notes that shed light on the history of the album's recording processes.</P><P>Disc 1 is comprised of 15 tracks; Who's Next in its entirety, and six newly remastered recordings from early studio sessions that did not make the final album cut. Alternate versions of ~Getting in Tune~, ~Love Ain't for Keeping~, and ~Behind Blue Eyes~ give listeners slightly different looks at the material, while the original recorded version of ~Pure and Easy~ showcases the song's melodic beauty. The inclusion of an extended Motown cover of ~Baby Don't You Do It~ harkens back to the group's early club days and provides an interesting counterbalance to the album's more readily recognized tracks. The most fascinating of the additional material comes by way of a previously unreleased alternate version of ~Won't Get Fooled Again~. This take utilizes a different synthesizer track than the traditional version and is missing Daltrey's trademark scream. Overall, the six additional listings supply a welcome compliment to the album's original nine songs.</P><P>Disc 2 offers remixed versions of fourteen songs performed at the Young Vic during the Spring of 1971. Taking place at roughly the same time as gigs at Leeds and the Isle of Wight, this Lifehouse concert maintains the distinctive live sound from the period, and includes much of the same material from those shows. It also provides evidence of the Who's ability to flawlessly transition brilliant studio material to the stage. Featured tracks from Who's Next include ~Love Ain't for Keeping~, ~Behind Blue Eyes~, ~Getting in Tune~, ~Bargain~, and ~Won't Get Fooled Again~. Fiery covers of ~Young Man Blues~ and ~Road Runner~ are included in the set, as are somewhat lesser played, but no less potent renditions of ~Pure and Easy~, ~I Don't Even Know Myself~, ~Too Much of Anything~, and ~Time Is Passing~. Also in the set is an outstanding trio of concert mainstays ~Water~, ~My Generation~, and ~Naked Eye~. Throughout the performance, Daltrey's vocals are strong and gritty, Moon's drumming is sharp, Entwistle lays down his usual virtuoso thunder, and Townshend's guitar playing is flawless.</P><P>The Deluxe Edition of Who's Next is noteworthy for two reasons. First, in an age of rampant re-releases and often sub par offerings, MCA has deviated from the curve and put together an exemplary package of material for Who fans. The sound quality on both CD's is excellent, while the booklet included is informative and enlightening. Second, the creative dynamic that went into the aborted Lifehouse project can be more fully appreciated as a greater amount of original material is made available. Townshend's musical vision may have been ahead of its time, but three decades later his songs still resonate with power and passion. For the most part, Who's Next rose like a Phoenix from the ashes of Lifehouse, catching lightning in a bottle as the group was at its pinnacle of greatness. Now, the album returns to much of its original conceptualized splendor, making it even better.</P>"

				"review": "<p>The Who have issued more greatest-hits collections than any other major artist, releasing a vast array of compilations while they were together and in the years following their breakup. Released in 1996, My Generation: The Very Best of the Who was intended to be the definitive single-disc collection, replacing all the others that preceded it. While it is a very good collection, it just misses being a definitive sampler. Essentially, My Generation is a replica of Who's Better, Who's Best that adds four tracks that were missing from the previous compilation, including the seminal post-Tommy single ~The Seeker~ and the original single mix of ~Magic Bus.~ My Generation isn't strictly a singles collection, since it contains such album rock staples as ~Baba O'Riley~ and the full-length version of ~Won't Get Fooled Again.~ It also spans the group's entire career, so it has a bit of a scattershot feel to it -- ~You Better You Bet~ sounds a little odd next to tense early singles like ~Substitute~ and ~I Can See for Miles.~ The career-spanning approach doesn't make for as cohesive a collection as Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy, but it does mean that My Generation is an excellent -- even necessary -- introduction. There's a lot more in the Who's catalog that needs to be heard, but My Generation does boil down the most essential items (even though the abominable ~Squeeze Box~ is included) to a fine single-disc set.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Snappily titled The Who Hits 50!, by virtue of spanning two full CDs the set does cast a wider net than either Greatest Hits or 2004's Then & Now, beginning with the stiff R&B of the High Numbers' ~Zoot Suit~ and concluding with the brand-new ~Be Lucky,~ a delirious revival of Pete Townshend's purple, overwritten '80s midlife crisis. In between those two songs come 40 tracks, including some genuine surprises -- the bonkers mod anthem ~Dogs~ and its Beach Boys-aping flip ~Call Me Lightning,~ the band's cover of the Stones' ~The Last Time,~ the first appearance of ~Relay~ in a comp in ages, John Entwistle's paranoid ~Trick of the Light~ -- but for the most part, this serves up the same songs that have popped up again and again on Who compilations over the years. This may be predictable but as a collection of basics, either for fair-weather fans or newcomers, it does its job well and it has nice artwork to boot.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"artistid": 536,
		"firstname": "Lucinda",
		"lastname": "Williams",
		"name": "Lucinda Williams",
		"biography": "<P>The object of cultish adoration for years, singer/songwriter Lucinda Williams was universally hailed as a major talent by both critics and fellow musicians, but it took quite some time for her to parlay that respect into a measure of attention from the general public. Part of the reason was her legendary perfectionism: Williams released records only infrequently, often taking years to hone both the material and the recordings thereof. Plus, her early catalog was issued on smaller labels that agreed to her insistence on creative control but didn't have the resources or staying power to fully promote her music. Yet her meticulous attention to detail and staunch adherence to her own vision were exactly what helped build her reputation. When Williams was at her best (and she often was), even her simplest songs were rich in literary detail, from her poetic imagery to her flawed, conflicted characters. Her singing voice, whose limitations she readily acknowledged, nonetheless developed into an evocative instrument that seemed entirely appropriate to her material. So if some critics described Williams as ~the female Bob Dylan,~ they may have been oversimplifying things (Townes Van Zandt might be more apt), but the parallels were certainly too strong to ignore.</P><P>Williams was born in Lake Charles, LA, on January 26, 1953. Her father was Miller Williams, a literature professor and published poet who passed on not only his love of language, but also of Delta blues and Hank Williams. The family moved frequently, as Miller took teaching posts at colleges around Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Arkansas, and even Mexico City and Santiago, Chile. Meanwhile, Lucinda discovered folk music (especially Joan Baez) through her mother and was galvanized into trying her own hand at singing and writing songs after hearing Dylan's <I>Highway 61 Revisited</I>. Immersed in a college environment, she was also exposed to '60s rock and more challenging singer/songwriters like Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell. She started performing folk songs publicly in New Orleans and during the family's sojourn in Mexico City. In 1969, she was ejected from high school for refusing to say the Pledge of Allegiance, and she spent a year working her way through a reading list supplied by her father before leaving home.</P><P>Williams performed around New Orleans as a folk artist who mixed covers with traditional-styled originals. In 1974, she relocated to Austin, TX, and became part of that city's burgeoning roots-music scene; she later split time between Austin and Houston, and then moved to New York. A demo tape got her the chance to record for the Smithsonian's Folkways label, and she went to Jackson, MS, to lay down her first album at the Malaco studios. <I>Ramblin' on My Mind</I> (later retitled simply Ramblin') was released in 1979 and featured a selection of traditional blues, country, folk, and Cajun songs. Williams returned to Houston to record the follow-up, 1980's <I>Happy Woman Blues</I>. As her first album of original compositions, it was an important step forward, and although it was much more bound by the dictates of tradition than her genre-hopping later work, her talent was already in evidence.</P><P>However, it would be some time before that talent was fully realized. Williams flitted between Austin and Houston during the early '80s, then moved to Los Angeles in 1984, where she started to attract some major-label interest. CBS signed her to a development deal in the mid-'80s but wound up passing since neither its rock nor its country divisions knew how to market her; around the same time, a short-lived marriage to drummer Greg Sowders dissolved. Williams eventually caught on with an unlikely partner -- the British indie label Rough Trade, which was historically better known for its punk output. The simply titled <I>Lucinda Williams&gt;</I> was released in 1988, and although it didn't make any waves in the mainstream, it received glowing reviews from those who did hear it. With help from guitarist/co-producer Gurf Morlix, Williams' sound had evolved into a seamless blend of country, blues, folk, and rock; while it made perfect sense to roots-music enthusiasts, it didn't fit into the rigid tastes of radio programmers. But it was clear that she had found her songwriting voice -- the album brimmed with confidence, and so did its assertive female characters, who seemed to answer only to their own passions.</P><P>Many critics hailed Lucinda Williams as a major statement by a major new talent. Rough Trade issued a couple of EPs that featured live performances and material from <I>Lucinda Williams</I>, and Patty Loveless covered ~The Night's Too Long~ for a Top 20 country hit. However, it would be four years before Williams completed her official follow-up. She signed with RCA for a time but left when she felt that the label was pressuring her to release material she didn't deem ready for public consumption. Instead, she went to the small Elektra-distributed label Chameleon, which finally released <I>Sweet Old World</I> in 1992. A folkier outing than <I>Lucinda Williams</I>, <I>Sweet Old World</I> was an unflinching meditation on death, loss, and regret. Even its upbeat moments were colored by songs like the title track and ~Pineola,~ two stunning, heartbreaking accounts of a family friend's suicide (poet Frank Stanford, not, as many listeners assumed, Williams' own brother). Needless to say, the record won rave reviews once again, and Williams toured Australia with Rosanne Cash and Mary Chapin Carpenter.</P><P>On that tour, Carpenter decided to record ~Passionate Kisses,~ the key track and statement of purpose from Lucinda Williams. It shot into the country Top Five in 1993 and won its writer a Grammy for Country Song of the Year. Other artists soon started mining Williams' back catalog for material: avowed fan Emmylou Harris recorded ~Crescent City~ on 1993's Cowgirl's Prayer and cut ~Sweet Old World~ for her 1995 alternative country landmark Wrecking Ball; plus, Tom Petty covered ~Changed the Locks~ for 1996's movie-related She's the One. As the buzz around Williams grew, so did anticipation for her next album. With Chameleon having gone under, she signed with Rick Rubin's American Recordings label and began sessions with Morlix again co-producing. Dissatisfied with the results, Williams' rigorous retouchings led to Morlix's departure from the project and her backing band. In 1995, she moved into Harris' neighborhood in Nashville and through Harris hired Steve Earle and his production partner Ray Kennedy. At first, she was so enamored with their work that she re-recorded the entire album from scratch. When it was finished, she decided that the results sounded too produced, and took the record to Los Angeles, where she enlisted Roy Bittan (onetime E Street Band keyboardist) to co-produce a series of overdub sessions that bordered on obsessive. During the long wait for the album, the media began to pay more attention to Williams; some of the coverage was fairly unflattering, painting her as a neurotic control freak, but she always countered that it was unfair to criticize the process if the results were worthwhile.</P><P>Rubin mixed the final tracks, but the album was further delayed when he entered into negotiations to sell the American label. Mercury stepped in to purchase the rights to the album, which was finally released in 1998 under the title <I>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</I>. Boasting a bright, contemporary roots rock sound with strong country and blues flavors, not to mention major-label promotional power, the album won universal acclaim, making many critics' year-end Top Ten lists and winning The Village Voice's prestigious Pazz &amp; Jop survey. It also won Williams a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album (despite being the least folk-oriented record in her catalog) and became her first to go gold, proving to doubters that she was not just a songwriter, but a full-fledged recording artist in her own right. After a merger shakeup at Mercury, Williams wound up on the Universal-distributed roots imprint Lost Highway. She was the subject of an extensive, widely acclaimed profile in The New Yorker in 2000, written by Bill Buford, who was nominated for a National Magazine Award for his work; however, Williams and some of her supporters took issue with some of his more objective-minded analysis.</P><P>Williams delivered her next album, <I>Essence</I>, in 2001, after a relatively scant wait of just three years. An introspective collection, it often found Williams taking a simpler, more minimalistic lyrical approach and was greeted with rapturous reviews in most quarters. The track ~Get Right With God~ won Williams her third Grammy, this time for Best Female Rock Vocal, which further consolidated her credibility as a singer, not just a songwriter. Paring down the time between album releases even further, Williams returned in 2003 with <I>World Without Tears</I>, which became her highest-charting effort to date when it debuted in the Top 20. 2005 saw the release of two live recordings, one (<I>Live @ The Fillmore</I>) for Lost Highway and the other (<I>Live from Austin, TX</I>) for New West. West arrived in 2007.</P>— <B>Steve Huey</B> ",

				"review": "<p>It isn't surprising that Lucinda Williams' level of craft takes time to assemble, but the six-year wait between Sweet Old World and its 1998 follow-up, <b>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</b>, still raised eyebrows. The delay stemmed both from label difficulties and Williams' meticulous perfectionism, the latter reportedly over a too-produced sound and her own vocals. Listening to the record, one can understand why both might have concerned Williams. Car Wheels is far and away her most produced album to date, which is something of a mixed blessing. Its surfaces are clean and contemporary, with something in the timbres of the instruments (especially the drums) sounding extremely typical of a late-'90s major-label roots-rock album. While that might subtly alter the timeless qualities of Williams' writing, there's also no denying that her sound is punchier and livelier. The production also throws Williams' idiosyncratic voice into sharp relief, to the point where it's noticeably separate from the band. As a result, every inflection and slight tonal alteration is captured, and it would hardly be surprising if Williams did obsess over those small details. But whether or not you miss the earthiness of Car Wheels' predecessors, it's ultimately the material that matters, and Williams' songwriting is as captivating as ever. Intentionally or not, the album's common thread seems to be its strongly grounded sense of place -- specifically, the Deep South, conveyed through images and numerous references to specific towns. Many songs are set, in some way, in the middle or aftermath of not-quite-resolved love affairs, as Williams meditates on the complexities of human passion. Even her simplest songs have more going on under the surface than their poetic structures might indicate. In the end, <b>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</b> is Williams' third straight winner; although she might not be the most prolific songwriter of the '90s, she's certainly one of the most brilliant.</p>&mdash; <b>Steve Huey</b>"

Subtle and often stark, Essence is an unusually quiet and frequently downbeat set that depicts a fragile emotional vulnerability which rarely makes its presence felt in Williams' music; there's an unadorned longing in songs like ~Blue~ and ~Lonely Girls~ that's new and deeply affecting, and the leaf-in-the-breeze quaver of Williams' voice on ~I Envy the Wind~ is as heart-rending as anything she's ever committed to tape. But while a blue mood dominates <i>Essence</i>, this isn't an album about the blue funk of heartbreak, but a chronicle of the search for transcendence over sorrow in our lives, as her characters look for a path out of isolation (~Out of Touch~), try to find answers through faith (~Get Right With God~), or reconcile love with the desires of the flesh (~Essence~). As a songwriter, Williams has long shown a knack for charting the human heart and mind with intelligence and economy, and Essence finds her at the peak of her form; the delicacy of this music does not speak of weakness, but of the passion and bravery it takes to bare one's soul. And while Williams has gained a certain infamy for her obsessive perfectionism in the studio, the quality of her work speaks for the wisdom of her decision-making process, and Essence proves how well she understands the art of recording; producing in collaboration with Charlie Sexton (Tom Tucker and Bo Ramsey also contributed), Essence sounds full and rich even in its quietest moments, and her sweet-and-sour voice blends with the arrangements with subtle perfection. Those hoping for another dose of the bluesy roots rock of <i>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</i> may be disappointed, but if you want to take a deep and compelling look into the heart and soul of a major artist, then you owe it to yourself to hear Essence.</p>— <b>Mark Deming</b>"

				"review": "<p>Lucinda Williams has earned a reputation for her meticulous approach to making albums, but a careful listen to her work suggests that she isn't trying to make her music sound perfect, she just wants it to sound right, and she isn't afraid to spend the extra time waiting for the charmed moment to get caught on tape. This attitude seems to be borne out in her first-ever concert album, <i>Live @ The Fillmore</i>, which manages to sound carefully considered, and a model of ~warts and all~ authenticity at the same time. Recorded during a three-night stand in San Francisco, the album captures Williams' band in superb form -- Doug Pettibone's guitars, Taras Prodaniuk's bass, and Jim Christie's drums merge into a tight and emphatic groove machine that can match Williams's many moods, whether she's quietly contemplative on ~Blue,~ rocking out hard on ~Changed the Locks,~ or howling the blues on ~Essence,~ while the deeply resonant recording and mix gives them the royal treatment. Williams herself is a slightly more complicated matter here -- her performance is deeply into the spirit, so much so that sometimes her melismatic wanderings and broad phrasing sound like they're verging on caricature. But this is clearly a recording of a performance, and by the time we get to the end of disc two, the broad strokes have coalesced into something quite remarkable; as Williams searches through the nooks and crannies of her songs, you sense she's discovering things that she didn't expect to find, and it's a tremendous thing to hear. Lucinda Williams is an artist who writes from her soul, and she's thoroughly unafraid of letting her passion show when she sings. If that makes for strained technique, it also results in very real art, and this album offers a privileged glimpse of a singular songwriter in full flight.</p>&mdash; <b>Mark Deming</b>"

				"review": "<P>While many considered Car Wheels on a Gravel Road and Essence as definitive statements of arrival for Lucinda Williams as a pop star, she ~arrived~ creatively with her self-titled album in 1984 and opened up a further world of possibilities with Sweet Old World. The latter two records merely cemented a reputation that was well-deserved from the outset, though they admittedly confused some of her earliest fans. World Without Tears is the most immediate, unpolished album she's done since Sweet Old World. In addition, it is simply the bravest, most emotionally wrenching record she's ever issued. It offers unflinching honesty regarding the paradoxes inherent in love as both a necessary force for fulfillment and a destructive one when embraced unconsciously. Fans of her more polished, emotionally yearning material may have a hard time here because there isn't one track — of 13 — that isn't right from the gut, ripped open, bleeding, and stripped of metaphors and literary allusions; they're all cut with the fineness of a stiletto slicing through white bone into the heart's blood. World Without Tears is, among other things, predominantly about co-dependent, screwed-up love. It's about relationships that begin seemingly innocently and well-intentioned and become overwhelmingly powerful emotionally and transcendent sexually, until the moment where a fissure happens, baggage gets dumped in the space between lovers, and they turn in on themselves, becoming twisted and destructive — where souls get scorched and bodies feel the addictive, obsessive need to be touched by a now absent other. The whole experience burns to ashes; it becomes a series of tattoos disguised as scars. The experience is lived through with shattering pain and bewilderment until wrinkled wisdom emerges on the other side. Most of Williams' albums have one song that deals with this theme, but with the exception of a couple of songs, here they all do.</P><P>Musically, this is the hardest-rocking record she's ever released, though almost half the songs are ballads. Her road band — on record with her for the first time — cut this one live from the studio floor adding keyboards and assorted sonic textures later. The energy here just crackles. Sure, there's gorgeous country and folk music here. ~Ventura,~ with its lilting verse and lap steel whining in the background, is a paean to be swallowed up in the ocean of love's embrace. In fact, it's downright prosaic until she gets to the last verse: ~Stand in the shower to clean this dirty mess/Give me back my power and drown this unholiness/Lean over the toilet bowl and throw up my confession/Cleanse my soul of this hidden obsession.~ The melodic frame is still moving, but the tune reverses itself: It's no longer a broken-hearted ballad, but a statement of purpose and survival. ~Fruits of My Labor~ is a straight-ahead country song. Williams shimmers with her lyric, her want pouring from her mouth like raw dripping honey. Her words are a poetry of want: ~I traced your scent through the gloom/Till I found these purple flowers/I was spent, I was soon smelling you for hours...I've been trying to enjoy all the fruits of my labor/I've been cryin' for you boy, but truth is my savior.~ One can hear the grain of Loretta Lynn's voice, with an intent so pure and unadorned. But the muck and mire of ~Righteously,~ with its open six-string squall, is pure rock. It's an exhortation to a lover that he need not prove his manhood by being aloof, but to ~be the man you ought to tenderly/Stand up for me.~ Doug Pettibone's overdriven, crunching guitar solo quotes both Duane Allman and Jimi Hendrix near the end of the tune. ~Real Live Bleeding Fingers and Broken Guitar Strings~ is a Rolling Stones-style country-rocker with a lyric so poignant it need not be quoted here. ~Over Time,~ a tome about getting through the heartbreak of a ruined relationship, could have been produced by Daniel Lanois with its warm guitar tremolo and sweet, pure, haunting vocal in front of the mix.</P><P>~Those Three Days~ may be the most devastating song on the record, with its whimpering lap steel and Williams' half-spoken vocal that questions whether a torrid three-day affair was a lie, a symbolic sacrifice, or the real thing. The protagonist's vulnerability is radical; she feels used, abused — ~Did you only want me for those three days/Did you only need me for those three days/Did you love me forever just for those three days.~ Yet she holds out hope that there is some other explanation as the questions begin to ask themselves from the depth of a scorched heart and a body touched by something so powerful it feels as if it no longer owns itself. Pettibone's solo screams and rings in the bridge to underline every syllable and emotion. ~Atonement~ is something else altogether; it's a punkish kind of blues. If the White Stripes jammed with 20 Miles in a big studio it might sound like this, with Williams singing from the depths of a tunnel for a supreme megaphone effect. She growls and shouts and spits her lyrics from the center of the mix. And Taras Prodaniuk's fuzzed-out basement-level gutter bass is the dirtiest, raunchiest thing on record since early Black Sabbath. ~Sweet Side~ is almost a poem in song, attempts to inspire someone who's been broken by life to accept his goodness. It is not a rap song despite what's been written about it so far. It's more in the tradition of Bob Dylan's early talking blues, but with a modern organic rhythm played by Jim Christie instead of drum loops. In addition, there is the gorgeously tough ~People Talking,~ the most straight-ahead country song Williams has written since ~Still I Long for Your Kiss~ (from the Horse Whisperer soundtrack, not the version that appears on Car Wheels, which is dull and lifeless by comparison). Here again, Pettibone's guitar and the slippery, skittering shuffle of Christie's drumming carry Williams' voice to a place where she can sing her protagonist's personal, soul-searing truth without restraint.</P><P>World Without Tears is a work of art in the Henry James sense; it is ~that which can never be repeated.~ It is as fine an album as she could make at this point in her life — which is saying plenty. While she has never strayed from her own vision and has made few compromises, this album risks everything she's built up to now. The audience she's won over time — especially with her last two records — may find it over the top, which would be too damn bad; it'd be their loss. Hopefully, history will prove that World Without Tears sets a new watermark for Williams, and is an album so thoroughly ahead of its time in the way it embraces, and even flaunts, love's contradictions and paradoxes — the same way the human heart does. It is this writer's hope that people will be listening to and learning from it for years to come.</P><P>— <B>Thom Jurek</B></P>"

				"review": "<P>The title of West reflects the change in Lucinda Williams' life as she moved to Los Angeles. It also reflects what had been left behind. Williams is nothing if not a purely confessional songwriter. She continually walks in the shadowlands to bring out what is both most personal yet universal in her work, to communicate to listeners directly and without compromise. If Essence and World Without Tears took chances and stated different sides of the songwriter and her world, West jumps off the ledge into the sky of freedom, where anything can be said without worry of consequence and where anything can be said in any way she wishes. It's entirely appropriate that West was released on the day before Valentine's Day 2007, for it's a record about the heart, about its volumes of brokenness, about its acceptance of its state, and how, with the scars still visible to the bearer, it opens wider and becomes the font of love itself. But the journey is a dark one. First there's the music and the production. Williams chose Hal Willner to produce West. Williams, who'd been writing a lot, demoed some songs before she brought in Willner. He stripped down the demos but kept the scratch vocals. From there, the pair created the rest of the album together, never re-recording Williams' initial vocals. The vocals were accompanied by her guitar playing; Willner wanted her inherent phrasing and rhythmic flow. Willner also brought his own crew to play with Williams. This collaboration -- as unlikely as it might seem on the surface -- results in something utterly different and yet unmistakably Lucinda Williams. West is a warm, inviting, yet very dark record about grief, the loss of love, anger at a lover who cannot deliver, and embracing the possibility of change. In other words, it's not without its redemptive moments. Williams has put all of her qualities on display at once with an unbridled and unbowed sense of adventure here on her eighth album. She, her bandmates, and Willner have come up with exactly what pop music needs: a real work of art based in contemporary forms and feelings. West is Lucinda Williams' magnum opus thus far, an album that will no doubt attract more than a few new fans, and will give old ones, if they are open enough, a recording to relish. West is flawless; it is actually destined to become a classic.</P><P>— <B>Thom Jurek</B></P>"

Musically, 35 years after its original release, Second Winter is still an oddity. Issued by Sony's Legacy division, the set has been painstakingly remastered, and expanded by bonus cuts and an entire disc of live material. It's too bluesed-out to be a pure rock record, and too psychedelically dimensioned to be a pure blues album. Tommy Shannon calls it ~power blues.~ And as for whatever else passed for blues-rock at the time -- Cream, Hendrix, Canned Heat, etc. -- forget it. This set is a whole different animal. Cut in Nashville with all tracks begin done within one or two takes, the energy of Second Winter is undeniable. The sheer range of styles Winter assaulted in his restless quest is astonishing too.</p><p>The set begins with a blues-funk cover of Percy Mayfield's classic ~Memory Pain,~ that adds a wealth of rock sonics to the mix. The same goes for the gritty originals like ~I'm Not Sure,~ with its screaming electric mandolin, and the album's closer ~Fast Life Rider.~ The latter two are textured with Edgar's stellar piano work. Then there's the album's centerpiece, the signature cover of Bob Dylan's ~Highway 61 Revisited~ with its burning, gut bucket slide work and Winter's bona fide revival of Chuck Berry's ~Johnny B. Goode.~ Trad Delta blues makes its appearance here as well in ~I Love Everybody,~ as does jump jazz in ~I Hate Everybody,~ both of them with Winter's raucous edge. The original album is buoyed here with a pair of bonus tracks, an instrumental version of Ray Charles' ~Tell the Truth,~ as well as the jump blues classic ~Early in the Morning.~ Disc two in the set is an entire unreleased concert from the Royal Albert Hall in 1970 with the same band The show is a monster showcasing all the fiery craziness of Winter's nearly unbelievable guitar mastery on tracks such as ~Mean Town Blues,~ ~Black Cat Bone,~ ~It's My Own Fault,~ ~Tobacco Road,~ and ~Johnny B. Goode.~ It is also significant for the early performance of Edgar's classic, ~Frankenstein~ -- it's a very different, and preferable -- version than the one recorded in the studio. All in all, fantastic sound, an excellent package, and good notes by Andy Aledort make this a welcome addition to the classic rock canon.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

		"biography": "<p>As a solo artist, Steve Winwood is primarily associated with the highly polished blue-eyed soul-pop that made him a star in the '80s. Yet his turn as a slick, upscale mainstay of adult contemporary radio was simply the latest phase of a long and varied career, one that's seen the former teenage R&B shouter move through jazz, psychedelia, blues-rock, and progressive rock. Possessed of a powerful, utterly distinctive voice, Winwood was also an excellent keyboardist who remained an in-demand session musician for most of his career, even while busy with high-profile projects. That background wasn't necessarily apparent on his solo records, which established a viable commercial formula that was tremendously effective as long as it was executed with commitment.</p><p>Stephen Lawrence Winwood was born May 12, 1948, in the Handsworth area of Birmingham, England. First interested in swing and Dixieland jazz, he began playing drums, guitar, and piano as a child, and first performed with his father and older brother Muff in the Ron Atkinson Band at the age of eight. During the early '60s, Muff led a locally popular group called the Muff Woody Jazz Band, and allowed young Steve to join; eventually they began to add R&B numbers to their repertoire, and in 1963 the brothers chose to pursue that music full-time, joining guitarist Spencer Davis to form the Spencer Davis Group. Although he was only 15, Steve's vocals were astoundingly soulful and mature, and his skills at the piano were also advanced beyond his years. Within a year, he'd played with numerous American blues legends both in concert and in the studio; in 1965, he also recorded the solo single ~Incense~ as the Anglos, crediting himself as Stevie Anglo. Meanwhile, the Spencer Davis Group released a handful of classic R&B-styled singles, including ~Keep on Running,~ ~I'm a Man,~ and the monumental ~Gimme Some Lovin',~ which stood with any of the gritty hardcore soul music coming out of the American South.</p><p>Winwood eventually tired of the tight pop-single format; by the mid-'60s, the cutting edge of rock & roll often involved stretching out instrumentally, and with his roots in jazz, Winwood wanted the same opportunity. Accordingly, he left the Spencer Davis Group in 1967 to form Traffic with guitarist Dave Mason, horn player Chris Wood, and drummer Jim Capaldi, all of whom had played on ~Gimme Some Lovin'.~ The quartet retired to a small cottage in the Berkshire countryside, where they could work out their sound — a unique blend of R&B, Beatlesque pop, psychedelia, jazz, and British folk — and jam long into the night without angering neighbors. Traffic debuted in the U.K. with the single ~Paper Sun~ in May 1967, and soon issued their debut album <i>Mr. Fantasy</i> (retitled Heaven Is in Your Mind in the U.S.); it was followed by the jazzy psychedelic classic <i>Traffic</i> in 1968. However, conflicts had arisen between Winwood and Mason over the latter's tightly constructed folk-pop songs, which didn't fit into Winwood's expansive, jam-oriented conception of the band. Mason left, returned, and was fired again, and Winwood broke up the band at the beginning of 1969. Even so, by that time, he had become the unofficial in-house keyboardist for Traffic's label Island, playing at numerous recording sessions.</p><p>Winwood subsequently hooked up with old friend Eric Clapton, who'd recently parted ways with Cream. The two began jamming and found that they enjoyed working together, and rumors of their collaboration spread like wildfire; the enormous anticipation only grew when ex-Cream drummer Ginger Baker signed on, despite Clapton's misgivings over the expectations that would create. Concert promoters rushed to book the band before any material had been completed (hence the band's eventual name, Blind Faith), and offered too much money for them to refuse, despite their lack of rehearsal time. Their self-titled debut, released in the summer of 1969, was a hit, but the extreme pressure on the group led to their breakup even before the end of the year. Winwood joined Baker in a large, eclectic new supergroup called Ginger Baker's Air Force, but Winwood still had contract obligations to Island, and he left not long after Air Force's debut performance at the Royal Albert Hall in early 1970.</p><p>Winwood began work on what was slated to be his first solo LP, but he gradually brought in more ex-Traffic members to help him out, to the point where the album simply became a band reunion. <i>John Barleycorn Must Die</i> was released later in 1970, showcasing the sort of jam-happy jazz-rock sound that Winwood had in mind for the group from the start. Several more albums in that vein followed, including 1971's <i>The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys</i>, which brought Traffic to the peak of their commercial popularity in America. The run was briefly interrupted by Winwood's bout with peritonitis around 1972, but he'd recovered enough to play a major role in Eric Clapton's early-1973 comeback concerts at the Rainbow Theatre. Traffic broke up in 1974, but instead of going solo right away, an exhausted Winwood spent the next few years as a session musician, relaxing on his Gloucestershire farm during his spare time. He also featured prominently as a collaborator with Japanese percussionist Stomu Yamash'ta, appearing on his hit jazz fusion LP, <i>Go</i>, in 1976.</p><p>When Winwood finally returned with his self-titled solo debut in 1977, Britain was in the midst of the punk revolution, and the music itself was somewhat disappointing even to Winwood himself. Dismayed, he returned to Gloucestershire and all but disappeared from music. He returned in late 1980 with the little-heralded <i>Arc of a Diver</i>, a much stronger effort on which he played every instrument himself. Modernizing Winwood's sound with more synthesizers and electronic percussion, <i>Arc of a Diver</i> was a platinum-selling hit in the U.S., helped by the hit single ~While You See a Chance~; it received highly positive reviews as well, most hailing the freshness of Winwood's newly contemporary sound. The extremely similar 1982 follow-up <i>Talking Back to the Night</i> sounded rushed to some reviewers, and it wasn't nearly as big a hit, with none of its singles reaching the Top 40. Unhappy with the record, Winwood even considered retiring to become a producer (though his brother talked him out of it).</p><p>Taking more time to craft his next album, Winwood didn't return until 1986, with an album of slickly crafted, sophisticated pop called <i>Back in the High Life</i>, which was his first '80s album to feature outside session musicians. It was a smash hit, selling over three-million copies and producing Winwood's first number one single in ~Higher Love,~ which also won a Grammy for Record of the Year. In 1987, Virgin offered Winwood a substantial sum of money and successfully pried him away from Island; a remixed version of <i>Talking Back to the Night's</i> ~Valerie,~ featured on the Island-greatest-hits compilation <i>Chronicles</i>, became a Top Ten hit later that year. Winwood's hot streak continued with his first album for Virgin, 1988's <i>Roll With It</i>. The title track became his second number one and his biggest hit ever, and the album topped the charts as well; plus, the smoky ballad ~Don't You Know What the Night Can Do?~ was featured in a prominent TV ad campaign. Winwood had by now established a large, mostly adult fan base, but that support began to slip with his next album, 1990's <i>Refugees of the Heart</i>. Refugees repeated the slick blue-eyed soul updates of its predecessor, but according to most reviewers it simply wasn't performed with the same passion, save for the lead single ~One and Only Man,~ a collaboration with Traffic mate Jim Capaldi.</p><p>Afterward, Winwood continued his pattern of following disappointments with periods of inactivity; he next resurfaced in 1994 as part of a Traffic reunion with Capaldi. Together they released the new album, <i>Far From Home</i>, and toured the world. Winwood subsequently returned to his solo career and spent two years working on <i>Junction Seven</i>, which finally appeared in 1997 and was co-produced by Narada Michael Walden. However, his momentum had stalled, and the album — which received mixed reviews — failed to sell well. The following year, Winwood toured with his new project Latin Crossings, a jazz group that also featured Tito Puente and Arturo Sandoval (though they never recorded). He subsequently parted ways with Virgin. </p>&mdash; <b>Steve Huey</b>",

He was a half-forgotten ex-member of some of rock's most progressive (Traffic) and vilified (Blind Faith) bands, and he was considering leaving show business while recording this--his second album--alone and without a backup band. Arc of a Diver reflects a resigned-to-fate mood. It boasts a synth-heavy, dub-like ambience, with dirge-y tracks like ~Spanish Dancer~ and the wistful single ~While You See a Chance~ all but zoning out of your speakers. The fates were kind, though. Recording the single, Winwood inadvertently erased the drum intro. This spacey alteration, together with his catchiest tune since ~Paper Sun,~ catapulted the song onto the charts. In a few years he would be among the top-selling vocalists in the world. His mood was lighter. He could afford to hire engineers that didn't make mistakes.</P>&mdash; <B>Don Harrison</B>"

				"review": "<p>Steve Winwood took an extended break after the ignoble flop of 1997's <I>Junction Seven</I>, resurfacing on his own indie label Wincraft six years later with About Time. Where his last major-label effort fell prey to many of the trappings of a veteran artist gunning for the charts one last time — an overly slick Narada Michael Waldenproduction, cameos from Des'ree and Lenny Kravitz, songs that were too slick and unmemorable — About Time finds Winwood scaling back things considerably, keeping himself to a trio featuring him on a Hammond organ, drummer Walfredo Reyes Jr., and guitarist José Piresde Almeida Neto. Occasionally, congas and timbales and other percussion flesh out the rhythm, while Karl Denson plays flute or saxophone elsewhere, but these are subtle additions to a loose, laid-back, intimate album that harks back to Traffic, even if it is never as freewheeling or unpredictable as that band.</p> <p>Winwood's ambitions with About Time are pretty modest, actually — to cut R&amp;B-based tunes that bring in jazz and Latin influences and give everybody the chance to jam. Though they meander a bit too much at times, the jams are warm and appealing, and while the songs are a little indistinct, the feel of the music is good, which counts for a lot, since the last two slick solo albums felt distant (surely a byproduct of records that were designed to be <i>Roll With It</i>, Pt. 2). If Winwood's voice is now a little rough (which comes as a surprise), it nevertheless fits the scaled-down, relaxed atmosphere. And if individual songs aren't necessarily memorable, they don'tnecessarily need to be — the feel is the thing here, and while it isn't first-rate Steve Winwood, it does feel like a welcome update from an old friend, which, after several years of waiting and several uneven records, is enough.</p><p> — <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b></p>"

				"review": "<p>When Stevie Wonder applied his tremendous songwriting talents to the unsettled social morass that was the early '70s, he produced one of his greatest, most important works, a rich panoply of songs addressing drugs, spirituality, political ethics, the unnecessary perils of urban life, and what looked to be the failure of the '60s dream -- all set within a collection of charts as funky and catchy as any he'd written before. Two of the highlights, ~Living for the City~ and ~Too High,~ make an especially deep impression thanks to Stevie's narrative talents; on the first, an eight-minute mini-epic, he brings a hard-scrabble Mississippi black youth to the city and illustrates, via a brilliant dramatic interlude, what lies in wait for innocents. (He also uses his variety of voice impersonations to stunning effect.) ~Too High~ is just as stunning, a cautionary tale about drugs driven by a dizzying chorus of scat vocals and a springing bassline. ~Higher Ground,~ a funky follow-up to the previous album's big hit (~Superstition~), and ~Jesus Children of America~ both introduced Wonder's interest in Eastern religion. It's a tribute to his genius that he could broach topics like reincarnation and transcendental meditation in a pop context with minimal interference to the rest of the album. Wonder also made no secret of the fact that ~He's Misstra Know-It-All~ was directed at Tricky Dick, aka Richard Milhouse Nixon, then making headlines (and destroying America's faith in the highest office) with the biggest political scandal of the century. Putting all these differing themes and topics into perspective was the front cover, a striking piece by Efram Wolff portraying Stevie Wonder as the blind visionary, an artist seeing far better than those around him what was going on in the early '70s, and using his astonishing musical gifts to make this commentary one of the most effective and entertaining ever heard.</p><p>&mdash; <b>John Bush</b></p>"

		"biography": "<p>Far and away the longest lasting and the most successful of the '70s progressive rock groups, Yes proved one of the lingering success stories from that musical genre. The band, founded in 1968, overcame a generational shift in its audience and the departure of its most visible members at key points in its history to reach the end of the century as the definitive progressive rock band. Where rivals such as Emerson, Lake & Palmer withered away commercially after the mid-'70s, and Genesis and King Crimson altered their sounds so radically as to become unrecognizable to their original fans, Yes retained the same sound, and performed much of the same repertory that they were doing in 1971; and for their trouble, they found themselves being taken seriously a quarter of a century later. Their audience remains huge because they've always attracted younger listeners drawn to their mix of daunting virtuosity, cosmic (often mystical) lyrics, complex musical textures, and powerful yet delicate lead vocals.</p><p>Lead singer Jon Anderson (b. Oct. 25, 1944, Accrington, Lancashire) started out during the British beat boom as a member of the Warriors, who recorded a single for Decca in 1964; and later was in the band Gun, before going solo in 1967 with two singles on the Parlophone label. He was making a meager living cleaning up at a London club called La Chasse during June of 1968, and was thinking of starting up a new band. One day at the bar, he chanced to meet bassist/vocalist Chris Squire, a former member of the band the Syn, who had recorded for Deram, the progressive division of Decca.</p><p>The two learned that they shared several musical interests, including an appreciation for the harmony singing of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel, and within a matter of days were trying to write songs together. They began developing the beginnings of a sound that incorporated harmonies with a solid-rock backing, rooted in Squire's very precise approach to the bass. Anderson and Squire saw the groups around them as having either strong vocals and weak instrumental backup, or powerful backup and weak lead vocals, and they sought to combine the best of both. Their initial inspiration, at least as far as the precision of their vocals, according to Squire, was the pop/soul act the Fifth Dimension.</p><p>They recruited Tony Kaye (b. Jan. 11, 1946), formerly of the Federals, on keyboards; Peter Banks (b. July 7, 1947), previously a member of the Syn, on guitar; and drummer Bill Bruford (b. May 17, 1948), who had only just joined the blues band Savoy Brown a few weeks earlier. The name Yes was chosen for the band as something short, direct, and memorable.<p>The British music scene at this time was in a state of flux. The pop/psychedelic era, with its pretty melodies and delicate sounds, was drawing to a close, replaced by the heavier sounds of groups like Cream. Progressive rock, with a heavy dose of late-19th-century classical music, was also starting to make a noise that was being heard, in the guise of acts such as the Nice, featuring Keith Emerson, and the original Deep Purple.</p><p>The group's break came in October of 1968 when the band, on the recommendation of the Nice's manager, Tony Stratton-Smith (later the founder of Charisma Records), played a gig at the Speakeasy Club in London, filling in for an absent Sly & the Family Stone. The group was later selected to open for Cream's November 26, 1968, farewell concert at Royal Albert Hall. This concert, in turn, led to a residency at London's Marquee Club and their first radio appearance, on John Peel's Top Gear radio show. They subsequently opened for Janis Joplin at her Royal Albert Hall concert in April 1969, and were signed to Atlantic Records soon after.</p><p>Their debut single, and Anderson and Squire's first song, entitled ~Sweetness,~ was released soon after. Their first album, <i>Yes</i>, was released in November of 1969. The record displayed the basic sound that would characterize the band's subsequent records; including impeccable high harmonies; clearly defined, emphatic playing; and an approach to music that derived from folk and classical, far more than the R&B from which most rock music sprung, but it was much more in a pop-music context, featuring covers of Beatles and Byrds songs. Also present was a hint of the space rock sound (on ~Beyond and Before~) in which they would later come to specialize.</p><p>Anderson's falsetto lead vocals gave the music an ethereal quality, while Banks' angular guitar, seemingly all picked and none strummed, drew from folk and skiffle elements. Squire's bass had a huge sound, owing to his playing with a pick, giving him one of the most distinctive sounds on the instrument this side of the Who's John Entwistle; while Bruford's drumming was very complex within the pop-song context; and Kaye's playing was rich and melodic.</p><p>In February of 1970, Yes supported the Nice at their Royal Albert Hall show, while they were preparing their second album, <i>Time and a Word</i>. By the time it was released in June of 1970, Peter Banks had left the lineup, to be replaced by guitarist Steve Howe (b. Apr. 8, 1947), a former member of the Syndicats, the In Crowd, Tomorrow (~My White Bicycle~), and Bodast. Howe is pictured with the group on the jacket of <i>Time and a Word</i>, which was released in August, and played his first show with the group at Queen Elizabeth Hall on March 21, 1970, but Banks actually played on the album. This record was far more sophisticated than its predecessor, and even included an overdubbed orchestra on some songs, the only time that Yes would rely on outside musicians to augment their sound. The cosmic and mystical elements of their songwriting were even more evident on this album.</p><p>The group's fame in England continued to rise as they became an increasingly popular concert attraction, especially after they were seen by millions as the opening act for Iron Butterfly. It was with the release of <i>The Yes Album</i> in April of 1971 that the public began to glimpse the group's full potential.</p><p>That record, made up entirely of original compositions, was filled with complex, multi-part harmonies; loud, heavily layered guitar and bass parts; beautiful and melodic drum parts; and surging organ (with piano embellishments) passages bridging them all. Everybody was working on a far more expansive level than on any of their previous recordings: on ~Your Move~ (which became the group's first U.S. chart entry, at number 40), the harmonies were woven together in layers and patterns that were dazzling in their own right; while ~Starship Trooper~ (which drew its name from a Robert Heinlein novel, thus reinforcing the group's space rock image) and ~All Good People~ gave Howe, Squire, and Bruford the opportunity to play extended instrumental passages of tremendous forcefulness. ~Starship Trooper,~ ~I've Seen All Good People,~ ~Perpetual Change,~ and ~Yours Is No Disgrace~ also became parts of the group's concert sets for years to come.</p><p><i>The Yes Album</i> opened a new phase in the group's history and its approach to music. None of it was pop music in the ~Top 40~ sense of the term. Rather, it was built on compositions which resembled sound paintings, rather than songs; the swelling sound of Kaye's Moog synthesizer and organ, Howe's fluid yet stinging guitar passages, Squire's rippling bass, and Anderson's haunting falsetto leads all evoked sonic landscapes that were strangely compelling to the imagination of the listener.</p><p><i>The Yes Album</i> reached number seven in England in the spring of 1971; later, it got to number 40 in America. Early in 1971, Yes made their first U.S. tour opening for Jethro Tull, and they were back late in the year sharing billing with Ten Years After and the J. Geils Band. The band began work on their next album, but were interrupted when keyboard player Tony Kaye quit in August of 1971 to join ex-Yes guitarist Peter Banks in the group Flash. He was replaced by former Strawbs keyboard player Rick Wakeman, who played his first shows with the band in September and October of 1971.</p><p>Wakeman was a far more flamboyant musician than Kaye, not only in his approach to playing but the number of instruments that he used and the way he played them. In place of the three keyboards that Kaye used, Wakeman used an entire bank of upwards of a dozen instruments, including Mellotron, various synthesizers, organ, two or more pianos, and electric harpsichord. This lineup, Anderson Squire, Howe, Wakeman, and Bruford, which actually only lasted for one year, from August of 1971 until August of 1972, is generally considered the best of all the Yes configurations, and the strongest incarnation of the band.</p><p>The group completed their next album, <i>Fragile</i>, in less than two months, partly out of a need to get a new album out to help pay for all of Wakeman's equipment. And partly due to this haste, the new album featured only four tracks by the group as a whole, ~Roundabout,~ ~The South Side of the Sky,~ ~Heart of the Sunrise,~ and ~Long Distance Runaround~ — although, significantly, all except ~Long Distance Runaround~ ran between seven and 13 minutes — and was rounded out by five pieces showcasing each member of the band individually. Anderson's voice was represented in multiple overdubs on ~We Have Heaven,~ while Squire's bass provided the instrumental ~The Fish,~ which later became an important part of the group's concerts; Howe's ~Mood for a Day~ showed him off as a classical guitarist; Bruford's drums were the focus of ~Five Percent for Nothing~; and Wakeman turned in ~Cans and Brahms,~ an electronic keyboard fantasy built on one movement from Brahms' Fourth Symphony.</p><p>Fragile, released in December of 1971, reached number seven in England and number four in America. The album's success was enhanced by the release of an edited single of ~Roundabout,~ the group's first (and, for over a decade, only) major hit, which reached number 13 on the U.S. charts. For millions of listeners, ~Roundabout,~ with its crisp interwoven acoustic and electric guitar parts and very vivid bass textures, exquisite vocals (especially the harmonies), swirling keyboard passages, and brisk beat, proved an ideal introduction to the group's sound. Neither Emerson, Lake & Palmer nor King Crimson, the group's leading rivals at that time, ever had so successful a pop-chart entry. The single's impact among teenage and college-age listeners was far greater than this chart position would indicate; they simply flocked to the band, with the result that not only did Fragile sell in huge numbers, but the group's earlier records (especially The Yes Album) were suddenly in demand again.</p><p>Even the album's jacket, designed by artist Roger Dean, featured distinctive, surreal landscape graphics, which evoked images seemingly related to the music inside. These paintings would become part-and-parcel with the audience's impression of Yes' music, and later tours by the group would feature stage sets designed by Dean as an integral part of their shows.</p><p>The group's appeal was multi-level. In some ways, they were the successors to psychedelic metal bands such as Iron Butterfly; ~Roundabout~ may have been space rock, with a driving beat that carried the listener soaring into the heavens, but lines like ~In and around the lake/Mountains come out of the sky/they stand there~ evoked a surreal imagery not far removed (in the minds of some listeners) from ~In a Gadda Da Vida~; and just as effective, amid Wakeman's swirling synthesizer and Mellotron passages, as a musical background for any druggy indulgences that fans might pursue. These would also be among the last lyrics that fans of the band would have to deal with, apart from anomalies such as the ethereal ~I get up/I get down~ from ~<i>Close to the Edge</i>~ or the topical ~Don't Kill the Whale~; on most of the band's future releases, and for much of this song as well, Anderson's voice was part of the overall mix of sounds generated by Yes. Some of his lyrics in future years were worth a detailed look, however, often possessing complex subtexts drawn from religious and literary sources which made them good for intellectual analysis, and something that college students could listen to with no shame or rationalizing. In that respect, Yes were as much the successors to the Moody Blues, with a beat and balls in place of the pioneering art rock/psychedelic band's stateliness and overt seriousness, as they were to Iron Butterfly.</p><p>Jon Anderson's falsetto vocals, moreover, compared very well with those of his Atlantic Records stablemate Robert Plant, the lead singer of Led Zeppelin. Their classical music influences offered a level of intellectual stimulation that Led Zeppelin seldom bothered with. And Yes played loud and hard; they were progressive, but they weren't wimps, and they put on a better show than Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Their music seemed to evoke the most appealing elements of heavy metal rock, psychedelic music, the work of composers as different as Igor Stravinsky and film composer Jerome Moross (whose ~Main Theme From the Big Country~ provided the basis for the group's version of ~No Experience Necessary~), and Eastern religion, all wrapped in songs running upwards of 22 minutes, an entire side of an album.</p><p>~Roundabout~ would be the group's biggest single success for the next 12 years, but it was more than enough. Although they would continue to release 45s periodically, including a cover of Paul Simon's ~America~ during the summer of 1972, Yes' future clearly lay with their albums. On Fragile, ~Long Distance Runaround,~ as a three-minute song, had been the anomaly; the band was clearly looking at longer forms in which to write and play their music.</p><p><i>Close to the Edge</i>, recorded in the late spring of 1972 and released in September of that year, showed just where they were headed; consisting of only three long tracks, essentially three sound paintings, in which the overall sound and musical textures mattered more than the lyrics or any specific melody, harmonization, or solo. ~Siberian Khatru~ was almost a rock adaptation of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, recalling the composer's most famous work and sounding as though Anderson and company had tapped into a element of ritual and a state of consciousness going back practically to the dawn of time (or stretching to the end of time); while ~And You and I~ seemed to take ~Your Move~ to a newly cosmic level. The fans and critics alike loved <i>Close to the Edge</i>, resplendent in its rich harmonies and keyboard passages of astonishing beauty and complexity, brittle but powerful guitar, and drumming that was gorgeous in its own right. The album reached number four in England and number three in the United States without help from a hit single (though an edited version of ~And You and I~ did reach number 42 in America).</p><p>By the time of the record's release, however, Bill Bruford had left the band to join King Crimson, and was replaced by Alan White (b. June 14, 1949, Pelton, Durham), a session drummer who was previously best known for having played with John Lennon and Yoko Ono's Plastic Ono Band. With White — who was a powerful player, but lacked the subtle melodic technique of Bill Bruford — installed at the drum kit, the group went on tour behind the new album to massive audience response and critical acclaim. As an added bonus for fans, Rick Wakeman had completed his first solo LP, the instrumental concept album <I>The Six Wives of Henry VIII</I>, which was released by A&M Records in February of 1973 (Wakeman had played excerpts from it during his featured solo spot during the previous Yes tour).</p><p>A large part of the <i>Close to the Edge</i> tour, like the group's prior tour with Bruford on the drums, was recorded, and a three-LP (two-CD) set entitled <i>Yessongs</i>, released in May of 1973, was assembled from the best work on the tour. <i>Yessongs</i> became a model for progressive rock live albums; at over 120 minutes, it included the band's entire stage repertory (not coincidentally, the best songs from the three preceding albums), all of it uncut and all of it well-played. The live album reached number seven in England and number 12 in the United States.</p><p>The group spent the second half of 1973 trying to come up with a follow-up to four successive hit albums. The resulting record, a double LP entitled <i>Tales From Topographic Oceans</i>, was released in January of 1974 with such high expectations, that it earned a gold record from its advanced orders.</p><p><i>Tales From Topographic Oceans</i> broke all previous artistic boundaries, consisting of four long tracks each taking up the full side of an LP, with titles like ~The Revealing Science of God (Dance of the Dawn).~ If the group's prior albums were made up of paintings in sound, then Topographic Oceans was a series of sonic murals, painted across vast spaces on a massive scale that did not make for light listening. If this all seems ridiculously overblown today, perhaps it was, but this work was being done in an era in which groups like Emerson, Lake, & Palmer were recording album-length suites and stretching relatively modest works such as ~Fanfare for the Common Man~ by Aaron Copland into ten-minute epics. The group believed it had cultivated an audience for such music, and they were right; Topographic Oceans not only topped the British charts but reached number six on the American charts.</p><p>No album has more divided both fans and critics of Yes alike. At the time of its release, critics called <i>Tales From Topographic Oceans</i> excessive, representing the height of progressive rock's self-indulgent nature. Originally inspired by Jon Anderson's reaction to a set of Shastric scriptures, the album displayed a sublime beauty in many parts, and immense, mesmerizing stretches of high-energy virtuosity for most of its length.</p><p>The group toured behind Topographic Oceans early in 1974, performing most of the album on-stage. Following this tour, plans were announced for each member of the group to release a solo album of his own. At this point, the group faced another major lineup change as Wakeman — whose second solo album, Journey to the Center of the Earth, appeared in May of 1974 — announced that he was leaving Yes' lineup in June to pursue a solo career. In fact, as he revealed in interviews many years later, he'd been very unhappy with the content of <i>Tales From Topographic Oceans</i>, feeling that its music no longer reflected the direction he wanted to go in and that it was time to part company with the band. Wakeman's decision created a major problem for the band, for the keyboard player had become a star within their ranks, and was the group's most well-known individual member; people definitely paid to see and hear his keyboards rippling amid the Yes sound.</p><p>In August of 1974, it was announced that Patrick Moraz (b. June 24, 1948, Morges, Switzerland), formerly of the progressive rock trio Refugee, had replaced Wakeman. Three months later, the group's new album, <i>Relayer</i>, was released, reaching the British number four spot and the American number five position. Moraz proved an adequate replacement for Wakeman, but lacked his predecessor's gift for showmanship and extravagance. The group toured in the wake of <i>Relayer's</i> release in November of 1974, but didn't record together again for two and a half years.</p><p>Indeed, in order to satisfy the demand for more Yes material in the absence of a new album while the group was on the road, Atlantic in March of 1975 released a collection of their early music entitled <i>Yesterdays</i>, drawn from the first two albums and various singles, which rose to number 27 in England and number 17 in America. A film that the group had made along their 1973 tour, entitled <i>Yessongs</i>, was released to theaters at around the same time. The movie received poor reviews, possibly owing to the fact that most reviewers were unfamiliar with the group's music, but it was profitable and has been popular for years on home video.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the absence of new albums by Yes, other bands began trying and capitalize on their own version of the Yes sound. The most notable of these were Starcastle, a progressive rock band signed by Epic Records, who made their recording debut in 1976 with a self-titled album that could've been another incarnation of Yes; and Fireballet, a Passport Records quartet who seemed to bridge the music of Yes and ELP.</p><p>In November of 1975, Chris Squire's <i>Fish Out of Water</i> and Steve Howe's <i>Beginnings</i> were both released and climbed into the mid-60s of the American charts. Squire's record was clearly the more accomplished of the two, virtually a lost Yes album, with the bassist exploring new instrumental and orchestral textures, and turning in a credible vocal performance as well. Howe's record was an interesting, low-key effort that might've impressed other guitarists, but was sorely lacking in the songwriting department.</p><p>These were followed in March of 1976 by Alan White's Ramshackled, which placed at number 41 in England, and Moraz's solo venture <i>Patrick Moraz</i>, which reached number 28 in England and number 132 in America. And in July of 1976, Jon Anderson's <i>Olias of Sunhillow</i>, a dazzling, Tolkien-esque science-fiction/fantasy epic (with packaging on the original LP that must've doubled the basic production cost of the jacket) that sounded as much like a Yes album as any record not made by the entire band could, reached number eight in England and number 47 in America.</p><p>Amid all of these solo projects, the group's lineup changed once again, as Wakeman announced his return to the fold in late 1976, while Moraz exited. Wakeman's original plan was to assist the group in the studio on their new album, but the sessions proved so productive that he made the decision, fully supported by the band, to return to the band's lineup permanently.</p><p>The group's next album, <i>Going for the One</i>, released in August of 1977, represented a much more austere, basic style of rock music, built around shorter songs. The long-player topped the British charts for two weeks and reached number eight on the American charts, while the singles ~Wonderous Stories~ and ~Going for the One~ rose to numbers seven and 24, respectively, in the U.K. The group embarked on a massive tour shortly after the album's release, including their most successful American appearances ever, playing to record audiences on the East Coast.</p><p><i>Tormato</i>, released nearly a year later (heralded by the single ~Don't Kill the Whale,~ the group's first song with a topical message), made the Top Ten in both England and America in the fall of 1978. Once again, after finishing the tour behind the album, the groupmembers began working on solo projects. The year 1979 saw the release of The <i>Steve Howe</i> Album, while early in 1980 Jon Anderson hooked up with Greek-born keyboard player Vangelis. The two released an album, <i>Short Stories</i>, and an accompanying single, ~I Hear You,~ early in 1980, both of which reached the British Top Ten. Jon & Vangelis, as the team became known, went on to cut several more records together.</p><p>In March of 1980, Yes' lineup collapsed, as Wakeman and then Anderson walked out after an unsuccessful attempt to start work on a new album. Two months later, Trevor Horn (vocals, guitar) and Geoff Downes (keyboards), formerly of the British band Buggles, joined the Yes lineup of Steve Howe, Chris Squire, and Alan White. This configuration recorded a new album, <i>Drama</i>, which was released in August of 1980; rather ominously, this record did dramatically better in England, reaching the number two spot, than it did in America, where it got no higher than number 18. This hybrid lineup lasted for a year, but the old Yes incarnation remained much closer to the hearts of fans; in January of 1981 Atlantic Records released Yesshows, a double-live album made up of stage performances dating from 1976 through 1978 that reached number 22 in England and number 43 in America.</p><p>Finally, in April of 1981, the breakup of Yes was announced. Geoff Downes formed Asia with Steve Howe, which went on to some considerable if short-lived success in the early '80s, and the rest of the band scattered to different projects. For a year-and-a-half, the group seemed a dead issue, until Chris Squire and Alan White announced the formation of a new group called Cinema, with original Yes keyboard player Tony Kaye and South African guitarist Trevor Rabin. This band proved unsatisfactory, and Squire invited Jon Anderson to join. It was just about then that everyone realized that they'd re-formed virtually the core of the Yes lineup, and that they should simply revive the name.</p><p>In late 1983, this Yes lineup, with guitarist/vocalist Trevor Horn serving as producer, released an unexpected chart-topping hit (number one in the U.S. in January of 1984) single in ~Owner of a Lonely Heart,~ displaying a stripped-down modern dance-rock sound unlike anything the group had ever produced before. The remaining group released a successful dance-rock style album, <i>90125</i>, under Horn's guidance, which sold well but also proved a dead-end, with no follow-up, when Horn chose not to remain with the group.</p><p>Yes was invisible for nearly two years after that, until the late 1987 release of <i>The Big Generator</i>, which performed only moderately well. Meanwhile, in 1986, Steve Howe reappeared as a member of the quintet GTR, whose self-titled album reached number 11 in America. The proliferation of ex-Yes members gathering together in various combinations led to an ongoing legal dispute over who owned the group name, which came to a head in 1989. Luckily for four of them, the name Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe was recognizable enough to reach the fans, which sent the resulting album into the U.S. Top 40 and the British Top 20, more or less handing them a victory by acclamation (later supported by the settlement) in their dispute over the name. By touring with ~An Evening of Yes Music,~ they presented their classic repertory to sell-out houses all over the country, including a 1990 gig at Madison Square Garden.</p><p>The legal squabbles had all been settled by the spring of 1991, at which time a composite ~mega Yes~ group consisting of Anderson, Howe, Wakeman, Squire, Kaye, White, Rabin, and Bruford (all of the key past members except Peter Banks) embarked on a blow-out world tour (which included the filming of a video historical documentary of the band, Yesyears: The Video) called Yesshows 1991. The accompanying album, <i>Union</i>, which displayed somewhat tougher sound than they'd been known for, debuted on the British charts at number seven and reached number 15 in America. This tour, which allowed the band to showcase music from all of its previous incarnations and, in the second half, featured each member who wished it in a solo spot, broke more records. These mammoth three-hour shows and the resulting publicity (even news organizations that normally didn't cover rock concerts did features on the reunion) only seemed to heighten interest in the four-CD boxed set <i>YesYears</i>, which was released by Atlantic in 1991.</p><p>By the mid-'90s, even longtime detractors of progressive rock, who loathed the band's early-'70s album-length musical excursions, conceded that Yes is the best of all the bands in their particular field of endeavor. The group continues to sell CDs in large quantity — in 1995, Atlantic Records issued upgraded, remastered versions of the group's classic 1960s and '70s albums — even as the work of many of their one-time rivals are consigned to the cut-out bins; and their periodic tours, as well as numerous solo albums (especially by Wakeman, Anderson, and Howe), are taken very seriously by fans and critics. Today, their music of almost every era is regarded by fans with undiminished enthusiasm, and by their critics as respectable attempts at doing something serious with rock music.</p>&mdash; <b>Bruce Eder</b>",

				"review": "<p>On Yes' first two albums, Yes (1969) and Time and a Word (1970), the quintet was mostly searching for a sound on which they could build, losing one of their original members -- guitarist Peter Banks -- in the process. Their third time out proved the charm -- The Yes Album constituted a de facto second debut, introducing the sound that would carry them forward across the next decade or more. Gone are any covers of outside material, the group now working off of its own music from the ground up. A lot of the new material was actually simpler -- in linear structure, at least -- than some of what had appeared on their previous albums, but the internal dynamics of their playing had also altered radically, and much of the empty space that had been present in their earlier recordings was also filled up here -- suddenly, between new member Steve Howe's odd mix of country- and folk-based progressive guitar and the suddenly liberated bass work and drumming of Chris Squire and Bill Bruford, respectively, the group's music became extremely busy. And lead singer Jon Anderson, supported by Squire and Howe, filled whatever was left almost to overflowing. Anderson's soaring falsetto and the accompanying harmonies, attached to haunting melodies drawn from folk tunes as often as rock, applied to words seemingly derived from science fiction, and all delivered with the bravura of an operatic performance -- by the band as well as the singer -- proved a compelling mix. What's more, despite the busy-ness of their new sound, the group wasn't afraid to prove that less could sometimes be more: three of the high points were the acoustic-driven ~Your Move~ and ~The Clap~ (a superb showcase for Howe on solo acoustic guitar), and the relatively low-key ~A Venture~ (oddly enough, the latter was the one cut here that didn't last in the group's repertory; most of the rest, despite the competition from their subsequent work, remained in their concert set for years to come). The Yes Album did what it had to do, outselling the group's first two long-players and making the group an established presence in America where, for the first time, they began getting regular exposure on FM radio. Sad to say, the only aspect of The Yes Album that didn't last much longer was Tony Kaye on keyboards: his Hammond organ holds its own in the group's newly energized sound, and is augmented by piano and other instruments when needed, but he resisted the idea of adding the Moog synthesizer, that hot instrument of the moment, to his repertory. The band was looking for a bolder sound than the Hammond could generate, and after some initial rehearsals of material that ended up on their next album, he was dropped from the lineup, to be replaced by Rick Wakeman.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Yes' second (and least successful) album was a transitional effort; the group trying for a more produced and sophisticated sound through the use of an orchestra. Even so, the results weren't conventional, because the group didn't tone down or turn down its sound. Much of Time and a Word relies on bold, highly animated performances by Bill Bruford, Chris Squire, and Tony Kaye. Additionally, by this time the group was developing a much tauter ensemble than was evident on their first LP, so there's no lack of visceral excitement. ~No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed~ was a bold opening, a highly amplified, frenzied adaptation of the Richie Havens song, melded with Jerome Moross' title music from the movie The Big Country. Somewhat more successful musically is ~Then,~ which keeps the orchestral accompaniment to a minimum and allows Kaye and Banks to stretch out on organ and guitar. ~Everydays~ is highlighted by Anderson's ethereal vocals and Kaye's dueting with the orchestra. A surprising amount of the material here seems rather tuneless, but the group was solidifying its sound and, in the process, forcing Banks out of the lineup, despite some beautiful moments for him (and Tony Kaye) on the prettiest parts of ~The Prophet,~ a piece that also contains fragments of music that anticipate Yes' work right up through Tales from Topographic Oceans. ~Astral Traveller,~ as a title, anticipates the themes of future group work, though they still don't have the dexterity to pull off the tempo changes they're trying for. By the time the record was completed, Banks was out of the band, which is why Steve Howe, his successor, ended up pictured on the cover of most editions.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

Ironically, the album was a patchwork job, hastily assembled in order to cover the cost of Wakeman's array of instruments. But the group built effectively on the groundwork left by <i>The Yes Album</i>, and the group had an AM-radio sucker-punch, aimed at all of those other progressive bands who eschewed the notion of hit singles, in the form of ~Roundabout,~ the edited version (sort of ~highlights~ of the album version) of which pulled in millions of young kids who'd never heard them before. The single clicked, most album-buyers liked the long version and all of the rest of what they found, and the band was made.

Their third time out proved the charm -- The Yes Album constituted a de facto second debut, introducing the sound that would carry them forward across the next decade or more. Gone are any covers of outside material, the group now working off of its own music from the ground up. A lot of the new material was actually simpler -- in linear structure, at least -- than some of what had appeared on their previous albums, but the internal dynamics of their playing had also altered radically, and much of the empty space that had been present in their earlier recordings was also filled up here -- suddenly, between new member Steve Howe's odd mix of country- and folk-based progressive guitar and the suddenly liberated bass work and drumming of Chris Squire and Bill Bruford, respectively, the group's music became extremely busy. And lead singer Jon Anderson, supported by Squire and Howe, filled whatever was left almost to overflowing. Anderson's soaring falsetto and the accompanying harmonies, attached to haunting melodies drawn from folk tunes as often as rock, applied to words seemingly derived from science fiction, and all delivered with the bravura of an operatic performance -- by the band as well as the singer -- proved a compelling mix. What's more, despite the busy-ness of their new sound, the group wasn't afraid to prove that less could sometimes be more: three of the high points were the acoustic-driven ~Your Move~ and ~The Clap~ (a superb showcase for Howe on solo acoustic guitar), and the relatively low-key ~A Venture~ (oddly enough, the latter was the one cut here that didn't last in the group's repertory; most of the rest, despite the competition from their subsequent work, remained in their concert set for years to come). The Yes Album did what it had to do, outselling the group's first two long-players and making the group an established presence in America where, for the first time, they began getting regular exposure on FM radio. Sad to say, the only aspect of The Yes Album that didn't last much longer was Tony Kaye on keyboards: his Hammond organ holds its own in the group's newly energized sound, and is augmented by piano and other instruments when needed, but he resisted the idea of adding the Moog synthesizer, that hot instrument of the moment, to his repertory. The band was looking for a bolder sound than the Hammond could generate, and after some initial rehearsals of material that ended up on their next album, he was dropped from the lineup, to be replaced by Rick Wakeman.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

Drummer Bill Bruford was already shifting restlessly against Jon Anderson's increasingly mystic/mystifying lyricism, while contemporary reports of the recording sessions depicted bandmate Rick Wakeman, too, as little more than an observer to the vast tapestry that Anderson, Steve Howe, and Chris Squire were creating. For it was vast. <i>Close to the Edge</i> comprised just three tracks, the epic ~And You and I~ and ~Siberian Khatru,~ plus a side-long title track that represented the musical, lyrical, and sonic culmination of all that Yes had worked toward over the past five years. <i>Close to the Edge</i> would make the Top Five on both sides of the Atlantic, dispatch Yes on the longest tour of its career so far and, if hindsight be the guide, launch the band on a downward swing that only disintegration, rebuilding, and a savage change of direction would cure. The latter, however, was still to come. In 1972, <i>Close to the Edge</i> was a flawless masterpiece.<p>&mdash; <b>Dave Thompson</b>"

Ironically, the album was a patchwork job, hastily assembled in order to cover the cost of Wakeman's array of instruments. But the group built effectively on the groundwork left by <i>The Yes Album</i>, and the group had an AM-radio sucker-punch, aimed at all of those other progressive bands who eschewed the notion of hit singles, in the form of ~Roundabout,~ the edited version (sort of ~highlights~ of the album version) of which pulled in millions of young kids who'd never heard them before. The single clicked, most album-buyers liked the long version and all of the rest of what they found, and the band was made.

				"review": "<p>We all know the classic Yes live album Yessongs inside out, and have been listening to it and loving it for nearly 40 years. Documenting the bands 1972 tour of Close to the Edge, it's a landmark live album and considered one of the best ever in the genre of progressive rock. Problem is, Yessongs always had somewhat of a muddy sound, a problem even the remastered edition didn't really rectify, but considering the time and conditions it was recorded under, there's not been a lot that can be done to clean it up. Fast forward now many years, and a box of reel-to-reel tapes have been found of 7 shows from the same tour, all recorded at concerts in North America virtually a few days apart in 1972, each with very strong audio quality made even better by using modern day 'clean up' and restoration techniques. There is a 14CD box set that includes all 7 full shows available for completists to have to hear every available concert, but this particular 2 disc version contains the best performances from those shows. The sound quality is amazing, crystal clear so you can hear every little nuance being played by Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman, Chris Squire, Jon Anderson, and Alan White, which is not something you could always say about Yessongs. In many ways, Progeny can now almost be looked at as the ultimate live Yes album from that era, except, and of course there's always an 'except', that a few tunes from Yessongs, namely ~Starship Trooper~, ~Long Distance Runaround~, and ~Perpetual Change~ are nowhere to be found here, nor on the larger box sets, so either they didn't play them on the US part of the tour or the decision was made to leave them off these collections.</p><p>That aside, what is on display here is magical, vintage Yes at the height of their powers. I won't go into the virtues of classic songs like ~And You and I~, ~Heart of the Sunrise~, ~Roundabout~, ~I've Seen All Good People~, ~Yours Is No Disgrace~, ~Close to the Edge~, and my personal favorite ~Siberian Khatru~, as we are all aware of just how great these tunes are, but the clarity of these recordings and the powerful performances are what makes them exceptional. The late Chris Squire looms tall with his thudding, muscular, and quite elastic Rickenbacker bass, as Howe's virtuoso guitar lines and Wakeman's majestic keyboards dazzle and dart around each other, but the real surprise here is just how clear & powerful White's drums sound. Remember, he was the brand new guy for this tour, and literally had to learn the entire set list in a matter of days, so his outstanding performances on these recordings is astounding. And, what more can you say about Howe & Wakeman, who get their little moments to shine solo on ~Clap/Mood For a Day~ and ~Excerpts From 'The Six Wives of Henry VIII~...these guys are just masters of their craft. The always solid Anderson just floats over the top of all these grandiose sounds, but he's especially wondrous on the always engaging ~And You and I~ and an aggressive take on ~Yours Is No Disgrace~.</p><p>Of course, a brand new, stunning Roger Dean work of art adorns the lovely digipack, and a booklet filled with information on these recordings and their history slots in nicely inside. Like I mentioned earlier, if you have to have the complete concerts (which would really give you something that rivals and even surpasses Yessongs) then go for the full-blown 14 disc box set. Many will probably be happy enough with this 'highlights' set, but I'll leave that up to you to decide.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Pete Pardo</strong></p><hr/><p>Cognoscenti may or may not agree this material constitutes Yes' holy grail as the group became ever-so-slightly more structured with the departure of original drummer Bill Bruford (to join King Crimson)and the subsequent enlistment of Alan White to fulfill that role. But the somewhat rigidified presentations of these shows belies how the vocal and instrumental expertise is catalyzed by the extraordinary self-discipline evident on ~I've Seen All Good People.~ </p><p>There's no denying the enthralling and uplifting sensation of the latter and that force is even greater later in the show during the greater complexity of ~Roundabout;~ the intricacy of Steve Howe's electric guitar as it interweaves with Rick Wakeman's keyboards and Chris Squire's bass mirror the shifting textures even more graphically, all the while maintaining, and even elevating the visceral impact of the musicianship. White's comparatively simpler approach to his kit actually keeps Yes from sound too busy for the own good. In contrast, while some of the lyrics of ~Siberian Khatru, ~ for instance, sound esoteric to a fault, the pastoral images can lend to the rapture Yes aims to create. </p><p>Still, workouts like ~Heart of the Sunrise~ (and even more Howe's solo ~Clap~/Mood for a Day~ and Wakeman's spotlight ~Excerpts from The Six Wives of Henry VIII~) lend themselves to the criticism of technical braggadocio, unless they're taken as pure sonic expression, but the latter the acoustic-based number adds markedly to the dynamic flow of the concert , particularly as it sets up ~And You and I~ where the deceptively frail sound of Jon Anderson's voice comes to the for as a major asset of the Yes sound even more so as part of the billowing group harmonies when Howe and Squire join in. </p><p>Co-producers Steve Woolard and Brian Kehew create a seamless progression of performances here from performances straddling North America including North Carolina, Nassau Long Island and Toronto Canada. In doing so the detailed clarity of the audio quality reveals ~ Opening~ (Excerpt from ~Firebird Suite~) less pretension that pragmatism given the tuning enacted in the background. </p><p>Further such nuance below the surface of the most prominent components of the arrangements is worthy of selective scrutiny here, all the more remarkable given the age of the recordings (notwithstanding Yes long-standing devotion to audio quality). The unadorned mix reveals the exertion expended by the group as they play, the antithesis of antiseptic, especially played at high-volume (headphone listening doesn't offer the same insight). ~Close to the Edge, ~ for instance, moves at a breathless pace. </p><p>A highly-distinctive 'greatest hits' set for the novice, Highlights From Seventy-Two is also available for nostalgists in the form of a of a three-LP set of vinyl, while for the completists, there's a fourteen-disc box titled Seven Shows From Seventy- Two comprising the fruits of this archiving project in their entirety. All these various configurations are but a further reflection of the multi-colored density of this music.</p><p>Track Listing: CD 1: Opening (Excerpt From “Firebird Suite”); Siberian Khatru. I’ve Seen All Good People. a. “Your Move b. “All Good People. Heart Of The Sunrise; Clap/Mood For A Day; And You And I: a. Cord Of Life b. Eclipse. c. The Preacher The Teacher. d. Apocalypse. CD 2: Close To The Edge: a. The Solid Time Of Change. b. Total Mass Retain. c. I Get Up I Get Down. d. Seasons Of Man; Excerpts From “The Six Wives Of Henry VIII; Roundabout; Yours Is No Disgrace.</p><p>Personnel: Jon Anderson: vocals, percussion; Steve Howe: guitar, vocals ; Chris Squire: bass, vocals; Rick Wakeman: keyboards; Alan White: drums</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Doug Collette</strong></p><hr/><p>If ever there were too much of a good thing, Progeny: Seven Shows from Seventy-Two by Yes is likely it. These seven complete shows on as many double-disc sets were recorded in Canada and the U.S. between October 31 and November 20 during the Close to the Edge tour. They are the ~source code~ tapes from which much of Yessongs was assembled. That said, these complete gigs are remixed and remastered from two-inch, 16-track recordings previously thought to be lost. (Yessongs was created from two-track mixdown masters -- each subsequent remaster has come from those tapes.) Drummer Alan White had been with the band just three months after taking over from Bill Bruford. Musically, however, he's claimed the chair by this point; his uncanny playing relationship with bassist Chris Squire is cemented. The sonic quality of these concerts and the considerable variation in improvisational and instrumental moments, banter, and sheer dynamic force from night to night -- remember, this set is for the hardest of the hardcore only; civilians and casual fans won't get it -- are well worth it.</p><p>Producer Brian Kehew's technical notes detail the painstaking process of getting the best sound possible and recapturing the dynamic range that Yessongs lacked. Some of the tricks included re-recording Squire's bass through a '70s-era bass amp and layering it atop the original thin one to get the fat, nasty, proper balance that is a Yes trademark. They also (re)calibrated the Dolby level of each guitar, individual drum, vocal, keyboard, etc. track setting by ear because they had been set incorrectly in the first place. That doesn't mean that the sound is perfect. Occasionally one can hear bits of ambient buzzing, a little too much crowd noise in a few places, moments of brightness -- as in the Duke University performance of Steve Howe's solo guitar break that makes a medley of ~Mood for a Day~ with ~Clap.~ But these are quibbles. For fans, this box is about representing the performance magic of Yes at an early peak. Jon Anderson is at full, soaring, angelic strength. Rick Wakeman's B-3 and synth playing are on point, his synths soaring and free of bloated excess. Howe, Squire, and White surprise audiences and one another nightly with their interplay and solos. Each of these shows does exactly that. Whether it's in the extended jams like ~Yours Is No Disgrace~ or the ~Close to the Edge~ and ~And You and I~ suites, or awe-inspiring renderings of ~Heart of the Sunrise~ and the driving hard rock prog of ~Roundabout,~ Yes were firing on all cylinders. Progeny is what rabid fans want; it captures not only the band at its early, inspired best but prog rock too. The new sleeve art by Roger Dean (each set has a different illustration) helps make this deluxe set a necessity for the obsessed.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

After all, how else but on a triple-LP collection could one hope to re-create (and/or contain) an adequate sampling of Yes' live presentation? Especially since their tunes typically clocked in in excess of ten minutes. Although they had turned in five studio long-players, the vast majority of Yessongs (1973) is drawn from their three most recent endeavors The Yes Album (1970), Fragile (1971), and Close to the Edge (1972). There are two exceptions, the first being the ~Opening (Excerpt from ~Firebird Suite~)~ -- which comes from the 1969 Boston Symphony Orchestra's recording, conducted by Seiji Ozawa. The other is Rick Wakeman's keyboard solo ~Excerpts from 'The Six Wives Of Henry VIII'.~ Yes had just undergone a personnel change shortly after concluding work on Close to the Edge as Bill Bruford (percussion) left to join King Crimson in July of 1972. Bruford can be heard on ~Perpetual Change,~ as well as the medley of ~Long Distance Runaround~ and ~The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus).~ Enthusiasts keen on various and arguably irrelevant minutia should note the spelling of ~praimaturus~ as credited on Yessongs. It is slightly different from Fragile, which is denoted as ~praematurus.~ That bit of trivia aside, the new lineup finds Alan White (drums), quite ably filling Bruford's shoes, alongside Jon Anderson (vocals), Steve Howe (guitars), Chris Squire (bass/vocals), and Rick Wakeman (keyboards).</p><p>One of their trademarks has always been an ability to re-create their often densely layered sound in concert. They effortlessly pull off the tricky chord progressions and changes in time signatures of ~Siberian Khatru~ and a sublime ~Heart of the Sunrise,~ which unquestionably bests the dexterity of its carefully crafted studio counterpart. Both Howe and Squire's respective solos during ~The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)~ are highlights as they give the entire unit an opportunity to show off their capacity for dramatic dynamics. The remainder of Yessongs is similarly strong, particularly the note-perfect ~Close to the Edge,~ and the inspired concluding instrumental jam during ~Starship Trooper.~ However, one criticism that can be leveled at the entire Yessongs release is the less than optimal audio quality throughout. The sound is generally muddy with no real fidelity to speak of and an even less precise stereoscape. But until someone goes back to the multi-tracks and remixes them for 21st century ears, this is as good as it gets when documenting Yes during this seminal transition period.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

Anything prior to The Yes Album is cut out, no attempt is made to salvage snippets from Relayer or Tales from Topographic Oceans; Drama and Tormato are dispensed with. What remains is what made this band great: the science fiction and fantasy-laced epics, the tangible wizardry of their arrangements, moments that crystallized the magical power of music, and two unreleased live tracks from 1978 that find the band tethered to the realm of mortals.~ The logic behind the live tracks is pretty simple: ~Roundabout~ and ~I've Seen All Good People~ are two tracks that missed the original LP cut, so live versions of them were included with the LP as a bonus 45 rpm single. This is only a minor complaint, though, and one easily overlooked in lieu of the music that made the first cut. Squire's picks are undoubtedly the right ones: ~Heart of the Sunrise~ to start things off, ~And You and I~ in all its ten-minute glory, ~Starship Trooper~ and ~Yours Is No Disgrace~ from their third album, and ~Long Distance Runaround~ and ~The Fish.~ Classic Yes remains the place to start if you're interested in the band or just want to hear their best music in one sitting.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Dave Connolly</strong></p>"

With Magnification, Yes has taken that a step further, adding a symphony orchestra. The orchestra is not simply thrown over the top, though; the songs were written for this particular grouping. Yes has flirted with this type of thing before. Released in 1969, the Time and a Word album featured a string section, but the complete integration is what makes Magnification a superior work. The material on the CD is pretty standard modern Yes fare, but the addition of that symphony really does create a whole new texture. It also seems as if it inspired the band, and some members put in performances that are head and shoulders above their recent work. The album does have its weak moments and gets just a little over the top at times, but there are a lot more moments that shine than dull ones.</p>&mdash; <b>Gary Hill</b>"

		"biography": "<p>Centred around the prolific songwriting skills of singer/guitarist Tim Rogers, pop group You Am I are one of the most successful and internationally admired Australian bands of the '90s. At home, they've scored three number one albums, Sonic Youth and Soundgarden are counted among their admirers, and Silverchair even named themselves after a You Am I song. Their influences combine the Who, Small Faces, Jam, Clash and The Replacements.</p><p>Rogers formed his first band while studying arts/law at the Australian National University in Canberra, before forming the first version of You Am I with his school friend Nick Tischler and Tim's older brother Jaimme in December 1989. (The band name came from a conversation at a gig with a spaced out fan sprouting ~You am I, I am you~ philosophies.) Jaimme left the band after a fight with brother Tim at the end of 1990. Nick left of his own accord because he didn't feel he could realize Tim's vision musically. Ultimately they were replaced by the group's one-time sound mixer Andy Kent (bass) and Russell Hopkinson (drums), creating the classic three piece rock line-up which has been the core of the band.</p><p>Their breakthrough came at the inaugural Lollapalooza style Big Day Out concert in January 1993. Lee Renaldo of Sonic Youth was impressed enough to produce their fourth EP <em>Coprolalia</em>, followed by eight days spent in Canon Falls, Minnesota where Renaldo helped produce the band's first album <em>Sound as Ever</em>. Steeped in stripped-back guitar-riff pop delivered in Tim Rogers' characteristic strained vocals, Sound as Ever won You Am I the 1993 Australian Recording Industry Association award for Best Alternative Release. (One of the album's singles, ~Berlin Chair,~ later provided Silverchair with half its name.) During the following  year's Big Day Out concert tour, You Am I captured the attention of Soundgarden who invited them to fill the support spot on the band's next American tour. You Am I took time off during September 1994 to record another album at Green Street Studios, New York. Full of concise pop songs, <em>Hi Fi Way</em> earned You Am I the first of its Australian number one albums, plus a handful of ARIA awards. The following '60s retro concept album Hourly Daily was recorded and produced locally in Sydney. In June 1998 You Am I released the return to basics album <em>#4 Record</em>.</p><p>Commercially successful in Australia, critically acclaimed around the world, Tim Rogers has pushed his talents beyond You Am I with solo performances, releasing a countryish introspective solo album <em>What Rhymes with Cars and Girls</em>, producing the soundtrack for the 1997 movie Idiot Box, and writing songs to order for various Australian recording artists. In July 1999 You Am I invited friends and fans to a warehouse in Melbourne and over two nights recorded the live album <em>...Saturday Night, 'Round Ten</em>. Concise and tuneful on record,  on stage You Am I are raw, brash and bratish. One gets the impression that the live album represents the closure of an era, bringing home all that You Am I have been on stage and on record since the release of Sound as Ever.</p>&mdash; <b>Ed.

		"biography": "<div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/ny-016.jpg~ alt=~After the Gold Rush~/><p>Few, if any, major artists in the rock pantheon have been as celebrated, as influential, and as thoroughly idiosyncratic as Neil Young. Since he left Buffalo Springfield to go out on his own in 1968, Young has famously followed his muse in unpredictable directions, rarely employing the same musical template for two albums in a row (and often presenting an entirely different musical statement by the time he gets around to touring behind a new LP). The constants in Young's catalog are few, but they're strong: the quality of his songwriting, which ranks with Bob Dylan for depth and emotional power; his commitment to spontaneous creation that values honesty and passion over technique; and the force of his guitar work, introspective in his acoustic work and roaring in his electric performances, especially with Crazy Horse. His two dominant styles have been gentle folk and country-rock (best typified by 1970's After the Gold Rush and 1972's Harvest), and crushingly loud electric guitar rock (1990's Ragged Glory and the second half of 1979's Rust Never Sleeps represent this facet at its peak). But he's just as likely to detour into jam-friendly rock (1969's Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere), ragged blues-rock (1975's Tonight's the Night), electronics (1982's Trans), rockabilly (1983's Everybody's Rockin'), straight-ahead country (1985's Old Ways), politically themed concept albums (2003's Greendale and 2006's Living with War), and lo-fi interpretive sessions of songs from the past (2012's Americana and 2014's A Letter Home). Despite his enormous catalog and influence, Young continues to move forward, writing new songs and exploring new music. His restless spirit has ensured that he's one of the few rock veterans as vital in his old age as he was in his youth, still making fresh sounds and challenging his audience more than 50 years into his career.</p><p>Born in Toronto, Canada, Neil Young moved to Winnipeg with his mother following her divorce from his sports journalist father. Young began playing music in high school. Not only did he play in garage rock outfits like the Squires, but he also played in local folk clubs and coffeehouses, where he eventually met Joni Mitchell and Stephen Stills. During the mid-'60s, he returned to Toronto, where he played as a solo folk act. By 1966, he joined the Mynah Birds, which also featured bassist Bruce Palmer and Rick James. The group recorded an album's worth of material for Motown, none of which was released at the time. Frustrated by his lack of success, Young moved to Los Angeles in his Pontiac hearse, taking Palmer along as support. Shortly after they arrived in L.A., they happened to meet Stills, and they formed Buffalo Springfield, who quickly became one of the leaders of the California folk-rock scene.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/ny-007.jpg~ alt=~Déjà Vu~/><p>Despite the success of Buffalo Springfield, the group was plagued with tension, and Young quit the band several times before finally leaving to become a solo artist in May of 1968. Hiring Elliot Roberts as his manager, Young signed with Reprise Records and released his eponymous debut album in early 1969. By the time the album was released, he had begun playing with a local band called the Rockets, which featured guitarist Danny Whitten, bassist Billy Talbot, and drummer Ralph Molina. Young renamed the group Crazy Horse and had them support him on his second album, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, which was recorded in just two weeks. Featuring such Young staples as ~Cinnamon Girl~ and ~Down by the River,~ the album went gold. Following the completion of the record, he began jamming with Crosby, Stills & Nash, eventually joining the group for their spring 1970 album Déjà Vu. Although he was now part of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, he continued to record as a solo artist, releasing After the Gold Rush in August 1970. The album, along with its accompanying single ~Only Love Can Break Your Heart,~ established Young as a solo star, and fame only increased through his association with CSN&Y.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/ny-006.jpg~ alt=~4 Way Street~/><p>Although Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young were a very successful act, they were also volatile, and they had split by the spring 1971 release of the live Four Way Street. The following year, Young had his first number one album with the mellow country-rock of Harvest, which also featured his first (and only) number one single, ~Heart of Gold.~ Instead of embracing his success, he spurned it, following it with the noisy, bleak live film Journey Through the Past. Both the movie and its soundtrack received terrible reviews, as did the live Time Fades Away, an album recorded with the Stray Gators that was released in 1973.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/ny-018.jpg~ alt=~On the Beach~/><p>Both Journey Through the Past and Time Fades Away signaled that Young was entering a dark period in his life, but they only scratched the surface of his anguish. Inspired by the overdose deaths of Danny Whitten in 1972 and his roadie Bruce Berry the following year, Young wrote and recorded the bleak, druggy Tonight's the Night late in 1973, but declined to release it at the time. Instead, he released On the Beach, which was nearly as harrowing, in 1974; Tonight's the Night finally appeared in the spring of 1975. By the time of its release, Young had recovered, as indicated by the record's hard-rocking follow-up, Zuma, an album recorded with Crazy Horse and released later that year.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/ny-019.jpg~ alt=~Long May You Run~/><p>Young's focus began to wander in 1976, as he recorded the duet album Long May You Run with Stephen Stills and then abandoned his partner midway through the supporting tour. The following year, he recorded the country-rock-oriented American Stars 'n Bars, which featured vocals by Nicolette Larson, who was also prominent on 1978's Comes a Time. Prior to the release of Comes a Time, Young scrapped the country-rock album Homegrown and assembled the triple-album retrospective Decade. At the end of 1978, he embarked on an arena tour called Rust Never Sleeps, which was designed as a showcase for new songs. Half of the concert featured Young solo, the other half featured him with Crazy Horse. That was the pattern that Rust Never Sleeps, released in the summer of 1979, followed. The record was hailed as a comeback, proving that Young was one of the few rock veterans who attacked punk rock head-on. That fall he released the double album Live Rust and the live movie Rust Never Sleeps.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/ny-003.jpg~ alt=~Hawks & Doves~/><p>Rust Never Sleeps restored Young to his past glory, but he perversely decided to trash his goodwill in 1980 with Hawks & Doves, a collection of acoustic songs that bore the influence of conservative right-wing politics. In 1981, Young released the heavy rock album Re*ac*tor, which received poor reviews. Following its release, he left Reprise for the fledgling Geffen Records, where he was promised lots of money and artistic freedom. Young decided to push his Geffen contract to the limit, releasing the electronic Trans in December 1982, where his voice was recorded through a computerized vocoder. The album and its accompanying technology-dependent tour were received with bewildered, negative reviews. The rockabilly of Everybody's Rockin' (1983) was equally scorned, and Young soon settled into a cult audience for the mid-'80s.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/ny-008.jpg~ alt=~Landing on Water~/><p>Over the course of the decade, Young released three albums that were all stylistic exercises. In 1985, he released the straight country Old Ways, which was followed by the new wave-tinged Landing on Water the following year. He returned to Crazy Horse for 1987's Life, but by that time, he and Geffen had grown sick of each other, and he returned to Reprise in 1988. His first album for Reprise was the bluesy, horn-driven This Note's for You, which was supported by an acclaimed video that satirized rock stars endorsing commercial products. At the end of the year, he recorded a reunion album with Crosby, Stills & Nash called American Dream, which was greeted with savagely negative reviews.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/ny-020.jpg~ alt=~Freedom~/><p>American Dream didn't prepare any observer for the critical and commercial success of 1989's Freedom, which found Young following the half-acoustic/half-electric blueprint of Rust Never Sleeps to fine results. Around the time of its release, Young became a hip name to drop in indie rock circles, and he was the subject of a tribute record titled The Bridge in 1989. The following year, Young reunited with Crazy Horse for Ragged Glory, a loud, feedback-drenched album that received his strongest reviews since the '70s. For the supporting tour, Young hired the avant-rock band Sonic Youth as his opening group, providing them with needed exposure while earning him hip credibility within alternative rock scenes. On the advice of Sonic Youth, Young added the noise collage EP Arc as a bonus to his 1991 live album, Weld.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/ny-013.jpg~ alt=~Harvest Moon~/><p>Weld and the Sonic Youth tour helped position Neil Young as an alternative and grunge rock forefather, but he decided to abandon loud music for its 1992 follow-up, Harvest Moon. An explicit sequel to his 1972 breakthrough, Harvest Moon became Young's biggest hit in years, and he supported the record with an appearance on MTV Unplugged, which was released the following year as an album. Also in 1993, Geffen released the rarities collection Lucky Thirteen. The following year, he released Sleeps with Angels, which was hailed as a masterpiece in some quarters. Following its release, Young began jamming with Pearl Jam, eventually recording an album with the Seattle band in early 1995. The resulting record, Mirror Ball, was released to positive reviews in the summer of 1995, but it wasn't the commercial blockbuster it was expected to be; due to legal reasons, Pearl Jam's name was not allowed to be featured on the cover.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/ny-014.jpg~ alt=~Broken Arrow~/><p>In the summer of 1996, he reunited with Crazy Horse for Broken Arrow and supported it with a brief tour. That tour was documented in Jim Jarmusch's 1997 film Year of the Horse, which was accompanied by a double-disc live album. In 1999, Young reunited with Crosby, Stills & Nash for the first time in a decade, supporting their Looking Forward LP with the supergroup's first tour in a quarter century. A new solo effort, Silver & Gold, followed in the spring of 2000. In recognition of his 2000 summer tour, Young released the live album Road Rock, Vol. 1 the following fall, showcasing a two-night account of Young's performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, Colorado, in September 2000. A DVD version titled Red Rocks Live was issued that December, and included 12 tracks initially unavailable on Road Rock, Vol. 1. His next studio project was his most ambitious yet, a concept album about small-town life titled Greendale that he also mounted as a live dramatic tour and indie film.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/ny-014.jpg~ alt=~Prairie Wind~/><p>In early 2005, Young was diagnosed with a potentially deadly brain aneurysm. Undergoing treatment didn't slow him down, however, as he continued to write and record his next project. The acoustically based Prairie Wind appeared in the fall, with the concert film Heart of Gold, based around the album and directed by Jonathan Demme, released in 2006. That year also saw the release of the controversial Living with War, a collection of protest songs against the war in Iraq that featured titles such as ~Let's Impeach the President,~ ~Shock and Awe,~ and ~Lookin' for a Leader.~ Restless, prolific, and increasingly self-referential, Young issued Chrome Dreams II late in 2007 and the car-themed Fork in the Road in 2009. Later in 2009, Young finally issued the first installment in his long-rumored Archives series, Archives, Vol. 1, a massive first volume that combined over ten CD and DVD discs in a single box. As he was prepping Archives, Vol. 2, Young entered the studio with producer Daniel Lanois and recorded Le Noise, which appeared in the fall of 2010.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/ny-021.jpg~ alt=~A Treasure~/><p>Archives, Vol. 2 was not forthcoming, however, as Young stayed very active during the early 2010s. He finally reunited with Richie Furay and Stephen Stills as Buffalo Springfield for a pair of shows at his annual Bridge School Benefit in the fall of 2010. It wasn't a complete reunion, since bassist Bruce Palmer had died in 2004 and drummer Dewey Martin passed in 2009, but the three singers used drummer Joe Vitale and bassist Rick Rosas to fill in. The same configuration played six concerts in the spring of 2011 but reportedly did no studio work. Young continued going through his archives with the release of A Treasure in 2011, a single-disc set of live tracks recorded during his 1984-1985 tour with the International Harvesters that featured five previously unreleased Young songs mixed in with older songs like ~Flying on the Ground Is Wrong~ and ~Are You Ready for the Country?,~ all done in the classic Harvest style. In 2012, Young reunited with Crazy Horse for Americana, a set of classic folk tunes like ~This Land Is Your Land~ and ~Wayfarin' Stranger,~ followed several months later by the double-disc album of originals Psychedelic Pill, which again saw Young turning to the guitar garage stomp of Crazy Horse.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/ny-023.jpg~ alt=~Storytone~/><p>In September 2012, Young published his memoir, Waging Heavy Peace: A Hippie Dream. In the book, he wrote at length about his family and career, and also expressed his frustration with the low sound quality of digital music. Timed with the release of the book, Young announced the founding of Pono Music, originally a new audio format but later simplified to a music player and downloading service designed for audiophiles and listeners who had similar issues with sound quality. A Kickstarter campaign in 2014 raised $6 million, one of the largest digitally crowdfunded efforts in history, and the company started shipping the devices in the fall of 2014. On the recording front, Young entered Jack White's Third Man studios in Nashville to cut A Letter Home, a covers album featuring songs from Young's favorite songwriters. Within a few months, he announced another full-length for 2014, Storytone. The album was heralded with the release of an environmentally conscious song, ~Who's Going to Stand Up?,~ that Young had been performing in concert.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/ny-mon.jpg~ alt=~The Monsanto Years~/><p>Young's passion for environmental causes also informed his next album, 2015's The Monsanto Years, in which he took on the issues of genetically modified crops and agribusiness; the album found him backed by Promise of the Real, a band led by Lukas Nelson, son of outlaw country icon and Young's close friend Willie Nelson. Young and Promise of the Real supported The Monsanto Years with a tour, which became the basis for the 2016 live double album Earth. Just after the June release of Earth, Young wrote and recorded the protest album Peace Trail, which appeared in December 2016.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/ny-009.jpg~ alt=~The Visitor~/><p>Young continued his burst of activity in 2017 with the release of ~Children of Destiny.~ It was the first single from The Visitor, an album recorded with Promise of the Real that appeared in December 2017. The Promise of the Real also supported Young on Paradox, the soundtrack to the Daryl Hannah film starring Young and the band. Also in 2018, Young released two volumes in his Archives series: April saw the release of Roxy: Tonight's the Night Live, which was recorded in 1973, and November brought the release of Songs for Judy, a collection of highlights from his acoustic 1976 tour. Young unveiled another archival release in June 2019, Tuscaloosa, a live set recorded at an Alabama date on the same 1973 tour that produced Time Fades Away.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>",

Like its two predecessors in the Archives series, the concerts captured on Sugar Mountain are legendary among Neil Young collectors, in this case because of the gentle, tentative version of the title track that showed up on Decade -- prior to this, the only official release from the concert. At first glance, Sugar Mountain might seem similar to Live at Massey Hall 1971, as they're both solo acoustic sets, but the tenor of the two shows is quite different. Massey Hall captured Neil in full flight, just before the release of Harvest, whereas the concerts on Sugar Mountain were just a month or two shy of the release of his first solo album. He had hits with Buffalo Springfield -- much of the set list leans heavily on Springfield songs, such as ~Mr. Soul,~ ~Expecting to Fly,~ ~Birds,~ ~Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing,~ and ~Broken Arrow~ -- but he had yet to prove himself as a solo artist, so the endearing tentative quality of his performances shouldn't come as a surprise, and yet it does: Young's reputation as a steely renegade often suggests that he never second-guesses his moves. Neil doesn't second-guess here but he is fragile and human, telling stories (sometimes at considerable length) before sliding into these delicate songs, wryly lamenting that he should have some happy songs to sing before testing out the melody for ~Winterlong,~ stopping short because the song isn't quite written yet. It's a marvelously intimate performance, unguarded and open-hearted, unique in its delicate touch: it's Neil Young before the myth crystallized, and listening to it anew, it's easy to fall in love with him all over again.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

His two compositions on the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album Déjà Vu, ~Helpless~ and ~Country Girl,~ returned him to the folk and country styles he had pursued before delving into the hard rock of Everybody Knows; two other singles, ~Sugar Mountain~ and ~Oh, Lonesome Me,~ also emphasized those roots. But ~Ohio,~ a CSNY single, rocked as hard as anything on the second album. After the Gold Rush was recorded with the aid of Nils Lofgren, a 17-year-old unknown whose piano was a major instrument, turning one of the few real rockers, ~Southern Man~ (which had unsparing protest lyrics typical of Phil Ochs), into a more stately effort than anything on the previous album and giving a classic tone to the title track, a mystical ballad that featured some of Young's most imaginative lyrics and became one of his most memorable songs. But much of After the Gold Rush consisted of country-folk love songs, which consolidated the audience Young had earned through his tours and recordings with CSNY; its dark yet hopeful tone matched the tenor of the times in 1970, making it one of the definitive singer/songwriter albums, and it has remained among Young's major achievements.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Ever since he started rumbling about releasing his archives some 20, 30 years ago -- it's been so long, it's hard to keep track of the specifics -- Neil Young talked about it as a mammoth box set, or perhaps a series of box sets each chronicling a different era in his career, comprised entirely of unreleased recordings, some live, some studio. It was an eagerly anticipated set, since everybody knew that he had scores of unreleased recordings in his vaults. Not just songs, but full albums that were scrapped at the last minute. He regularly tested out new songs on tour, sometimes rewriting them later, sometimes never releasing them on album. Some of his peers had similar habits -- Bob Dylan had a similar treasure trove of unreleased recordings -- but unlike Dylan, Young took an active interest in archiving this material himself. Given the amount of unreleased tapes, some patience was in order, but as the years stretched into decades, with Neil tinkering away, changing his mind, waiting for digital sound to get out of the dark ages, it was easy to wonder if the set would ever come out. When it did, it was not with a splash, as was the official Bob Dylan Bootleg Series, which was inaugurated as a triple-disc box in 1991. No, Young eased his way into the series by releasing a single disc called Live at the Fillmore East late in 2006.</p><p>Billed as the second volume of the ~Performance Series~ -- clearly, the numbers are assigned chronologically in order of recording, not release -- Live at the Fillmore East is not dissimilar to the subsequent entries in Dylan's bootleg series: it focuses on a specific, significant tour in Young's past. In this case, it's Neil's 1970 tour with Crazy Horse, supporting Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, his first record with the band. This was the original lineup of Crazy Horse featuring Danny Whitten, who would die tragically of a heroin overdose a mere two years later, making this a pivotal tour in Young's history. Whitten's ghost haunted Young & Crazy Horse throughout the '70s, particularly on his gloomy masterpiece Tonight's the Night, which featured a version of Whitten's great ~Come on Baby Let's Go Downtown~ recorded during the group's stint at the Fillmore East in March 1970, which this album documents in a fuller fashion. That version of ~Downtown~ on Tonight's the Night hints at the power of this performance: simultaneously lithe and lumbering, it captures how Neil & Crazy Horse could sound at once unpredictable and inevitable. Part of that came from bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina, whose ramshackle rhythms were uniquely suited for Young, and pianist Jack Nitzsche also added texture to this tour, but this performance reveals how empathetic the interplay between Young and Whitten was. These guitarists weren't rivals; they interlocked and rode Talbot and Molina's steady, if occasionally misshapen, groove for as long as they could go -- and in the case of the 12-minute ~Down by the River~ and the 16-minute ~Cowgirl in the Sand,~ it was very long indeed, but they're never boring; they're hypnotic in their circular riffs and solos. Add to that a ragged, beautiful ~Winterlong~ and the sweet, loping ~Wonderin'~ -- performed here, but not released until Young revived and revamped it for his 1983 rockabilly record Everybody's Rockin' -- and this is truly a special performance and more than worthy beginning to the archives project.</p><p>That doesn't mean that this release is faultless. The main complaint that can be lodged against Live at the Fillmore East is that it's not a complete representation of a 1970 show. During this tour, Neil opened with an acoustic set and then had Crazy Horse come out for an electric set; the acoustic is not here, but most of the electric is, with only ~Cinnamon Girl~ absent -- and it's absent because there was not existing high-quality tape for it, unlike the rest of music that's featured here. So, it comes down to a matter of taste: for hardcore fans used to bootleg quality, they may lament the lack of a full show, but for those who want the best of this legendary stay at the Fillmore East in the best possible audio quality (including a DVD of the show, where the main program plays to photos of the band from the tour), that's what this set gives you. And in doing so, it gives a good indication that as Neil slowly rolls out the archives, he'll emphasize quality over completeness for better and for worse.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Where the first volume captured a portion of Neil's past that wasn't particularly well documented on record -- namely, the rampaging original Crazy Horse lineup in its 1970 prime -- this second installment may seem to cover familiar ground, at least to the outside observer who may assume that any solo acoustic Young must sound the same. That, of course, is not the case with an artist as mercurial and willful as Young, who was inarguably on a roll in 1971, coming off successes with Crazy Horse, Crosby, Stills & Nash, and his second solo record, 1970's After the Gold Rush. The concert chronicled on Live at Massey Hall finds Neil dipping into these recent successes for material, as he also airs material that would shortly find a home on 1972's Harvest in addition to playing songs that wouldn't surface until later in the decade -- ~Journey Through the Past~ and ~Love in Mind~ wound up on 1973's Time Fades Away, ~See the Sky About to Rain~ showed up on 1974's On the Beach -- and then there's two songs that never showed up on an official Neil Young album: the stomping hoedown ~Dance Dance Dance,~ which he gave to Crazy Horse, and ~Bad Fog of Loneliness,~ which gets its first release here. This is a remarkably rich set of songs, touching on nearly every aspect of Young's personality, whether it's his sweetness, his sensitivity, his loneliness, or even his often-neglected sense of fun. True, the latter only appears on ~Dance Dance Dance,~ but that comes as a welcome contrast to the stark sadness of ~See the Sky About to Rain.~ But even if ~Down by the River~ and ~Cowgirl in the Sand~ retain their intense sense of menace when stripped of the winding guitar workouts of Crazy Horse, this concert isn't dominated by melancholy: it's a warm, giving affair, built upon lovely readings of ~Helpless,~ ~Tell Me Why,~ ~Old Man,~ and an early incarnation of ~A Man Needs a Maid~ (here played as a medley with ~Heart of Gold~) that removes the bombast of the Harvest arrangement, revealing the fragile, sweet song that lies underneath. While this concert isn't as freewheeling and rich as Young's studio albums of the early '70s -- each record had a distinctive character different from its predecessor, thanks in part to producer David Briggs, arranger/pianist Jack Nitzsche, and Young's supporting musicians, including Crazy Horse or the Stray Gators -- it nevertheless captures the essence of Neil Young the singer and songwriter at his artistic peak. That's the reason why this concert has been a legendary bootleg for nearly four decades and why its release 36 years after its recording is so special: it may not add an additional narrative to Neil Young's history, but it adds detail, color, and texture to a familiar chapter of his career, rendering it fresh once more. No wonder Briggs wanted to release this concert as an album between After the Gold Rush and Harvest: it not only holds its own against those classics, it enhances them. [Live at Massey Hall was also released as a two-disc set that contained a CD of the show and a DVD containing the same concert in high fidelity audio.]</p><p>&mdash;<stong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Neil Young's most popular album, Harvest benefited from the delay in its release (it took 18 months to complete due to Young's back injury), which whetted his audience's appetite, the disintegration of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (Young's three erstwhile partners sang on the album, along with Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor), and most of all, a hit single. ~Heart of Gold,~ released a month before Harvest, was already in the Top 40 when the LP hit the stores, and it soon topped the charts. It's fair to say, too, that Young simply was all-pervasive by this time: ~Heart of Gold~ was succeeded at number one by ~A Horse with No Name~ by America, which was a Young soundalike record. But successful as Harvest was (and it was the best-selling album of 1972), it has suffered critically from reviewers who see it as an uneven album on which Young repeats himself. Certainly, Harvest employs a number of jarringly different styles. Much of it is country-tinged, with Young backed by a new group dubbed the Stray Gators who prominently feature steel guitarist Ben Keith, though there is also an acoustic track, a couple of electric guitar-drenched rock performances, and two songs on which Young is accompanied by the London Symphony Orchestra. But the album does have an overall mood and an overall lyric content, and they conflict with each other: The mood is melancholic, but the songs mostly describe the longing for and fulfillment of new love. Young is perhaps most explicit about this on the controversial ~A Man Needs a Maid,~ which is often condemned as sexist by people judging it on the basis of its title. In fact, the song contrasts the fears of committing to a relationship with simply living alone and hiring help, and it contains some of Young's most autobiographical writing. Unfortunately, like ~There's a World,~ the song is engulfed in a portentous orchestration. Over and over, Young sings of the need for love in such songs as ~Out on the Weekend,~ ~Heart of Gold,~ and ~Old Man~ (a Top 40 hit), and the songs are unusually melodic and accessible. The rock numbers, ~Are You Ready for the Country~ and ~Alabama,~ are in Young's familiar style and unremarkable, and ~There's a World~ and ~Words (Between the Lines of Age)~ are the most ponderous and overdone Young songs since ~The Last Trip to Tulsa.~ But the love songs and the harrowing portrait of a friend's descent into heroin addiction, ~The Needle and the Damage Done,~ remain among Young's most affecting and memorable songs.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Anyone who has followed Neil Young's career knows enough not to expect a simple evening of mellow good times when they see him in concert, but in 1973, when Young hit the road after Harvest had confirmed his status as a first-echelon rock star, that knowledge wasn't nearly as common as it is today. Young's natural inclinations to travel against the current of audience expectations were amplified by a stormy relationship between himself and his touring band, as well as the devastating death of guitarist Danny Whitten, who died of a drug overdose shortly after being given his pink slip during the first phase of tour rehearsals. The shows that followed turned into a nightly exorcism of Young's rage and guilt, as well as a battle between himself and an audience who, expecting to hear ~Old Man~ and ~Heart of Gold,~ didn't know what to make of the electric assault they witnessed. All the more remarkably, Young brought along a mobile recording truck to capture the tour on tape for a live album and the result, Time Fades Away, was a ragged musical parade of bad karma and road craziness, opening with Young bellowing ~14 junkies, too weak to work~ on the title cut, and closing with ~Last Dance,~ in which he tells his fans ~you can live your own life~ with all the optimism of a man on the deck of a sinking ship. While critics and fans were not kind to Time Fades Away upon first release, decades later it sounds very much of a piece with Tonight's the Night and On the Beach, albums that explored the troubled zeitgeist of America in the mid-'70s in a way few rockers had the courage to face. If the performances are often loose and ragged, they're also brimming with emotional force, and despite the dashed hopes of ~Yonder Stands the Sinner~ and ~Last Dance,~ ~Don't Be Denied~ is a moving remembrance of Young's childhood and what music has meant to him, and it's one of the most powerful performances Young ever committed to vinyl. Few rockers have been as willing as Young to lay themselves bare before their audience, and Time Fades Away ranks with the bravest and most painfully honest albums of his career -- like the tequila Young was drinking on that tour, it isn't for everyone, but you may be surprised by its powerful effects.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Written and recorded in 1973 shortly after the death of roadie Bruce Berry, Neil Young's second close associate to die of a heroin overdose in six months (the first was Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten), Tonight's the Night was Young's musical expression of grief, combined with his rejection of the stardom he had achieved in the late '60s and early '70s. The title track, performed twice, was a direct narrative about Berry: ~Bruce Berry was a working man/He used to load that Econoline van.~ Whitten was heard singing ~Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown,~ a live track recorded years earlier. Elsewhere, Young frequently referred to drug use and used phrases that might have described his friends, such as the chorus of ~Tired Eyes,~ ~He tried to do his best, but he could not.~ Performing with the remains of Crazy Horse, bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina, along with Nils Lofgren (guitar and piano) and Ben Keith (steel guitar), Young performed in the ragged manner familiar from Time Fades Away -- his voice was often hoarse and he strained to reach high notes, while the playing was loose, with mistakes and shifting tempos. But the style worked perfectly for the material, emphasizing the emotional tone of Young's mourning and contrasting with the polished sound of CSNY and Harvest that Young also disparaged. He remained unimpressed with his commercial success, noting in ~World on a String,~ ~The world on a string/Doesn't mean anything.~ In ~Roll Another Number,~ he said he was ~a million miles away/From that helicopter day~ when he and CSN had played Woodstock. And in ~Albuquerque,~ he said he had been ~starvin' to be alone/Independent from the scene that I've known~ and spoke of his desire to ~find somewhere where they don't care who I am.~ Songs like ~Speakin' Out~ and ~New Mama~ seemed to find some hope in family life, but Tonight's the Night did not offer solutions to the personal and professional problems it posed. It was the work of a man trying to turn his torment into art and doing so unflinchingly. Depending on which story you believe, Reprise Records rejected it or Young withdrew it from its scheduled release at the start of 1974 after touring with the material in the U.S. and Europe. In 1975, after a massive CSNY tour, Young at the last minute dumped a newly recorded album and finally put Tonight's the Night out instead. Though it did not become one of his bigger commercial successes, the album immediately was recognized as a unique masterpiece by critics, and it has continued to be ranked as one of the greatest rock & roll albums ever made.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

The album's saving grace was ~Like a Hurricane,~ one of Young's classic hard rock songs and guitar workouts, and a perennial concert favorite.

Live Rust was the soundtrack to Young's concert film Rust Never Sleeps (he had wanted to give it that title, but Reprise vetoed the idea, fearing confusion with the earlier album), and likewise was recorded October 22, 1978, at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. But much of the Rust Never Sleeps album had been recorded on the same tour, and Live Rust repeated four songs from that disc; besides, since Young had released the career retrospective Decade in 1977, critics felt he was unfairly recycling his older material and repeating his new material. In retrospect, however, Live Rust, now a single 74-minute CD, comes off as an excellent Neil Young live album and career summary, starting with the early song ~Sugar Mountain~ and running through then-new songs like ~My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)~ and ~Powderfinger.~ Young is effective in both his acoustic folksinger and hard-rocking Crazy Horse bandleader modes. The various distractions of the concert itself and the film, such as the pretentious props and cowled roadies, are absent, and what's left is a terrific Neil Young concert recording.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

His strongest collection since Tonight's the Night, its obvious antecedent was Bob Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home, and, as Dylan did, Young divided his record into acoustic and electric sides while filling his songs with wildly imaginative imagery. The leadoff track, ~My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)~ (repeated in an electric version at album's end as ~Hey Hey, My My [Into the Black]~ with slightly altered lyrics), is the most concise and knowing description of the entertainment industry ever written; it was followed by ~Thrasher,~ which describes Young's parallel artistic quest in an extended metaphor that also reflected the album's overall theme -- the inevitability of deterioration and the challenge of overcoming it. Young then spent the rest of the album demonstrating that his chief weapons against rusting were his imagination and his daring, creating an archetypal album that encapsulated his many styles on a single disc with great songs -- in particular the remarkable ~Powderfinger~ -- unlike any he had written before.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

The group plays fiercely, as usual, but the lyrics are sketchy, seemingly improvised (the nadir is the nine-minute ~T-Bone,~ which consists of the lines ~Got mashed potato/Ain't got no t-bone~ repeated over and over), and frequently cranky, as in ~Motor City,~ which finds Young criticizing Japanese cars, and ~Rapid Transit,~ which takes a belated swipe at new wave music while sounding like second-rate Talking Heads. For the second album in a row, Young seems to be just fulfilling his one-album-a-year record contract. The exception is the album-closing ~Shots~ (written by 1978), a more substantive and threatening song given a riveting performance. Later, it would be revealed that Young was finding time for his music while giving most of his attention to caring for his disabled son. Still, he might have been better advised to have suspended record-making for a few years instead of turning out half-baked efforts like this one.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

By the time a settlement had been reached, Young had been on the road with a country band called the International Harvesters for over a year and recorded a revamped version of Old Ways, a 1982 recording originally rejected by Geffen that was cut in the style of Harvest and Comes a Time, but with a stronger country leaning. Young depends heavily on friends, especially for vocals -- Waylon Jennings sings harmony on six out of the ten tracks, and one of the others is a duet with Willie Nelson. Though populated by cowboys and country references, Young's take on the genre is typically idiosyncratic, including a reworked version of his autobiography in ~Get Back to the Country,~ a cover of the 1956 Gogi Grant hit ~The Wayward Wind,~ and the uncategorizable ~Misfits,~ which portrays astronauts watching Muhammad Ali fights on television in space. Old Ways is not a great Neil Young album and at the time of its release served to alienate him even further from his audience, but it has its moments.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

In the fall 1986, he did the same thing, but Life, Young's first album with Crazy Horse since 1981's Re-ac-tor, was not one of his best albums. It was, however, better than most of the other albums he had made in the 1980s, and it was the first really interesting album he'd made in a long time. Despite the return to Crazy Horse, Young continued to use some of the production techniques from Landing on Water, especially the loud drums and the synthesizers. But he mixed things up, including acoustic-based songs such as ~Long Walk Home~ (which recalled ~After the Gold Rush~) and ~Inca Queen~ (the third in his series of long, atmospheric songs about the Incas) and rockers like ~Prisoners of Rock 'n' Roll.~ The last, with its attacks on ~record company clowns~ and chorus ~that's why we don't want to be good,~ seemed intended as the theme song for the Rusted-Out Garage Tour on which it was performed and served as a reminder that Young was still at odds with Geffen Records, which he left after releasing this album. Despite the criticism he had endured for his support of President Reagan's military buildup, Young had foreign policy on his mind in the action-movie-in-song ~Mideast Vacation~ and in ~Long Walk Home,~ which addressed military misadventures from Vietnam to Beirut. It could be argued that Young was repeating himself on much of this material and that the album was typically uneven. But Life was an encouraging step back to the tried and true for an exploratory artist who finally seemed to have realized that he had experimented too much for his own good.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Neil Young is famous for scrapping completed albums and substituting hastily recorded ones in radically different styles. Freedom, which was a major critical and commercial comeback after a decade that had confused reviewers and fans, seemed to be a selection of the best tracks from several different unissued Young projects. First and foremost was a hard rock album like the material heard on Young's recent EP, Eldorado (released only in the Far East), several of whose tracks were repeated on Freedom. On these songs -- especially ~Don't Cry,~ which sounded like a song about divorce, and a cover of the old Drifters hit ~On Broadway~ that he concluded by raving about crack -- Young played distorted electric guitar over a rhythm section in an even more raucous fashion than that heard on his Crazy Horse records. Second was a follow-up to Young's previous album, This Note's for You, which had featured a six-piece horn section. They were back on ~Crime in the City~ and ~Someday,~ though these lengthy songs, each of which contained a series of seemingly unrelated, mood-setting verses, were more reminiscent of songs like Bob Dylan's ~All Along the Watchtower~ than of the soul standards that inspired the earlier album. Third, there were tracks that harked back to acoustic-based, country-tinged albums like Harvest and Comes a Time, including ~Hangin' on a Limb~ and ~The Ways of Love,~ two songs on which Young dueted with Linda Ronstadt. There was even a trunk (or, more precisely, a drunk) song, ~Too Far Gone,~ which dated from Young's inebriated Stars 'n Bars period in the '70s. While one might argue that this variety meant few Young fans would be completely pleased with the album, what made it all work was that Young had once again written a great bunch of songs. The romantic numbers were carefully and sincerely written. The long imagistic songs were evocative without being obvious. And bookending the album were acoustic and electric versions of one of Young's great anthems, ~Rockin' in the Free World,~ a song that went a long way toward restoring his political reputation (which had been badly damaged when he praised President Reagan's foreign policy) by taking on hopelessness with a sense of moral outrage and explicitly condemning President Bush's domestic policy. Freedom was the album Neil Young fans knew he was capable of making, but feared he would never make again.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

The album's dominant sound was made by Young's noisy guitar, which bordered on and sometimes slipped over into distortion, while Crazy Horse kept up the songs' bright tempos. Despite the volume, the tunes were catchy, with strong melodies and good choruses, and they were given over to love, humor, and warm reminiscence. They were also platforms for often extended guitar excursions: ~Love to Burn~ and ~Love and Only Love~ ran over ten minutes each, and the album as a whole lasted nearly 63 minutes with only ten songs. Much about the record had a retrospective feel -- the first two tracks, ~Country Home~ and ~White Line,~ were newly recorded versions of songs Young had played with Crazy Horse but never released in the '70s; ~Mansion on the Hill,~ the album's most accessible track, celebrated a place where ~psychedelic music fills the air~ and ~peace and love live there still~; there was a cover of the Premiers' garage rock oldie ~Farmer John~; and ~Days That Used to Be,~ in addition to its backward-looking theme, borrowed the melody from Bob Dylan's ~My Back Pages~ (by way of the Byrds' arrangement), while ~Mother Earth (Natural Anthem)~ was the folk standard ~The Water Is Wide~ with new, environmentally aware lyrics. Young was not generally known as an artist who evoked the past this much, but if he could extend his creative rebirth with music this exhilarating, no one was likely to complain.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Containing only 16 tracks, the album's songs averaged over seven and a half minutes in length, and that length was given over to extended guitar improvisations, which often were filled with feedback and distortion. Where Young's previous double live album, Live Rust, which bore some similarities to this one, was a career retrospective including some acoustic numbers, Weld was all electric rock with Crazy Horse. The one previously unreleased song was a Gulf War-era cover of Bob Dylan's ~Blowin' in the Wind,~ complete with gunshots and exploding bombs. In retrospect, Weld seems like an excellent expression of one part of Young's musical persona, putting some of his best hard rock material onto one album.

This was the perfect compliment for Young's songwriting, which was fueled by romantic notions of courtship and deep thought. Young and Nicolette Larson harmonized and became the lovers of ~You and Me,~ whereas Jack Nitzsche's string arrangements made for a nice contrast in ~Such a Woman,~ a bold-faced declaration of love.

This 73-minute tape ran seven minutes longer than the album, the extra time consisting of applause, guitar tuning, and a few scattered asides (~Aw, it's nothin', really,~ Young said, for example, after an audience member called out, ~Thank you, Neil~). Young was anything but videogenic in his leather jacket, Harley Davidson T-shirt, jeans, and boots, sitting hunched over his guitar, often scowling as he turned his face, hooded with unruly, grey-flecked hair and partially covered by a week-old stubble, to the microphone. Yet his casual appearance and introspective demeanor served to focus attention on his music. And a 14-song set that on record seemed a random selection from across his career made more sense on video, as Young began with a series of early songs, accompanying himself on guitar and harmonica, then moving to keyboards and gradually bringing other musicians on-stage to augment the sound. The songs were wistful, midtempo reflections on stardom, love, and the passage of time. Some were familiar, including ~Mr. Soul~ and ~Like a Hurricane,~ and were given new treatments; others were obscure or even previously unrecorded (~Stringman~). But all were melodic and inviting, especially the selections from Harvest Moon, including the title tune, which featured a broom as a percussion instrument. Unplugged was a low-key Neil Young performance that emphasized the consistency of his work over time and the repetition of certain lyrical themes and musical tendencies. If it avoided some of his best-known folk and country material, it did contain a few crowd-pleasers, and it brought up several forgotten tunes for reconsideration.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

				"review": "Though it once again reunites him with Crazy Horse and includes such typical rock workouts as the lengthy ~Change Your Mind~ and the raucous ~Piece of Crap,~ Sleeps With Angels is more musically varied than most of Neil Young's albums with his erstwhile backup group, ranging from piano-based ballads like the album opener, ~My Heart,~ and closer, ~A Dream That Can Last,~ which might have fit on After the Gold Rush, to the country-folk ~Train of Love,~ which sounds like a leftover from Harvest Moon, and the hard-edged grunge of the title track. The Crazy Horse influence comes in the songs' structural simplicity and the unpolished playing. Though musically diverse, Sleeps With Angels is a song cycle in which Young repeats the same themes and images. To put it simply, the album is about death, presumably primarily the suicide of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, which occurred while it was being recorded. From ~My Heart,~ which declares, ~It's not too late~ and ~Somehow, someone has a dream come true,~ to ~A Dream That Can Last,~ which declares, ~There's a better life for me someday,~ Young begins and ends with a shaky, uncertain optimism, even though his language is riddled with references to violence, especially gunfire, and desperation. As in the album's title, even the references to sleep and dreams are about death. Young repeats some of the same lines from song to song and sometimes the same music (~Western Hero~ and ~Train of Love~ have the same tune). The album thus has a tired, mournful feel that is both compelling and off-putting. Young had not investigated such forbidding territory since the days of Tonight's the Night and On the Beach, and Sleeps With Angels is on a par with those often harrowing works.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

At the start of the record, he can be heard instructing them: ~No tuning, nothing,~ and the take of ~I'm the Ocean~ is an obvious run-through that became a master take. But Pearl Jam is not Crazy Horse; in place of the latter's primitive, nonswinging sound, the former boasts spirited rhythms and dense guitar interplay that Young makes excellent use of in a series of songs built out of simple, melodic rifts. Those songs come mostly in pairs: ~Song X~ and ~Act of Love,~ the first two tracks, both seem to be about abortion, especially in its religious aspect, each containing a reference to ~the holy war~; ~What Happened to Yesterday~ and ~Fallen Angel~ are song fragments on which Young plays the pump organ; and ~Downtown~ and ~Peace and Love~ find Young addressing the musical and philosophical concerns of hippies and contain name checks of Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, and Led Zeppelin. The songs also share highly imagistic lyrics that are allusive and frequently just obscure. At their best, notably on ~I'm the Ocean~ and ~Scenery,~ they provide intriguing portraits of the artist -- ~People my age/They don't do the things I do,~ Young sings in ~Ocean~ -- while ~Scenery~ is one of his bitter denunciations of celebrity. Such subject matter is not new for Young, and Mirror Ball is typically uneven. But it is always interesting musically, suggesting that he has found another catch-up that works. Probably due to the commercial power of Pearl Jam, the album became Young's highest charting record since Harvest 23 years earlier, though it had a relatively short chart life.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Broken Arrow floats on waves of lumbering guitars and cascading feedback, ebbing and flowing with winding solos and drifting melodies. In a typical display of artistic perversion, Young has front-loaded the album with three epics with a combined running time of just over 25 minutes. Following the three epic-length songs come four concise tunes that range from the country-rock stomp of ~Changing Highways~ to the reflective ~Music Arcade.~ Like the three songs that preceded them, these songs are uneven, with hazy melodies and underdeveloped lyrics. Finally, a long, live workout of Jimmy Reed's ~Baby, What You Want Me to Do~ -- which sounds like it was taken from an audience recording -- is tacked onto the end of the album. Although the song is a standout, it raises the question: what is the purpose of Broken Arrow? The album floats from song to song, with the guitars drowning out the sound of Young's voice. There are some fine songs buried amid the long jams, but the album is directionless, and that lack of direction never manages to develop a consistent emotional tone.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

The endless delays raised hopes for the album, as did superstition — dedicated Neil Young fans believed he was creatively reborn at the end of each decade. Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, Rust Never Sleeps, and Freedom added credence to this theory, but those records were knocked out quickly, appearing a year after their predecessors. In contrast, Silver & Gold appeared four years after Broken Arrow. During those four years, all sorts of projects were in the works for Young, including a 1999 reunion with Crosby, Stills & Nash. His three songs on their comeback Looking Forward were pleasant acoustic numbers that often seemed a little slight. It was easy to assume that Young was saving the real treasures for his solo record, but Silver & Gold doesn't confirm that theory. Instead, it's a continuation of his Looking Forward contributions, performed with the warm, amiable ramble of Harvest Moon. A pleasant sound, to be sure, but not exactly what Young followers were expecting. They also may be a little dismayed to realize that two of its best songs, ~Silver & Gold~ and ~Razor Love,~ date from 1982 and 1987, respectively, suggesting that Neil may not be at the top of his game. Still, there are no truly bad songs here, although the light-hearted, light-headed reminiscence ~Buffalo Springfield Again~ treads close to the borderline. It's a low-key, charming, comfortable record, which is hardly a bad thing at all — it just doesn't quite live up to the abnormally high expectations. Fortunately, those expectations fade upon repeated plays, and Silver & Gold reveals itself as a nice Neil Young record.

				"review": "<p>For some reason, Neil Young decided that his 2000 tour was particularly hot, so he decided to record a live album and rush release it by the end of the year. So, that explains the appearance of Road Rock, Vol. 1, an eight-song collection recorded with an ensemble featuring Spooner Oldham on keyboards, Duck Dunn on bass, Jim Keltner on drums, and Astrid and Pegi Young on vocals -- thereby explaining the ~Friends & Relatives~ subtitle. This band is pretty good, even supple, but this doesn't feel necessary at any time and suffers from indulgence. And it doesn't shy away from this indulgence, either, opening with an 18-minute ~Cowgirl in the Sand~ that only diehards could sit through. And, in a sense, that summarizes this album, since only diehards will thrill to an 11-minute ~Words,~ a previously unreleased ~Fool for Your Love,~ a ten-minute ~Tonight's the Night,~ or an ~All Along the Watchtower~ featuring opener Chrissie Hynde on guitar. This isn't bad, but it's not really good, either, and as the third live album in one decade, it's not just anticlimatic, it's unnecessary even for diehards, who probably would find this more exciting as a bootleg than an official album.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Prior to its release, Greendale received more attention than any Neil Young album in years, but it wasn't positive. Young hauled out his concept album -- about an extended family in a small town called Greendale, and how they're torn apart by a murder -- to unsuspecting audiences, who by and large were not happy about spending anywhere from 55 to 85 dollars to hear a dense convoluted song cycle, complete with rambling narrative from Young, for the first hour of the show and not hearing many hits in the remainder of the set. Early in the summer of 2003, there was a brief blast of stories about this quasi-scandal, setting the stage for the late-summer release of the album: it got Young some needed press, and announced that unlike his last several albums, Young was actually trying this time around. Frankly, he needed a change. Ever since 1994's Sleeps With Angels -- or, if you're less charitable, 1990's Ragged Glory -- he had been drifting, playing with different groups, never quite mustering up enough energy to assemble a consistent set of songs whenever he headed into the studio. Here, the story and the setting give Young a hook for the record, a common theme that he can rally around, and the album benefits so much from that focus that it doesn't really matter that the story is convoluted beyond comprehension; the plot matters so much that it winds up not mattering at all. Close attention and repeated listens offer few rewards to the careful listener, because Young doesn't really say much of anything here, no matter how elaborately he says it. Learning more about the narrative -- whether it's through the simultaneously released DVD of the Young-directed film Greendale, hearing his rambling on-stage between-song narratives, or reading apparent transcriptions of these ramblings in the liner notes -- illuminates the story slightly, even as declarations like ~When I was writing this I had no idea what I was doing, so I was just as surprised as you are~ emphasize the suspicion that there's not much meaning in the whole enterprise.</p><p>All this doesn't really matter because Greendale works as a record -- it ebbs and flows and it holds together, playing as a unified whole on a level he hasn't approached since Ragged Glory. As Young says in the liner notes, these are things ~you can't tell by listening to the songs, you have to listen to the instrumentals to get this,~ and while that is meant to apply to one of the many Crazy Horse-fueled meandering improvs, it really applies to the album as a whole since Greendale connects in its overall picture, not the details. Sometimes, such as the quietly eerie and affecting ~Bandit,~ the songs stand apart from the concept, but usually the lyrics are too devoted to his winding narrative to be their own entities. Then again, Greendale was designed to be an interconnected song cycle, and if the narrative neither works nor signifies much, it nevertheless kept Young focused on the construction of the album, whether it's giving the songs memorable hooks or finding ways to make the signature ramshackle vibe of Crazy Horse sound both fresh and appropriate for this tale. It all adds up to a very good record -- one that is interesting, and one that satisfies musically. It may not be a latter-day masterpiece on the level of Dylan's Love and Theft, but it most surely is a comeback for an artist who seemed permanently adrift at sea.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Neil Young spent his 2006 hawking Living with War, an album as immediate as a news bulletin, so perhaps it made sense that after its promo push was done he would retreat into the past, planning to finally finish Archives, the long-promised box set of unreleased performances from his vaults. Two individual discs of classic live performances were released in the winter of 2006/2007, acting as a teaser for the proposed fall release of the box, but like with most things involving Neil, things didn't work precisely as planned, as he once again pushed Archives to the back burner so he could release Chrome Dreams II, a sequel to an album that never came out in the first place. The first Chrome Dreams was slated for a 1977 release, but for some indiscernible reason Young scrapped the album, parsing out some of the songs on subsequent albums, sometimes re-recording the originals, sometimes overdubbing, sometimes just sticking the previously unreleased tracks onto new albums. Among the Chrome Dreams songs that popped later are some of his greatest, including ~Like a Hurricane~ and an originally acoustic ~Powderfinger~ and ~Pocahontas,~ along with other such excellent tunes as ~Sedan Delivery,~ ~Too Far Gone,~ and ~Look Out for My Love,~ a pedigree that would suggest that Chrome Dreams II could include its fair share of major songs. Despite the inclusion of the long-bootlegged (and simply long at a lumbering 18 minutes) ~Ordinary People,~ that's not quite true: it's a modest collection of stray songs and new tunes, pieced together in a fashion similar to 1989's Freedom, which in fact is where the 1977 ~Too Far Gone~ was finally unveiled.</p><p>Indeed, Chrome Dreams II shares more similarities to Freedom than the original Chrome Dreams -- so much so that it's a mystery why it's dubbed as a sequel, but it's a mystery not worth pondering, as there are few clues to their correlation, and even if a definitive answer to their kinship could be dredged up, it wouldn't illuminate the 2007 album, which is merely a good Neil Young album. Perhaps a little more than good, actually, as this has a shagginess and tattered heart that's been missing from his work for a long time, as he's spent a good chunk of the past 15 years pursuing conceptual works, ranging from thematic concept albums (Living with War, Greendale) to musical genre exercises (Are You Passionate?, Prairie Wind). Here Neil dabbles in all his signatures, starting the album with the sweet country corn of ~Beautiful Bluebird,~ then careening to the mildly menacing minor-key groove ~Boxcar~ before he gets to the light, almost bouncy soul-pop of ~The Believer~ (complete with call-and-response backing vocals), the Crazy Horse mysticism of ~Spirit Road,~ the lazy loping country of ~Every After,~ and the elongated guitar workout of ~No Hidden Path.~ He even gets way out with ~The Way,~ singing with a children's choir, a stab at innocence that's cheerfully at odds with the sludgy ~Dirty Old Man,~ an unexpected revival of the boneheaded off-color jokes of ~Welfare Mothers,~ and then, of course, there's the album's centerpiece, ~Ordinary People,~ a winding epic recorded with the Bluenotes in 1988 that's dated in its splashy production (and perhaps its blaring horns, since Neil largely abandoned the Bluenotes after This Note's for You), yet it sounds immediate and gripping. It's the kind of song to build an album upon, which is precisely what Neil has done with Chrome Dreams II, using it as an excuse to round up other songs with no home. This doesn't make for an album that holds together thematically the way other latter-day Neil albums do, but its mess is endearing, recalling how charmingly ragged albums like After the Gold Rush, Tonight's the Night, Rust Never Sleeps, and Freedom are, even if Chrome Dreams II never manages to soar as high as those classics.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Since Prairie Wind is a return to the soft, lush country-rock sound of Harvest; since Neil Young suffered a brain aneurysm during its recording; since it finds the singer/songwriter reflecting on life and family in the wake of his father's death; and since it's his most cohesive album in a decade, it would seem that all these factors add up to a latter-day masterpiece for Young, but that's not quite the case. Prairie Wind manages to be less than the sum of its parts and the problem isn't a lack of good songs (although it does have a few more clunkers than it should) or a botched concept. Young's decision to revive the country-rock that brought him his greatest popularity never feels like a cynical move -- the music is too warm, comfortable, and friendly to feel like anything but Neil playing to his strengths. However, since he cut this in Nashville with a bunch of studio pros including legendary keyboardist Spooner Oldham, it feels just a tad slicker than perhaps it should, since the smooth sound inadvertently highlights the sentimentality of the project. It's hard to begrudge Young if he wants to indulge in rose-colored memories -- a brush with death coupled with a loss of a parent tends to bring out sentimentality -- but such backward-gazing songs as ~Far from Home~ feel just a hair too close to trite, and the easy-rolling nature of the record doesn't lend them much gravity. There a few other songs that tend toward too close to the simplistic, whether it's the specific invocations of 9/11 and Chris Rock on ~No Wonder~ or the supremely silly Elvis salute ~He Was the King,~ which are just enough to undermine the flow of the album, even if they fit into the general autumnal, reflective mood of the record. But since they do fit the overall feel of the album, and since they're better, even with their flaws, than the best songs on, say, Silver & Gold or Broken Arrow or Are You Passionate?, they help elevate the whole of Prairie Wind, particularly because there are some genuinely strong Young songs here: the moody opener ~The Painter,~ the gently sighing ~Fallin' off the Face of the Earth,~ the ethereal ~It's a Dream,~ the sweet, laid-back ~Here for Your,~ the understated ~This Old Guitar~ (there's also the sweeping ~When God Made Me,~ recorded complete with a gospel chorus, one that will either strike a listener as moving or maudlin -- a latter-day ~A Man Needs a Maid,~ only not as strong). This set of songs does indeed make Prairie Wind a better album than anything Young has released in the past decade, which means that it's easy to overrate it. For despite all of its strengths, neither the recording nor the songs are as memorable or as fully realized as his late-'80s/early-'90s comeback records -- Freedom, Ragged Glory, and Harvest Moon -- let alone his classic '70s work. Nevertheless, it's the closest Young has come to making a record that could hold its own with those albums in well over a decade, which means it's worthwhile even if it's never quite as great as it seems like it could have been.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"firstname": "Frank",

		"name": "Frank Zappa",
		"biography": "<p>Composer, guitarist, singer, and bandleader Frank Zappa was a singular musical figure during a performing and recording career that lasted from the 1960s to the '90s. His disparate influences included doo wop music and avant-garde classical music; although he led groups that could be called rock & roll bands for much of his career, he used them to create a hybrid style that bordered on jazz and complicated, modern serious music, sometimes inducing orchestras to play along. As if his music were not challenging enough, he overlay it with highly satirical and sometimes abstractly humorous lyrics and song titles that marked him as coming out of a provocative literary tradition that included Beat poets like Allen Ginsberg and edgy comedians like Lenny Bruce. Nominally, he was a popular musician, but his recordings rarely earned significant airplay or sales, yet he was able to gain control of his recorded work and issue it successfully through his own labels while also touring internationally, in part because of the respect he earned from a dedicated cult of fans and many serious musicians, and also because he was an articulate spokesman who promoted himself into a media star through extensive interviews he considered to be a part of his creative effort just like his music. The Mothers of Invention, the '60s group he led, often seemed to offer a parody of popular music and the counterculture (although he affected long hair and jeans, Zappa was openly scornful of hippies and drug use). By the '80s, he was testifying before Congress in opposition to censorship (and editing his testimony into one of his albums). But these comic and serious sides were complementary, not contradictory. In statement and in practice, Zappa was an iconoclastic defender of the freest possible expression of ideas. And most of all, he was a composer far more ambitious than any other rock musician of his time and most classical musicians, as well.</p><p>Zappa was born Frank Vincent Zappa in Baltimore, MD, on December 21, 1940. For most of his life, he was under the mistaken impression that he had been named exactly after his father, a Sicilian immigrant who was a high school teacher at the time of his son's birth, that he was ~Francis Vincent Zappa, Jr.~ That was what he told interviewers, and it was extensively reported. It was only many years later that Zappa examined his birth certificate and discovered that, in fact, his first name was Frank, not Francis. The real Francis Zappa took a job with the Navy during World War II, and he spent the rest of his career working in one capacity or another for the government or in the defense industry, resulting in many family moves. Zappa's mother, Rose Marie (Colimore) Zappa, was a former librarian and typist. During his early childhood, the family lived in Baltimore, Opa-Locka, FL, and Edgewood, MD. In December 1951, they moved to California when Zappa's father took a job teaching metallurgy at the Naval Post-Graduate School in Monterey. The same year, Zappa had first shown an interest in becoming a musician, joining the school band and playing the snare drum.</p><p>Although the Zappa family continued to live in California for the rest of Zappa's childhood, they still moved frequently; by the time Zappa graduated from Antelope Valley Joint Union High School in Lancaster in June 1958, it was the seventh high school he had attended. Meanwhile, his interest in music had grown. He had become particularly attracted to R&B, joining a band as a drummer in 1955. Simultaneously, he had become a fan of avant-garde classical music, particularly the work of Edgard Varèse. After his high school graduation, Zappa studied music at several local colleges off and on. He also switched to playing the guitar.</p><p>Zappa married Kathryn J. Sherman on December 28, 1960; the marriage ended in divorce in 1964. Meanwhile, he played in bands and worked on the scores of low-budget films. It was in seeking to record his score for one of these films, The World's Greatest Sinner, that he began working at the tiny Pal recording studio in Cucamonga, CA, run by Paul Buff, in November 1961. He and Buff began writing and recording pop music with studio groups and licensing the results to such labels as Del-Fi Records and Original Sound Records. On August 1, 1964, Zappa bought the studio from Buff and renamed it Studio Z. On March 26, 1965, he was arrested by a local undercover police officer who had entrapped him by asking him to record a pornographic audiotape. Convicted of a misdemeanor, he spent ten days in jail, an experience that embittered him. After completing his sentence, he closed the studio, moved into Los Angeles, and joined a band called the Soul Giants that featured his friend, singer Ray Collins, along with bass player Roy Estrada and drummer Jimmy Carl Black. In short order, he induced the group to play his original compositions instead of covers, and to change their name to the Mothers (reportedly on Mother's Day, May 10, 1965).</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/freak-out.jpg~ alt=~Freak Out!~><p>In Los Angeles, the Mothers were able to obtain a manager, Herb Cohen, and audition successfully to appear in popular nightclubs such as the Whiskey Go-Go by the fall of 1965. There they were seen by record executive Tom Wilson, who signed them to the Verve Records subsidiary of MGM Records on March 1, 1966. (Verve required that the suggestive name ~The Mothers~ be modified to ~The Mothers of Invention.~) The contract called for the group to submit five albums in two years, and they immediately went into the studio to record the first of those albums, Freak Out! By this time, Elliot Ingber had joined the group on guitar, making it a quintet. An excess of material and Zappa's agreement to accept a reduced publishing royalty led to the highly unusual decision to release it as a double-LP, an unprecedented indulgence for a debut act that was practically unheard, much less for an established one. (Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde appeared during the same period, but it was his seventh album.)</p><p>Freak Out! was released on June 27, 1966. It was not an immediate success commercially, but it entered the Billboard chart for the week ending February 11, 1967, and eventually spent 23 weeks in the charts. In July 1966, Zappa met Adelaide Gail Sloatman; they married in September 1967, prior to the birth, on September 28, 1967, of their first child, a daughter named Moon Unit Zappa who would record with her father. She was followed by a son, Dweezil, on September 5, 1969. He, too, would become a recording artist, as would Ahmet Zappa, born May 15, 1974. A fourth child, Diva, was born in August 1979. During the summer of 1966, Zappa hired drummer Denny Bruce and keyboardist Don Preston, making the Mothers of Invention a septet, but by November 1966, when the Mothers of Invention went back into the studio to record their second album, Absolutely Free, Bruce had been replaced by Billy Mundi; Ingber had been replaced by Jim Fielder; and Zappa had hired two horn players, Bunk Gardner on wind instruments and Jim ~Motorhead~ Sherwood on saxophone, bringing the band up to a nine-piece unit. The album was recorded in four days and released in June 1967. It entered the charts in July and reached the Top 50.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/lumpy-gravy.jpg~ alt=~Lumpy Gravy~><p>The Mothers of Invention moved to New York City in November 1966 for a booking at a Greenwich Village club called the Balloon Farm that began on Thanksgiving Day and ran through New Year's Day, 1967. After a two-week stint in Montreal, they returned to California, where Fielder left the group in February. In March, Zappa began recording his first solo album, Lumpy Gravy, having signed to Capitol Records under the impression that he was not signed as an individual to Verve, a position Verve would dispute. Later that month, the Mothers of Invention returned to New York City for another extended engagement at the Garrick Theater in Greenwich Village that ran during Easter week and was sufficiently successful that Herb Cohen booked the theater for the summer. That run began on May 24, 1967, and ran off and on through September 5. During this period, Ian Underwood joined the band, playing saxophone and piano. In August, the group began recording its third album, We're Only in It for the Money.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/sgt-peppers.jpg~ alt=~Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band~><p>In September 1967, the Mothers of Invention toured Europe for the first time, playing in the U.K., Sweden, and Denmark. On October 1, Verve failed to exercise its option to extend the band's contract, although they still owed the label three more LPs. They finished recording We're Only in It for the Money in October, but its release was held up because of legal concerns about its proposed cover photograph, an elaborate parody of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which was finally resolved by putting the picture on the inside of the fold-out LP sleeve. We're Only in It for the Money was released on March 4, 1968, and it reached the Top 30. Another legal dispute was resolved when Verve purchased the tapes of Lumpy Gravy from Capitol. Zappa then finished recording this orchestral work, and Verve released it under his name (and that of ~the Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra and Chorus~) on May 13, 1968; it spent five weeks in the charts.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/uncle-meat.jpg~ alt=~Uncle Meat~><p>Although the Mothers of Invention still owed one more LP to Verve, Zappa already was thinking ahead. In the fall of 1967, he began recording Uncle Meat, the soundtrack for a proposed film, with work continuing through February 1968. During this period, Billy Mundi left the band and was replaced on drums by Arthur Dyer Tripp III. In March, Zappa and Herb Cohen announced that they were setting up their own record label, Bizarre Records, to be distributed by the Reprise Records subsidiary of Warner Bros. Records. The label was intended to record not only the Mothers of Invention, but also acts Zappa discovered. Early in the summer, Ray Collins quit the Mothers of Invention, who continued to tour. Their performance at the Royal Festival Hall in London on October 25, 1968, was released in 1991 as the album Ahead of Their Time. That month, Bizarre was formally launched with the release of the single ~The Circle,~ by Los Angeles street singer Wild Man Fischer. In November, guitarist Lowell George joined the Mothers of Invention. In December, Verve released the band's final album on its contract, Cruisin' with Ruben & the Jets, on which Zappa for once played it straight, leading the group through a set of apparently sincere doo wop and R&B material. The LP spent 12 weeks in the charts. (Zappa was then free of Verve, although his disputes with the company were not over. Verve put out a compilation, Mothermania: The Best of the Mothers, in March 1969, and it spent nine weeks in the charts.)</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/pretties-for-you.jpg~ alt=~Pretties for You~><p>The ambitious double-LP Uncle Meat, the fifth Mothers of Invention album, was released by Bizarre on April 21, 1969. It reached the Top 50. (The movie it was supposed to accompany did not appear until a home video release in 1989.) In May, Bizarre released Pretties for You, the debut album by Alice Cooper, the only act discovered by the label that would go on to substantial success (after switching to Warner Bros. Records proper, that is).The same month, Lowell George left the band; later, he and Roy Estrada would form Little Feat. Zappa began working on a second solo album, Hot Rats, in July 1969. On August 19, the Mothers of Invention gave their final performance in their original form, playing on Canadian TV at the end of a tour. One week later, Zappa announced that he was breaking up the band, although, as it turned out, this did not mean that he would not use the name ~the Mothers of Invention~ for groups he led in the future. Hot Rats, the second album to be credited to Frank Zappa, was released on October 10, 1969. It spent only six weeks in the charts at the time, but it would become one of Zappa's best-loved collections, with the instrumental ~Peaches en Regalia~ a particular favorite. Although the Mothers of Invention no longer existed as a performing unit, Zappa possessed extensive tapes of them, live and in the studio, and using that material, he assembled a new album, Burnt Weeny Sandwich, released in February 1970; it made the Top 100.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/200-motels.jpg~ alt=~200 Motels~><p>At the invitation of Zubin Mehta, conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, Zappa assembled a new group of rock musicians dubbed the Mothers for the performance, with the orchestra, of a work called 200 Motels at UCLA on May 15, 1970. Adding singers Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, formerly of the Turtles, Zappa launched a tour with this version of the Mothers in June 1970. (Also included were a returning Ian Underwood, keyboardist George Duke, drummer Aynsley Dunbar, and guitarist Jeff Simmons.) In August, Bizarre released another archival Mothers of Invention album, Weasels Ripped My Flesh, which charted. Chunga's Revenge, released in October, was billed as a Zappa solo album, even though it featured the current lineup of the Mothers; it spent 14 weeks in the charts. After touring the U.S. that fall, the group went to Europe on December 1. From January 28 to February 5, 1971, they were in Pinewood Studios in the U.K. making a movie version of 200 Motels with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and co-stars Theodore Bikel, Ringo Starr, and Keith Moon of the Who. Zappa had planned a concert with the Royal Philharmonic at the Royal Albert Hall on February 8 as a money-saving tactic, since according to union rules, he could then pay them for the filming/recording session as if it were rehearsals for the concert. But this strategy backfired when the Royal Albert Hall canceled the concert, alleging that Zappa's lyrics were too vulgar. He added to his expenses by suing the Royal Albert Hall, eventually losing in court.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/fillmore-east.jpg~ alt=~Fillmore East: June 1971~><p>On June 5 and 6, 1971, the Mothers appeared during the closing week of the Fillmore East theater in New York City, recording their shows for a live album, Fillmore East, June 1971, quickly released on August 2. It became Zappa's first album to reach the Top 40 since We're Only in It for the Money three years earlier. John Lennon and Yoko Ono had appeared as guests during the June 6 show, and they used their performance on their 1972 album Some Time in New York City. The Mothers gave a concert at the Pauley Pavilion at UCLA on August 7, 1971, and the show was recorded for the album Just Another Band from L.A., released in May 1972, which made the Top 100. They continued to tour into the fall. 200 Motels premiered in movie theaters on October 29, 1971, with a double-LP soundtrack album released by United Artists that made the Top 100. Meanwhile, the Mothers' European tour was eventful, to say the least. On December 4, 1971, the group appeared at the Montreux Casino in Geneva, Switzerland, but their show stopped when a fan fired off a flare gun that set the venue on fire. The incident was the inspiration for Deep Purple's song ~Smoke on the Water.~ Six days later, as the Mothers were performing at the Rainbow Theatre in London on December 10, a deranged fan jumped on-stage and pushed Zappa into the orchestra pit. He suffered a broken ankle, among other injuries, and was forced to recuperate for months. This was the end both of the tour and of this edition of the Mothers.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/waka-jawaka.jpg~ alt=~Waka/Jawaka~><p>While convalescing at home in Los Angeles, Zappa organized a new big band to play jazz-fusion music; he dubbed it the Grand Wazoo Orchestra and recorded two albums with it. Waka/Jawaka, billed as a Zappa solo album, came out in July 1972 and spent seven weeks in the charts. The Grand Wazoo, credited to the Mothers, appeared in December and missed the charts. By September 10, Zappa felt well enough to play two weeks of dates with the group, now billed as the Mothers, starting at the Hollywood Bowl. He then cut the personnel down to ten pieces (the ~Petit Wazoo~ band) and toured from late October to mid-December.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/over-nite-sensation.jpg~ alt=~Over-Nite Sensation~><p>The start of 1973 marked a new and surprisingly popular phase in Zappa's career. He assembled a new lineup of Mothers, made a batch of new recordings on which he himself sang lead vocals (his voice having dropped half an octave as a result of injuring his neck when he was thrown from the stage), and hit the road for the most extensive touring of his career. Inaugurating the new band in Fayetteville, NC, on February 23, he spent 183 days of 1973 on the road, including tours of the U.S., Europe, and Australia. Meanwhile, the Bizarre Records deal with Reprise/Warner had run out, and he launched a new label, also distributed by Warner, DiscReet Records, its first release being Over-Nite Sensation in September 1973. The album reached the Top 40, stayed in the charts nearly a year, and went gold. It was followed in April 1974 by a Zappa solo album, Apostrophe (‘). Much to Zappa's surprise, radio stations began playing a track called ~Don't Eat the Yellow Snow.~ A single edit of the song actually spent several weeks in the lower reaches of the Hot 100, and Apostrophe (‘) peaked at number ten for the week ending June 29, 1974, the highest chart position ever achieved by a Zappa album. The LP also went gold.</p><p>Roxy & ElsewhereZappa continued to tour extensively in 1974. His next album, the double-LP live collection Roxy & Elsewhere, credited to ~Zappa/Mothers,~ appeared in September 1974 and made the Top 30. Adding his old friend Captain Beefheart to the band, he played shows at the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin, TX, on May 20 and 21, 1975, that he recorded for the album Bongo Fury, credited to Frank Zappa/Captain Beefheart/The Mothers, released in October; it made the Top 100. Prior to that had come One Size Fits All, credited to Frank Zappa & the Mothers of Invention, released in June; it made the Top 30. On September 17 and 18, 1975, two concerts of Zappa's orchestral music were performed by a group dubbed the Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra (in memory of Lumpy Gravy) and conducted by Michael Zearott at Royce Hall, UCLA. The shows were recorded, but the material was not released until May 1979 as Orchestral Favorites, which spent several weeks in the charts. Starting on September 27, 1975, Zappa launched another extended period of touring, staying in the U.S. through a New Years concert at the Forum in Los Angeles, then playing in Australia, Japan, and Europe, finishing on March 17, 1976. This ended another phase in his career. He split with his longtime manager Herb Cohen and disbanded his group, which, because of legal disputes with Cohen, would turn out to have been the last one called the Mothers or the Mothers of Invention. Hereafter, he would perform and record simply as Frank Zappa. There were also other legal issues. In October 1976, he reached an out-of-court settlement in a suit he had waged against MGM/Verve that resulted in his winning the rights to the masters of his early albums.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/good-singin.jpg~ alt=~Good Singin', Good Playin'~><p>Zappa surprised fans when his name turned up as the producer of a new album by Grand Funk Railroad, Good Singin', Good Playin', in August 1976. In September, he launched his first world tour under his own name, playing in the U.S., the Far East, and Europe through February 1977. Zoot Allures, the last album to be credited to the Mothers, was released on Warner Bros. Records on October 29, 1976, the DiscReet label apparently being claimed by Cohen; it reached the Top 100. Zappa was also seeking to end his deal with Warner. In March 1977, he delivered four albums to the label simultaneously (the initial titles were Studio Tan, Hot Rats III [Waka/Jawaka having counted as Hot Rats II], Zappa's Orchestral Favorites, and the double album Live in New York, recorded in December 1976); he demanded the four $60,000 advances the albums called for, and sued Warner for breach of contract when it did not pay. In the summer of 1977, he announced that he had concluded his contract with Warner. He declared that the four albums really constituted a single work called Leather (later spelled Läther), which he sold to Mercury/Phonogram Records. Warner then sued to block its release.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/zappa-in-new-york.jpg~ alt=~Zappa in New York~><p>On September 8, 1977, Zappa launched another North American tour, staying on the road until New Year's Eve. His shows from October 28-31 at the Palladium in New York City were filmed and recorded, the material later emerging in the movie Baby Snakes. The European leg of the tour opened in London on January 24, 1978. The resolutions of Zappa's legal disputes led to an unusually large number of releases over the next year. Zappa in New York (originally called Live in New York) was released on DiscReet in March 1978 and made the Top 100. Studio Tan appeared in September 1978 and charted. Sleep Dirt (originally called Hot Rats III) was released in January 1979 and charted. Orchestral Favorites completed the releases of the material Zappa had delivered to Warner in March 1977. With these matters settled, Zappa launched Zappa Records, with distribution through Mercury/Phonogram in the U.S. and CBS Records in the rest of the world, releasing the double-LP Sheik Yerbouti on March 3, 1979. The album managed to distinguish itself from all the other Zappa albums in the record bins and peaked at number 21, Zappa's best showing in five years, promoted by the single ~Dancin' Fool,~ which made the Top 50. That track was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance (Male), and ~Rat Tomago,~ another track on the album, got a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/joes-garage.jpg~ alt=~Joe's Garage: Act I~><p>Zappa toured Europe and Japan in the spring of 1979, then returned to the U.S., where he completed work on his home studio, called the Utility Muffin Research Kitchen, on September 1. The home studio and his continuing practice of recording his shows, along with greater control over his record releases, seemed to free Zappa to issue more records. Joe's Garage Act I was released in September 1979 and made the Top 30; it was followed in November by the double-LP Joe's Garage Acts II & III, which made the Top 100. Baby Snakes, the film of the 1977 Halloween shows in New York, opened on December 21, 1979. A soundtrack album did not appear until 1983. Zappa spent much of 1980 on the road, beginning a tour of North America and Europe on March 25, with dates continuing through July 3, and then touring again from October 10 through Christmas.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/tinseltown-rebellion.jpg~ alt=~Tinseltown Rebellion~><p>Amazingly, Zappa did not release an album during 1980. (A single, ~I Don't Wanna Get Drafter,~ just missed making the Hot 100 in May.) But he made up for that in 1981. In May, yet another new label, Barking Pumpkin Records, was launched with the release of a double-LP, Tinseltown Rebellion, which made the Top 100. By now, Zappa had perfected a method of melding studio and live performances on his records, such that the finished versions were a combination of the two. Also in May 1981, he simultaneously released three instrumental albums via mail order: Shut Up ‘N Play Yer Guitar, Shut Up ‘N Play Yer Guitar Some More, and Return of the Son of Shut Up ‘N Play Yer Guitar. In September came another double album, You Are What You Is, that made the Top 100.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/ship-arriving.jpg~ alt=~Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch~><p>Zappa's spring/summer tour of Europe in 1982 was plagued with problems including canceled dates and even a riot at one show; after finishing the stint on July 14, he did not tour again for two years. Meanwhile, on May 3, 1982, he released a new album, Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch, and it featured another of his surprise hit singles, as radio picked up on ~Valley Girl,~ a track featuring a vocal by his daughter Moon Unit Zappa, imitating the character and employing the slang of a typical Southern California valley girl. The song peaked at number 32 on September 11, 1982, making it the most successful single of Zappa's career. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. The album made the Top 30. After coming off the road, Zappa concentrated on recording and on his orchestral music. On January 11, 1983, conductor Kent Nagano led the London Symphony Orchestra in a concert of Zappa's works at the Barbican Arts Centre in London, preparatory to three days of recordings that resulted, initially, in the album London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. 1, released in June 1983. (A second volume followed in September 1987.) Prior to that, Zappa had released a new rock album, The Man from Utopia, on March 28, 1983, which charted for several weeks.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/boulez.jpg~ alt=~Boulez Conducts Zappa: The Perfect Stranger~><p>As he had the year before, Zappa saw some of his orchestral music recorded in January 1984, this time by the Ensemble InterContemporain of conductor Pierre Boulez. With other material, these recordings would be released by Angel Records on August 23, 1984, as Boulez Conducts Zappa: The Perfect Stranger. The other material was Zappa's own recording on an advanced synthesizer instrument he had purchased called the Synclavier, capable of replicating orchestral arrangements. The Synclavier freed Zappa from the technical limitations (and, in some cases, the objections) of live musicians, especially classical musicians, and he turned to it increasingly from this point on. Having discovered manuscripts of music composed in the 18th century by an ancestor of his, Francesco Zappa, he recorded an album of it on the Synclavier in March 1984, releasing the results on an LP called Francesco Zappa on November 21, 1984.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/them-or-us.jpg~ alt=~Them or Us~><p>On July 18, 1984, two years after the end of his last tour, Zappa went back on the road for an extensive, worldwide trek that ran through December 23. On October 18, he released a two-LP set, Them or Us. A month later came the triple-LP box set, Thing-Fish, on the same day as the Francesco Zappa album. By this time, Zappa's records were no longer reaching the charts, as he focused on his existing fan base, heavily marketing to them through mail order. Having re-acquired the masters to his Verve/MGM albums, he had found the tapes in dire condition and had re-recorded the bass and drum parts for the albums We're Only in It for the Money and Cruisin' with Ruben and the Jets, which were part of a box set he offered to his mailing list, The Old Masters Box 1, in April 1985. (The Old Masters Box 2 followed in 1986, and the series was completed with The Old Masters Box 3 in 1987.)</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/prevention.jpg~ alt=~Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention~><p>During the year 1985, a group of wives of prominent politicians in Washington, D.C., formed the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) and lobbed Congress for restrictions on what they saw as obscenity in popular music. Zappa, long an opponent of censorship, became a leader of the opposition to the PMRC, and on September 19, 1985, he testified before the Senate Commerce Technology and Transportation Committee to voice his opinions. Of course, his testimony was a matter of public record, and he quickly used the recordings in an album he assembled called Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention, released in November 1985. In January 1986, it became his 33rd and last album to reach the Billboard chart.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/jazz-from-hell.jpg~ alt=~Jazz from Hell~><p>In January 1986, a Zappa live album drawn from the 1984 tour, Does Humor Belong in Music?, was released in Europe, but quickly withdrawn. It was an accompaniment to a home video of the same name that was taken from a single date on the tour. The album was later reissued with a new mix. Meanwhile, Zappa signed a contract with the independent CD label Rykodisc to reissue his albums on CD. The reissue program was launched in the fall of the year. At the same time, Zappa released a new instrumental album largely consisting of material recorded on the Synclavier, Jazz from Hell. The album won him his first Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance (Orchestra, Group or Soloist), and the track ~Jazz from Hell~ itself earned a nomination for Best Instrumental Composition.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/guitar.jpg~ alt=~Guitar~><p>On February 2, 1988, Zappa launched what would prove to be his final tour, playing 81 dates in North America and Europe through June 9. Meanwhile, he continued to issue new recordings. In April came a double album of guitar solos in the manner of the Shut Up ‘N Play Yer Guitar series, simply called Guitar, and the first in a series of double-CD archival live recordings, You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 1. In typically unusual Zappa style, the series found him editing together live performances by different configurations of the Mothers and his backup bands at different times. By 1992, the series extended to six volumes. The second volume, which actually replicated a single concert performed in Helsinki in 1974, appeared in October 1988 at the same time as an album of recordings from the 1988 tour, Broadway the Hard Way. Launching a home video line, Honker, in 1989, Zappa finally issued Uncle Meat on VHS tape, along with the documentary The True Story of 200 Motels and Video from Hell. (The following year, Honker issued The Amazing Mr. Bickford, a documentary about the animator responsible for the clay animation work seen in Baby Snakes.) In May 1989, Zappa published his autobiography, The Real Frank Zappa Book, co-authored with Peter Occhiogrosso. And in another surprising non-musical career development in 1989, Zappa began traveling to Russia as a business liaison. These efforts were extended in January 1990, when he went to Czechoslovakia, where he met the recently installed president, playwright and Zappa fan Václav Havel, and agreed to become a trade representative for the country. Understandably, this ran afoul of the Administration of American President George Bush, however, and Zappa's role became unofficial.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/the-best-band.jpg~ alt=~The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life~><p>It's hard to say what might have come of Zappa's trade efforts with the former Soviet Union and the former Iron Curtain countries, where he was something of a cultural hero. In May 1990, he suddenly canceled scheduled appearances in Europe and returned to the U.S. due to illness. He managed to go to Czechoslovakia and Hungary in June 1991, however. In the meantime, he continued to issue volumes of the You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore series and albums drawn from the 1988 tour, The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life in April 1991, and Make a Jazz Noise Here in June 1991. In July 1991, in yet another unusual marketing move, he assembled a collection of eight bootleg albums that had appeared over the years and offered his own version of them (mastered directly from the bootleg LPs themselves) as a box set called Beat the Boots; the albums were also released individually, and a second Beat the Boots box was released in June 1992.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-left~ src=~/images/the-yellow-shark.jpg~ alt=~The Yellow Shark~><p>Zappa was scheduled to appear in New York for a performance by a group of alumni from his bands called ~Zappa's Universe~ on November 7, 1991. When he was unable to attend due to illness, his children explained publicly for the first time that he was suffering from prostate cancer. He managed to fly to Germany on July 13, 1992, to work with the Ensemble Modern on a piece it had commissioned from him, The Yellow Shark, and he was present for concerts it performed in September. In October, Zappa released Playground Psychotics, an archival album of previously unreleased material from the 1970-1971 edition of the Mothers. The Yellow Shark was released in November 1993. Zappa died at age 52 on December 4, 1993.</p><div class=~clearfix~></div><img class=~img-fluid rounded float-right~ src=~/images/civilization.jpg~ alt=~Civilization Phaze III~><p>After Zappa's death, his widow sold his existing catalog outright to Rykodisc. But, like such well-established rock artists as the Grateful Dead, he had produced a tremendous archive of studio and live recordings that Gail Zappa was able to assemble into posthumous albums for his legions of fans. The first of these was the ambitious Civilization Phaze III, which Zappa was working on in the period up to his death, released in December 1994, and other albums, either containing concerts or other material, have also appeared, along with expanded versions of previously released albums such as Freak Out! Decades after Zappa's death, this stream of releases showed no evidence of stopping, as long as Zappa fans were interested in buying.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>",

Other than another side project -- the doo wop tribute Cruising With Ruben and the Jets -- Hot Rats was also the first time Zappa focused his efforts in one general area, namely jazz-rock. The result is a classic of the genre. Hot Rats' genius lies in the way it fuses the compositional sophistication of jazz with rock's down-and-dirty attitude -- there's a real looseness and grit to the three lengthy jams, and a surprising, wry elegance to the three shorter, tightly arranged numbers (particularly the sumptuous ~Peaches en Regalia~). Perhaps the biggest revelation isn't the straightforward presentation, or the intricately shifting instrumental voices in Zappa's arrangements -- it's his own virtuosity on the electric guitar, recorded during extended improvisational workouts for the first time here. His wonderfully scuzzy, distorted tone is an especially good fit on ~Willie the Pimp,~ with its greasy blues riffs and guest vocalist Captain Beefheart's Howlin' Wolf theatrics. Elsewhere, his skill as a melodist was in full flower, whether dominating an entire piece or providing a memorable theme as a jumping-off point. In addition to Underwood, the backing band featured contributions from Jean-Luc Ponty, Lowell George, and Don ~Sugarcane~ Harris, among others; still, Zappa is unquestionably the star of the show. Hot Rats still sizzles; few albums originating on the rock side of jazz-rock fusion flowed so freely between both sides of the equation, or achieved such unwavering excitement and energy.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Steve Huey</strong></p><hr/><p>Frank Zappa – guitar, octave bass, percussion</p><p>Ian Underwood – piano, organus maximus, flute, all clarinets, all saxes</p><p>Captain Beefheart – vocals on ~Willie the Pimp~</p><p>Max Bennett – bass on all tracks except ~Peaches en Regalia~</p><p>Shuggie Otis – bass on ~Peaches en Regalia~</p><p>John Guerin – drums on ~Willie the Pimp~, ~Little Umbrellas~ and ~It Must Be a Camel~</p><p>Paul Humphrey – drums on ~Son of Mr. Green Genes~ and ~The Gumbo Variations~</p><p>Ron Selico – drums on ~Peaches en Regalia~</p><p>Don ~Sugarcane~ Harris – violin on ~Willie the Pimp~ and ~The Gumbo Variations~</p><p>Jean-Luc Ponty – violin on ~It Must Be a Camel~</p><p>Lowell George – rhythm guitar (uncredited)</p>"

				"review": "<p>Chunga's Revenge marks the debut of Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan (among several other musicians) with the Mothers, and while their schtick has not reached the graphic proportions it later would, the thematic obsessions of the 200 Motels period are foreshadowed on tracks like ~Road Ladies~ and ~Would You Go All the Way?~ Other vocal numbers include the hard-rocking ~Tell Me You Love Me,~ the musicians' union satire ~Rudy Wants to Buy Yez a Drink,~ and the doo wop-influenced ~Sharleena.~ Meanwhile, Frank Zappa's strong instrumental music incorporates Eastern European influences (~Transylvania Boogie~), cocktail jazz (~Twenty Small Cigars~), and the percussion-only ~The Clap.~ Zappa's guitar tone is wonderfully biting and nasty throughout; George Duke provides another musical highlight by scat-singing a ~drum solo.~ But while there are plenty of fine moments, Chunga's Revenge is in the end more of a hodgepodge transitional album, with less coherence than Zappa's other 1969-1970 works. Still, it will appeal to fans of that creatively fertile period in Zappa's oeuvre.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>François Couture</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Burnt Weeny Sandwich is the first of two albums by the Mothers of Invention that Frank Zappa released in 1970, after he had disbanded the original lineup. While Weasels Ripped My Flesh focuses on complex material and improvised stage madness, this collection of studio and live recordings summarizes the leader's various interests and influences at the time. It opens and closes on '50s pop covers, ~WPLJ~ and ~Valarie.~ ~Aybe Sea~ is a Zappafied sea shanty, while ~Igor's Boogie~ is named after composer Igor Stravinsky, the closest thing to a hero Zappa ever worshipped. But the best material is represented by ~Holiday in Berlin,~ a theme that would become central to the music of 200 Motels, and ~The Little House I Used to Live In,~ including a virtuoso piano solo by Ian Underwood. Presented as an extended set of theme and variations, the latter does not reach the same heights as ~King Kong.~ In many places, and with the two aforementioned exceptions in mind, Burnt Weeny Sandwich sounds like a set of outtakes from Uncle Meat, which already summarized to an extent the adventures of the early Mothers. It lacks some direction, but those allergic to the group's grunts and free-form playing will prefer it to the wacky Weasels Ripped My Flesh.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>François Couture</strong></p>"

				"review": "<p>Aside from the experimental side project Lumpy Gravy, Hot Rats was the first album Frank Zappa recorded as a solo artist sans the Mothers, though he continued to employ previous musical collaborators, most notably multi-instrumentalist Ian Underwood. Other than another side project -- the doo wop tribute Cruising With Ruben and the Jets -- Hot Rats was also the first time Zappa focused his efforts in one general area, namely jazz-rock. The result is a classic of the genre. Hot Rats' genius lies in the way it fuses the compositional sophistication of jazz with rock's down-and-dirty attitude -- there's a real looseness and grit to the three lengthy jams, and a surprising, wry elegance to the three shorter, tightly arranged numbers (particularly the sumptuous ~Peaches en Regalia~). Perhaps the biggest revelation isn't the straightforward presentation, or the intricately shifting instrumental voices in Zappa's arrangements -- it's his own virtuosity on the electric guitar, recorded during extended improvisational workouts for the first time here. His wonderfully scuzzy, distorted tone is an especially good fit on ~Willie the Pimp,~ with its greasy blues riffs and guest vocalist Captain Beefheart's Howlin' Wolf theatrics. Elsewhere, his skill as a melodist was in full flower, whether dominating an entire piece or providing a memorable theme as a jumping-off point. In addition to Underwood, the backing band featured contributions from Jean-Luc Ponty, Lowell George, and Don ~Sugarcane~ Harris, among others; still, Zappa is unquestionably the star of the show. Hot Rats still sizzles; few albums originating on the rock side of jazz-rock fusion flowed so freely between both sides of the equation, or achieved such unwavering excitement and energy.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Steve Huey</strong></p><hr/><p>Frank Zappa – guitar, octave bass, percussion</p><p>Ian Underwood – piano, organus maximus, flute, all clarinets, all saxes</p><p>Captain Beefheart – vocals on ~Willie the Pimp~</p><p>Max Bennett – bass on all tracks except ~Peaches en Regalia~</p><p>Shuggie Otis – bass on ~Peaches en Regalia~</p><p>John Guerin – drums on ~Willie the Pimp~, ~Little Umbrellas~ and ~It Must Be a Camel~</p><p>Paul Humphrey – drums on ~Son of Mr. Green Genes~ and ~The Gumbo Variations~</p><p>Ron Selico – drums on ~Peaches en Regalia~</p><p>Don ~Sugarcane~ Harris – violin on ~Willie the Pimp~ and ~The Gumbo Variations~</p><p>Jean-Luc Ponty – violin on ~It Must Be a Camel~</p><p>Lowell George – rhythm guitar (uncredited)</p>"
